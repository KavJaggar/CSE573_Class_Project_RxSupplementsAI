            "Overview": "Cabbage is one of several crop varieties of the Brassica oleracea species, others of which include kale, broccoli, Brussels sprout, and cauliflower (93674, 93676). Different types of cabbage are cultivated and vary in shape, size, and leaf color. Cabbage is typically consumed in either raw, boiled, or fermented form (93676).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods.\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts (18). ...when used topically and appropriately, short-term. Topical application of cabbage leaves has been general well-tolerated in short-term studies (6781, 6782, 6783, 6784, 93671, 110558). However, pain, itching, and burning with topical use of cabbage leaves have been reported in some patients leaving cabbage leaf wraps in place for 2-4 hours (93671, 93675).\nPREGNANCY: There is insufficient reliable information available about using cabbage in medicinal amounts during pregnancy; avoid using.\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used topically and appropriately, short-term.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nTopically, cabbage leaf seems to be well-tolerated.\nDermatologic\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that application of cabbage leaf wraps to knee joints for at least 2 hours daily for 4 weeks is generally well-tolerated. Of the 27 patients using cabbage leaf wraps in this study, one patient reported an itching and burning sensation during the application. This patient was later found to have shingles, which may explain the adverse event (93671). However, in another case, a patient applying fresh Savoy cabbage leaves on his knee to reduce joint pain reported pain and burning after 4 hours of use. Skin patch and prick tests did not indicate an allergic reaction, and the patient's lesion improved with wet dressings, topical antibiotics, and oral antibiotics (93675).\nless\nImmunologic\nTopically, cabbage may cause contact dermatitis (93675). Allergic reactions to cabbage-related vegetables are rare. However, anaphylactic reactions to broccoli and cauliflower have been reported. Because the surface proteins believed to cause allergic reactions to brocolli are also found in cabbage, some patients allergic to brocolli or other vegetables in the Brassicaceae family may also be allergic to cabbage (92516).\nless\nOther\nTopical application of cabbage leaves to the breasts has been reported to stain clothes and put off an unpleasant smell (6781, 6782).\nless",

Most research shows that applying cabbage leaves to engorged breasts reduces pain and hardness to the same degree as cold compresses in lactating females with breast engorgement.\nSeveral small clinical studies suggest that applying whole cabbage leaves to the engorged breasts of lactating females produces subjective relief similar to the use of chilled gel-packs (6781, 6784, 93677). Both chilled and room temperature cabbage leaves seem to provide the same relief (6782). Another small clinical study shows that whole cabbage leaves also seem to improve breast pain and hardness when compared with general nursing care (93673). When compared with hot and cold compresses, one small clinical study found that using chilled cabbage leaves reduces postnatal breast engorgement to a similar degree, but is not as effective for reducing pain (101966).\n\nThe preparation of cabbage leaves for this purpose sometimes includes stripping out the large vein of the cabbage leaf and cutting a hole for the nipple. Cabbage leaves are rinsed and chilled. The chilled cabbage leaf is worn inside the bra or as a compress under a cool towel. This procedure is typically repeated 1-4 times daily for 1-3 days (6781, 6784, 93673, 93677, 101966).\n\nA cabbage leaf extract applied as a cream has also been tried. The cabbage leaf extract cream seems to provide subjective relief when compared to baseline, but it does not provide superior relief when compared with a placebo cream (6783).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBladder cancer. It is unclear if consuming cabbage is effective for the prevention of bladder cancer.\nObservational research has found that eating about 1.75 cups of cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage or broccoli is associated with a 30% reduced risk of bladder cancer in men and women (14864).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if consuming cabbage is effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer.\nObservational research has found that consuming large amounts of cabbage and other Brassica vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and cauliflower is associated with a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer (6792).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if consuming cabbage is effective for the prevention of gastric cancer.\nObservational research has found that consuming large amounts of cabbage and other Brassica vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and cauliflower is associated with a lower risk of developing stomach cancer (6792).\nless\nGastritis. Although there has been interest in using oral cabbage for gastritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cabbage for this purpose.\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral cabbage is beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nA small clinical study in Japanese adults with hyperlipidemia shows that adding broccoli and cabbage to a beverage consisting of fruits and vegetables for 3-9 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 8.5% when compared to baseline. The reduction in LDL cholesterol was significant when compared with the same beverage without broccoli and cabbage added (25423).\nless\nKnee pain. It is unclear if topical cabbage is beneficial in patients with knee pain.\nA small clinical study in males with an acute mild to moderate traumatic knee ligament injury shows that use of crushed fresh cabbage leaf and cooling dressing wraps improves recovery over the first 24 hours of use by a moderate amount when compared with the cooling dressing alone. Normal fluid release occurred in 67% to 80% of patients using crushed cabbage leaf compared with 47% to 50% of those given the cooling dressing alone (101969).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if consuming cabbage is effective for the prevention of lung cancer.\nObservational research has found that consuming large amounts of cabbage and other Brassica vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and cauliflower is associated with a lower risk of developing lung cancer (6792).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Small clinical studies suggest that topical cabbage leaf modestly improves pain and other symptoms in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.\nA small clinical study in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee shows that applying cabbage leaf wraps to the knees for at least 2 hours daily for 4 weeks decreases pain by around 12 points on a 100 mm visual analog scale when compared with usual care. The analgesic effect of cabbage leaf wraps in these patients appears to be similar to treatment with topical gel containing the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac 10 mg/gram (93671). Another small, open-label clinical study in patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the knee shows that applying cabbage leaf wraps to the knees for 1 hour daily for 4 weeks reduces knee pain and improves symptom severity when compared with diclofenac gel applied four times daily. Improvements in pain and overall symptoms were similar between cabbage leaf and the use of cooling gel pads (110558). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding.\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if consuming cabbage is effective for the prevention of pancreatic cancer.\nObservational research in elderly and middle-aged individuals has found that consuming one or more servings of cabbage per week is associated with a 38% lower risk of developing pancreatic cancer when compared with those who do not eat cabbage (25422).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral cabbage for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cabbage for this purpose.\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if consuming cabbage is effective for the prevention of prostate cancer.\nSome observational research has found that consuming higher amounts of cabbage and other Brassica vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and cauliflower is not associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer (25417, 25419). However, other observational studies have found that consuming higher amounts of cabbage and other Brassica vegetables is associated with a lower risk of developing prostate cancer (25418, 25420, 25421).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate cabbage for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of cabbage is the leaf. Cabbage, like other dark leafy vegetables, contains high amounts of vitamin K1 (11285). Cabbage contains modest amounts of calcium, vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin E, and several B vitamins. Cabbage also contains other active constituents including flavones, flavonols, isoflavones, anthocyanins, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and goitrin (7162, 93674, 93679).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research suggests that cabbage has anti-inflammatory activity, with Chinese cabbage, Savoy cabbage, and green cabbage having much higher anti-inflammatory activity compared to red cabbage (93676).\nAntioxidant effects\nCabbage seems to have antioxidant effects (5234, 6791, 93676, 93679). Fresh cabbage may have higher antioxidant capacity than fermented cabbage, possibly due to increased anthocyanin bioavailability in fresh cabbage (93679). Red cabbage contains the highest concentration of total antioxidants, followed by Savoy cabbage, Chinese cabbage, and green cabbage (93676).\nAntithyroid effects\nCabbage constituents seem to have antithyroid effects, possibly by inhibiting iodine uptake (7162).\nChemopreventive effects\nThere is some interest in cabbage for breast cancer prevention because it contains constituents called glucosinolates, such as indole-3-carbinol. Indole-3-carbinol is released from cabbage when it is chewed and is thought to change how estrogen is metabolized. Estrogen can be converted to either 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone or 2-alpha-hydroxyestrone. The 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone metabolite is thought to have a role in developing cancer. The 2-alpha-hydroxyestrone seems to protect against breast cancer. Indole-3-carbinol induces cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and 1A2 (CYP1A2), which shifts metabolism away from 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone in favor of 2-alpha-hydroxyestrone (7175, 7176, 7177, 7179, 7180, 7181, 7182, 7187). This means that indole-3-carbinol might boost levels of a protective estrogen metabolite and decrease levels of a harmful one. Indole-3-carbinol and other glucosinolates, including S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide, might also have anticarcinogenic properties. These constituents seem to inhibit the enzymatic transformation of pro-mutagens (6790). The chemopreventive effects of cabbage constituents might also be explained by modulation of CYP19, CYP1A, and CYP11B1 and induction of the detoxifying enzymes glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO). These effects, reported in vitro, suggest that cabbage juices and cabbage constituents inhibit aromatase expression and protect against the carcinogenic effects of estrogen metabolites (93672, 93678, 93680). Additionally, N-acetyl compounds, which result from metabolism of isothiocyanates from cabbage, are believed to have anti-cancer effects and help reduce the risk of bladder cancer (14864).\nWound healing effects\nCabbage has been used in human research to aid in the healing of a knee injury. In animal models, topical cabbage has resulted in increased wound healing, including stimulated collagen maturation, the formation of scar tissue, and increased mechanical resistance of new tissue (101969)."

However, this effect is mild in comparison with caffeine, which causes a similar effect in a much smaller dose of 10 mg/kg (18042).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with caffeic acid.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral ingestion, approximately 95% of caffeic acid is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract compared to 33% with chlorogenic acid (18031). Upon ingestion of chlorogenic acid from coffee, caffeic acid and the related compounds, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid, appeared in plasma within 1-2 hours (18040). Following ingestion of red wine, peak concentration of caffeic acid was reached in approximately 60 minutes (18034). It's thought that caffeic acid is absorbed passively in the stomach and through an active transport mechanism in the small intestine (18031). Caffeic acid and derivatives from intestinal bacteria are also absorbed from the colon (18032, 104615).\nDistribution\nIn humans, caffeic acid has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that it can cross the blood brain barrier (104615).\nMetabolism\nCaffeic acid undergoes methylation, sulphation, or glucuronidation (104615).\nExcretion\nApproximately 11% of caffeic acid is excreted in the urine (18031).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCaffeic acid is a phenolic compound in the hydroxycinnamic acid class. In foods, caffeic acid occurs primarily as an ester with quinic acid, called chlorogenic acid. Coffee is the primary dietary source of chlorogenic acid. Other sources include olives, apples, artichoke, berries, and pears (18031, 104616). For people who drink coffee, chlorogenic acid intake is typically 0.5-1 gram daily. Those who do not drink coffee typically ingest less than 100 mg per day of chlorogenic acid (18031). Green coffee beans have a higher level of chlorogenic acid compared to regular, roasted coffee beans. Green coffee beans provide approximately 5-12 grams of chlorogenic acid per 100 grams of beans (17978). Red wine is also a significant source of caffeic acid. There is approximately 0.9 mg of caffeic acid per 100 mL of red wine (18034).\nAnti-cancer effects\nCaffeic acid is of interest in cancer prevention. In an animal model, caffeic acid has been shown to suppress growth of liver tumor cells, possibly through inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (18035). In vitro, caffeic acid significantly reduced proliferation of cervical cancer cells through apoptosis (18038). In addition, caffeic acid has anti-angiogenesis, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in animal models (18031, 18033, 18036, 18039, 104616).\nAnti-viral effects\nThere is interest in caffeic acid for its antiviral effects. In vitro, caffeic acid appears to inhibit replication of the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) (18037).\nAthletic performance effects\nThere is interest in caffeic acid for improving exercise or athletic performance. In an animal model, caffeic acid increased exercise tolerance, reduced lactate levels, and reduced markers of liver oxidation (18036).\nStimulant effects\nIn animal models, ingestion of caffeic acid 200 mg/kg significantly increased sleep latency. However, this effect is mild in comparison with caffeine, which causes a similar effect in a much smaller dose of 10 mg/kg (18042). Caffeic acid also seems to significantly increase locomotor activity in animal models (18043).\nVasodilatory effects\nCaffeic acid might modestly increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. These enzymes are involved in the production of nitric oxide and vasodilation (18045, 18046)."

    "Caffeine": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Caffeine is a naturally occurring bitter-tasting methylxanthine compound found in the leaves, seeds, or fruits of more than 60 plants (37842, 37852, 37869, 37876, 37962, 37976, 37993, 37997, 37999, 38029)(38073, 38082, 38087, 38099, 114673). Caffeine is a psychoactive chemical and is commonly used as a euphoriant and stimulant. Historically, it has been used orally as a diuretic and topically for dermatitis.\n\nWARNINGS\n\nCaffeine consumption is permitted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) within limits. Urine concentrations over 15 mcg/mL are prohibited during competition. It takes 600-800 mg of caffeine, or about 6-8 cups of coffee, consumed 2-3 hours before competition for most people to achieve this urine concentration (16273, 114673). The International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) delisted caffeine in 2004, although the use of caffeine is still monitored by WADA (114673).\n\nSome caffeine products for supplement use are highly concentrated or pure formulations. In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that such formulations are unlawful when sold directly to consumers in bulk quantities. These products are considered to be a health concern because they have a high risk of being mistakenly used in excessive and potentially dangerous doses. At least two deaths have been associated with the use of highly concentrated and pure caffeine (95700).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally, parenterally, or rectally and appropriately. Caffeine has Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status in the US (4912, 98806). Caffeine is also an FDA-approved product and a component of several over-the-counter and prescription products (4912, 11832). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, doses of caffeine up to 400 mg daily are not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults (11733, 98806). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults (98806). This amount of caffeine is similar to the amount of caffeine found in approximately 4 cups of coffee. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine from caffeine-containing natural ingredients such as coffee or green tea does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally, long-term or in high doses (91063). Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, psychological dependence, and other adverse effects (3719). Acute use of high doses, typically above 400 mg daily, has been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmia and sleep disturbances (11832). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine from caffeine-containing natural ingredients such as coffee or green tea does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nLIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in very high doses. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg/kg). Serious toxicity can occur at lower doses depending on variables in caffeine sensitivity such as smoking, age, or prior caffeine use (11832, 95700, 97454, 104573). Caffeine products sold to consumers in highly concentrated or pure formulations are considered to a serious health concern because these products have a risk of being used in very high doses. Concentrated liquid caffeine can contain about 2 grams of caffeine in a half cup. Powdered pure caffeine can contain about 3.2 grams of caffeine in one teaspoon. Powdered pure caffeine can be fatal in adults when used in doses of 2 tablespoons or less. As of 2018, these products are considered by the FDA to be unlawful when sold to consumers in bulk quantities (95700).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally or intravenously and appropriately in neonates under the guidance of a healthcare professional (6371, 38340, 38344, 91084, 91087, 97452). ...when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods and beverages in children and adolescents (4912, 11833, 36555). Daily intake of caffeine in doses of less than 2.5 mg/kg daily are not associated with significant adverse effects in children and adolescents (11733, 98806). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine from caffeine-containing natural ingredients such as coffee or green tea does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Intakes of caffeine should be monitored during pregnancy. Caffeine crosses the human placenta, but is not considered a teratogen (38048, 38252, 91032). Fetal blood and tissue levels are similar to maternal concentrations (4260). The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects (2708, 2709, 2710, 2711, 9606, 16014, 16015, 98806, 108814). In some studies consuming amounts over 200 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage (16014, 37960). This increased risk seems to occur in those with genotypes that confer a slow rate of caffeine metabolism (98806). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, up to 300 mg daily can be consumed during pregnancy without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations (11733, 98806). However, observational research in a Norwegian cohort found that caffeine consumption is associated with a 16% increased odds of the baby being born small for gestational age when compared with no consumption (100369, 103707). The same Norwegian cohort found that low to moderate caffeine consumption during pregnancy is not associated with changes in neurodevelopment in children up to 8 years of age (103699). Advise patients to keep caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily during pregnancy. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 3 cups of coffee or tea.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in amounts over 300 mg daily. Caffeine crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels (4260, 98806). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 300 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage in some studies (16014, 98806). Advise patients to keep caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily during pregnancy. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 3 cups of coffee or tea. Additionally, high doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants (9891). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight (2709, 2711, 91033, 91048, 95949). In a cohort of mother/infant pairs with a median maternal plasma caffeine level of 168.5 ng/mL (range 29.5-650.5 ng/mL) during pregnancy, birth weights and lengths were lower in the 4th quartile of caffeine intake compared with the 1st. By age 7, heights and weights were lower by 1.5 cm and 1.1 kg respectively. In another cohort of mother/infant pairs with higher maternal pregnancy plasma caffeine levels, median 625.5 ng/mL (range 86.2 to 1994.7 ng/mL), heights at age 8 were 2.2 cm lower, but there was no difference in weights (109846).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Caffeine intake should be closely monitored while breast-feeding. During lactation, breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of serum concentrations and caffeine peaks in breastmilk approximately 1-2 hours after consumption (23590).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Caffeine is excreted slowly in infants and may accumulate. Caffeine can cause sleep disturbances, irritability, and increased bowel activity in breast-fed infants exposed to caffeine (2708, 6026).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nCaffeine in moderate doses is typically well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Anxiety, dependence with chronic use, diarrhea, diuresis, gastric irritation, headache, insomnia, muscular tremors, nausea, and restlessness.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Stroke has been reported rarely.\nCardiovascular\nCaffeine can temporarily increase blood pressure. Usually, blood pressure increases 30 minutes after ingestion, peaks in 1-2 hours, and remains elevated for over 4 hours (36539, 37732, 37989, 38000, 38300).\n\nAlthough acute administration of caffeine can cause increased blood pressure, regular consumption does not seem to increase either blood pressure or pulse, even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722, 38335). However, the form of caffeine may play a role in blood pressure increase after a more sustained caffeine use. In a pooled analysis of clinical trials, coffee intake was not associated with an increase in blood pressure, while ingesting caffeine 410 mg daily for at least 7 days modestly increased blood pressure by an average of 4.16/2.41 mmHg (37657). Another meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking caffeine increases systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 2 mmHg when compared with control. Preliminary subgroup analyses suggest that caffeine may increase blood pressure more in males or at doses over 400 mg (112738).\n\nWhen used prior to intensive exercise, caffeine can increase systolic blood pressure by 7-8 mmHg (38308). The blood pressure-raising effects of caffeine are greater during stress (36479, 38334) and after caffeine-abstinence of at least 24 hours (38241).\n\nEpidemiological research suggests there is no association of caffeine consumption with incidence of hypertension (38190). Habitual coffee consumption also doesn't seem to be related to hypertension, but habitual consumption of sugared or diet cola is associated with development of hypertension (13739).\n\nEpidemiological research has found that regular caffeine intake of up to 400 mg daily is not associated with increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (38018, 38076, 91028, 91034, 97451, 97453, 103708), atherosclerosis (38033), cardiac ectopy (91127), stroke (37804), ventricular arrhythmia (95948, 97453), and cardiovascular disease in general (37805, 98806). One clinical trial shows that in adults with diagnosed heart failure, consumption of 500 mg of coffee does not result in an increased risk for arrhythmia during exercise (95950). However, caffeine intake may pose a greater cardiovascular risk to subjects that are not regular users of caffeine. For example, in one population study, caffeinated coffee consumption was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in subjects that don't regularly drink coffee (38102). In a population study in Japanese subjects, caffeine-containing medication use was modestly associated with hemorrhagic stroke in adults that do not consume caffeine regularly (91059).\n\nThe most common side effect of caffeine in neonates receiving caffeine for apnea is tachycardia (98807, 114658).\nless\nDermatologic\nThere are several case reports of urticaria after caffeine ingestion (36546, 36448, 36475).\nless\nEndocrine\nSome evidence shows caffeine is associated with fibrocystic breast disease or breast cancer in females; however, this is controversial since findings are conflicting (8043, 108806). Restricting caffeine in females with fibrocystic breast conditions doesn't seem to affect breast nodularity, swelling, or pain (8996). A population analysis of the Women's Health Initiative observational study has found no association between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors (108806). Also, a dose-response analysis of 2 low-quality observational studies has found that high consumption of caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (108807).\n\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that an increase consumption of caffeine results in increased insulin resistance (91023).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nGastrointestinal upset, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fecal incontinence may occur with caffeine intake (36466, 37755, 37806, 37789, 37830, 38138, 38136, 38223, 95956, 95963). Also, caffeine may cause feeding intolerance and gastrointestinal irritation in infants (6023). Perioperative caffeine during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery seems to increase the rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting (97451). Caffeine and coffee consumption have been associated with an increase in the incidence of heartburn (37545, 37575, 38251, 38259, 38267) and gastrointestinal esophageal reflux disease (GERD) (38329, 37633, 37631, 37603).\nless\nGenitourinary\nCaffeine, a known diuretic, may increase voiding, give a sense of urgency, and irritate the bladder (37874, 37961, 104580). In men with lower urinary tract symptoms, caffeine intake increased the risk of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (38115). Excessive caffeine consumption may worsen premenstrual syndrome. Consumption of up to 10 cups of caffeinated drinks daily was associated with increased severity of premenstrual syndrome (38177). Finally, population research shows that exposure to caffeine was not associated with an increased risk of endometriosis (91035).\nless\nImmunologic\nCaffeine can cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals, although true IgE-mediated caffeine allergy seems to be relatively rare (11315).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nCaffeine can induce or exacerbate muscular tremors (38136, 37673, 38161). There has also been a report of severe rhabdomyolysis in a healthy 40-year-old patient who consumed an energy drink containing 400 mg of caffeine (4 mg/kg) and then participated in strenuous weightlifting exercise (108818).\n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the relationship between caffeine use and the risk for osteoporosis is contradictory. Caffeine can release calcium from storage sites and increase its urinary excretion (2669, 10202, 11317, 111489). Females with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to be at an increased risk for the detrimental effect of caffeine on bone mass (2669). However, moderate caffeine intake, less than 300 mg daily, does not seem to significantly increase osteoporosis risk in most postmenopausal adults with normal calcium intake (2669, 6025, 10202, 11317). Premature infants treated with intravenous caffeine for apnea of prematurity, have a lower bone mineral content compared with infants who are not treated with caffeine, especially when treatment extends beyond 14 days (111489).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nCaffeine can cause headaches, anxiety, jitteriness, restlessness, and nervousness (36466, 37694, 37755, 37806, 37865, 37830, 37889, 38223, 95952). In adolescents, there is an inverse correlation between the consumption of caffeine and various measurements of cognitive function (104579). Insomnia is a frequent adverse effect in children (10755). Caffeine may result in insomnia and sleep disturbances in adults as well (36445, 36483, 36512, 36531, 37598, 37795, 37819, 37862, 37864, 37890)(37968, 37971, 38091, 38242, 91022, 92952). Additionally, caffeine may exacerbate sleep disturbances in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (10204). Combining ephedra with caffeine can increase the risk of adverse effects. Jitteriness, hypertension, seizures, temporary loss of consciousness, and hospitalization requiring life support has been associated with the combined use of ephedra and caffeine (2729). Finally, epidemiological research suggests that consuming more than 190 mg of caffeine daily is associated with an earlier onset of Huntington disease by 3.6 years (91078).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nIn individuals with glaucoma, coffee consumption and caffeine intake has been found to increase intraocular pressure (8540, 36464, 36465, 37670). The magnitude of this effect seems to depend on individual tolerance to caffeine. Some research in healthy young adults shows that caffeine increases intraocular pressure to a greater degree in low-consumers of caffeine (i.e., 1 cup of coffee or less daily) when compared to high-consumers (i.e., those consuming 2 cups of coffee or more daily) (100371). The peak increase of intraocular pressure seems to occur at about 1.5 hours after caffeine ingestion, and there is no notable effect 4 hours after ingestion (36462, 100371).\nless\nOncologic\nMost human studies which have examined caffeine or methylxanthine intake have found that they do not play a role in the development of various cancers, including breast, ovarian, brain, colon, rectal, or bladder cancer (37641, 37737, 37775, 37900, 38050, 38169, 38220, 91054, 91076, 108806).\nless\nPsychiatric\nCaffeine may lead to habituation and physical dependence (36355, 36453, 36512, 36599), with amounts as low as 100 mg daily (36355, 36453). An estimated 9% to 30% of caffeine consumers could be considered addicted to caffeine (36355). Higher doses of caffeine have caused nervousness, agitation, anxiety, irritability, delirium, depression, sleep disturbances, impaired attention, manic behavior, psychosis and panic attacks (36505, 37717, 37818, 37839, 37857, 37982, 38004, 38017, 38028, 38072)(38079, 38138, 38306, 38325, 38331, 38332, 97464). Similar symptoms have been reported in a caffeine-naïve individual experiencing fatigue and dehydration after a dose of only 200 mg, with resolution of symptoms occurring within 2 hours (95952).\n\nWithdrawal: The existence or clinical importance of caffeine withdrawal is controversial. Some researchers think that if it exists, it appears to be of little clinical significance (11839). Headache is the most common symptom, due to cerebral vasodilation and increased blood flow (37769, 37991, 37998). Other researchers suggest symptoms such as tiredness and fatigue, decreased energy, alertness and attentiveness, drowsiness, decreased contentedness, depressed mood, difficulty concentration, irritability, and lack of clear-headedness are typical of caffeine withdrawal (13738). Withdrawal symptoms typically occur 12-24 hours after the last dose of caffeine and peak around 48 hours (37769, 36600). Symptoms may persist for 2-9 days. Withdrawal symptoms such as delirium, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea, nervousness, restlessness, anxiety, muscle tension, muscle pains, and flushed face have been described. However, these symptoms may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects. Clinically significant symptoms caused by caffeine withdrawal may be uncommon (2723, 11839). In a case report, caffeine consumption of 560 mg daily was associated with increased suicidality (91082).\nless\nRenal\nData on the relationship between caffeine intake and kidney stones are conflicting. Some clinical research shows that caffeine consumption may increase the risk of stone formation (37634, 111498), while other research shows a reduced risk with increasing caffeine intakes (111498). A meta-analysis of 7 studies found that overall, there is an inverse relationship, with a 32% decrease in the risk of kidney stones between the lowest and highest daily intakes of caffeine (111498).\nless\nOther\nPeople with voice disorders, singers, and other voice professionals are often advised against the use of caffeine; however, this recommendation has been based on anecdotal evidence. One small exploratory study suggests that caffeine ingestion may adversely affect subjective voice quality, although there appears to be significant intra-individual variability. Further study is necessary to confirm these preliminary findings (2724).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nMigraine headache. Oral caffeine in combination with acetaminophen, aspirin, and/or sumatriptan is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating migraine headache.\nTaking caffeine 100-260 mg orally in combination with acetaminophen 500-2000 mg, aspirin 500 mg, and/or sumatriptan 50-100 mg is effective for treating migraine headache (2715, 2716, 2717, 37614, 37626, 37816, 91068). Some evidence shows that caffeine in combination with aspirin and acetaminophen may be more effective than sumatriptan in treating a migraine attack (37666). However, taking caffeine 200 mg plus ergotamine seems to be less effective than sumatriptan or calcium carbasalate plus metoclopramide (37685, 38312). Caffeine is an FDA-approved product for use with analgesics for the treatment of migraine.\nless\nNeonatal apnea. Oral or intravenous caffeine citrate is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the short-term treatment of neonatal apnea in very preterm infants.\nUsing caffeine orally or intravenously improves apnea of prematurity in very preterm infants and reduces the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, invasive mechanical ventilation, and neurodevelopmental impairment (6023, 6371, 37857, 37906, 38124, 38344, 98807, 100364, 114658). The dosage approved in the FDA labeling is a single loading dose of caffeine citrate 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg caffeine base), followed by 5 mg/kg of caffeine citrate (2.5 mg/kg caffeine base) every 24 hours for maintenance.\n\nClinical research shows that caffeine citrate dose-dependently reduces the number of apnea episodes by at least 50% over 7-10 days of treatment (6371). Most research suggests that doses above 10 mg/kg daily reduce the risk of apnea, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and problematic extubation when compared with doses below 10 mg/kg/day (98807, 100364, 114658). Additional clinical research shows that reinitiating caffeine treatment after termination of the original caffeine regimen, and continuing until 40 weeks postmenstrual age, reduces the incidence of intermittent hypoxia in premature infants by 46% when compared to standard care (91073). At 18-21 months of age, a history of neonatal caffeine treatment reduces the risk of long-term complications of apnea of prematurity, such as cerebral palsy or cognitive delay (37722, 38340). At 11 years of age, individuals born prematurely and treated with caffeine have improved visuomotor, visuoperceptual, and visuospatial abilities when compared to those who received placebo (97452). At 6-11 years of age, these individuals may also have a reduced risk of motor impairment (114658).\n\nData on the prophylactic use of caffeine in very low birth-weight infants (less than 1500 grams and 32 weeks' gestation) are conflicting. In a meta-analysis of 11 studies, 5 show a reduced risk of apnea of prematurity, oxygen therapy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and retinopathy of prematurity, and a reduced duration of mechanical ventilation (111491). However, other studies do not show any benefit (38125, 111491). A study of infants born at 34-36 weeks' gestation shows that caffeine citrate, 10 or 20 mg/kg orally daily, reduces the number of intermittent hypoxemia episodes per hour by 61% and 67% respectively, when compared with placebo (111493).\n\nCaffeine and aminophylline have similar effectiveness for management of apnea, bradycardia, and hypoxemia, but caffeine has a wider range of safe plasma levels and lower rates of tachycardia and feeding intolerance (111492).\nless\nPostoperative headache. Oral or intravenous caffeine is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for preventing headache in postoperative patients who regularly consume caffeinated products.\nClinical research shows that using caffeine is effective for preventing postoperative headache in patients who regularly consume caffeinated products. Intravenous caffeine does not seem to be effective in non-regular caffeine consumers. Studied doses have included 200 mg intravenously or oral doses calculated based on average daily consumption (2725, 2726). Caffeine is an FDA-approved product for preventing headache in postoperative patients who regularly consume caffeinated products.\nless\nTension headache. Oral caffeine in combination with analgesics is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating tension headache.\nTaking caffeine orally in combination with analgesics is effective for treating simple tension headache. Taking caffeine 100 mg alone is more effective at reducing tension headache pain when compared with placebo, but less effective than the combination of caffeine and analgesics. Caffeine 130 mg has been used with acetaminophen 1000 mg or with acetaminophen 500 mg and aspirin 500 mg. Caffeine 50 mg has been used with acetylsalicylic acid 250 mg and acetaminophen 200 mg (2718, 11832, 37668, 37773).\nless\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Oral caffeine taken as a single dose of at least 2-3 mg/kg can modestly improve endurance, muscle strength, power output, and overall athletic performance when taken prior to certain forms of athletic activity or exercise. However, the magnitude and duration of effect is variable and may be dependent on the form and dose of caffeine, as well as various individual- and activity-specific factors. Caffeine intake in excess of 800 mg daily can result in blood levels greater than those allowed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.\nClinical research and meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking caffeine 2-10 mg/kg modestly improves work produced, aerobic endurance, muscle strength and endurance, power output, and overall athletic performance (10203, 11832, 37648, 37894, 38054, 38063, 95955, 100362, 100365, 100371)(103701, 103703, 108798, 111250, 114655, 114657, 114661, 114673). According to the International Society of Sports Nutrition, the most consistent and measurable effects are seen in aerobic endurance; the minimal effective dose for any form of exercise is unclear, but benefits have been most consistent at doses of 3-6 mg/kg (114673). Meta-analyses of studies using caffeine 3-9 mg/kg as a single dose prior to endurance time trials report variability in results. Sports studied included running, rowing, cycling, swimming, and Nordic skiing, and included both recreational and trained athletes. Overall there was a small positive effect on time to exhaustion, endurance performance, and mean power output, and a decrease in the time needed to complete the trials when compared with placebo (98808, 111497, 114655). One meta-analysis of studies that evaluated cycling time trial performance found that doses of 4-6 mg/kg, but not doses of 1-3 mg/kg, improved performance (114655). A separate meta-analysis of 14 clinical studies shows that taking caffeine 2-11 mg/kg approximately 45-60 minutes before exercise improves muscle strength and endurance in the upper and lower body when compared with placebo. However, a sub-group analysis shows that muscle strength only improves with caffeine doses of at least 6 mg/kg (114657). Another meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that the benefit of caffeine on athletic performance seems to increase with increased duration of activity. This suggests that caffeine can improve physical endurance during athletic activities (100371). In these trials, caffeine is typically provided as a single dose 30-150 minutes prior to testing (98808), although one study suggests that taking caffeine 60 minutes prior to peak activity has the most consistent ergogenic benefits (104577).\n\nCaffeine might improve performance in some athletic activities but not others. Some research shows that caffeine does not improve performance during athletic activities requiring a high amount of exertion over a short period of time. Such activities include sprinting and lifting (11832, 37564, 37758, 37837, 37841, 37890, 38319, 95963, 97459, 112740). However, it is possible that the negative lifting studies were underpowered. Ballistic exercise, such as jumping or throwing, requires rapid increases in velocity, force, and muscle activation. A meta-analysis of 10 studies shows that caffeine in a range of doses (mean: 3 mg/kg) has a significant ergogenic effect on throwing performance and velocity (111488). A meta-analysis of small studies shows that caffeine modestly improves bench press repetitions and maximum strength, but not perceived exertion, when compared with placebo. Caffeine also tends to improve these parameters for leg presses, but the improvement does not reach significance when compared with placebo (103701). A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in female team-sport athletes shows that caffeine improves specific team-sport skills but has no effect on perceived exertion or agility tests performed after exertion (108799). Conversely, a small individual clinical study shows that taking caffeine 6.5 mg/kg 60 minutes before strength training decreases perceived exertion while increasing the number of repetitions of both upper and lower limb exercises by 17% to 33% over placebo (104581).\n\nSome clinical research also shows that taking caffeine can decrease subjective feelings of exertion and fatigue during exercise such as fencing and cycling (17618, 37656, 91026, 91058, 91062). Although some other clinical studies show that caffeine does not affect perceived exertion, caffeine does seem to improve performance and cause small increases in the amount of physical work done when compared with placebo in various athletes, including cyclists, runners, basketball players, and golfers (37702, 37860, 37872, 38031, 38119, 38320, 91037, 91077, 97457, 97459)(104580, 108800, 108804). These effects do not seem to be dependent upon the dose of caffeine (97459), although some research shows that the timing of caffeine intake and exercise may alter overall benefit, with a greater effect seen in the morning compared to the evening (97457, 104580).\n\nMost research has investigated the acute effects of a single dose of caffeine. The evidence is mixed as to whether chronic intake of caffeine could induce tolerance and reduce any acute ergogenic benefits (114673). One study shows that the consistent consumption of caffeine 3 mg/kg daily for 28 days eliminates the acute benefits of caffeine in work produced when compared with placebo, suggesting the development of tolerance (95955). However, chronic use of caffeine at a dose of 6 mg/kg for 4 days does not seem to induce tolerance to an acute dose of caffeine 6 mg/kg taken 60 minutes prior to a cycling time trial in males who are moderate to high users of caffeine (104576). Similarly, a small clinical study in trained individuals shows that acute supplementation with oral caffeine 6 mg/kg about 1 hour prior to performance improves strength and endurance when compared with placebo or control, regardless of habitual caffeine consumption (108804). Differences may be due to the type of exercise, the acute dose of caffeine, the length of the chronic intake period, and/or the normal caffeine intake of the athlete.\n\nMost studies suggest that there is significant inter-individual variability in response to caffeine for improvement of athletic performance (100365). These differences might be due, at least in part, to genotype (100370, 114673), although research is conflicting. Caffeine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme. One small clinical trial in resistance-trained males shows that taking caffeine 6 mg/kg improves resistance exercise performance in those homozygous for the CYP1A2 rs762551 polymorphism (AA) when compared with those without or heterozygous for that polymorphism (CC or A/C, respectively) (100370). However, another clinical study in trained male athletes shows that taking oral caffeine 4 mg/kg about 30 minutes prior to performance decreases handgrip strength by about 13% in individuals with the CC genotype when compared with placebo, but not in those with the AA or A/C genotypes. No groups experienced an improvement in vertical jump performance (108803). Another small clinical study suggests that CYP1A2 genotype does not affect exercise performance in athletes 60 minutes after taking caffeine 3 mg/kg. In addition, the ADORA2A genotype, which plays a role in caffeine sensitivity, does not seem to affect exercise performance benefits from caffeine (104578). However, these studies are small and used different performance protocols; further research is needed to clarify how these polymorphisms may impact the athletic performance benefits of caffeine (114673).\n\nLimited research has also evaluated the use of a caffeine mouth rinse, with mixed findings. Two very small clinical studies in healthy trained males shows that rinsing the mouth with 25 mL of water containing caffeine 85 or 300 mg for 5-10 seconds does not affect athletic performance or time to exhaustion while cycling when compared with placebo (103709, 108801). However, another small study in healthy Taekwondo athletes fasting for Ramadan suggests that using a mouth rinse containing caffeine 6 mg/kg, ten seconds prior to exertion, modestly reduces perceived exertion and modestly improves kick performance when compared with using a placebo rinse (103710). Similarly, another small clinical study in healthy, resistance-trained males shows that rinsing the mouth with 25 mL of a solution containing caffeine 3%, but not 1% or 2%, reduces perceived exertion and increases muscular endurance, but not strength, when compared with placebo. The mouth rinse was used for 5 seconds immediately prior to a strength test or once per minute for 2 minutes during a muscular endurance test (108802).\n\nPreliminary clinical research has also investigated the use of caffeine in combination with other ingredients, such as sodium bicarbonate or creatine. However these studies have not demonstrated clear benefits in athletic performance over taking caffeine alone (112740, 114673).\nless\nMental alertness. Oral caffeine increases mental alertness. However, it might not improve performance or accuracy to the same extent achieved through adequate sleep.\nConsumption of caffeinated beverages or caffeine supplements seems to prevent a decline in alertness and cognitive capacity when consumed throughout the day (4221, 4224, 36439, 37727, 37757, 37759, 38070, 38075, 38158, 91093)(91075). Caffeine appears to be especially effective in individuals that are not regular users (91074). Taking caffeine 100-600 mg can improve alertness and speed following prolonged sleep deprivation but usually does not affect mental performance or accuracy (10205, 37716, 37755, 37806, 37992, 38007, 38035, 38139, 91049, 91072)(103706, 112736). Drinking coffee containing caffeine 100 mg prior to a cognitive performance test improves reaction times in people with recent poor sleep quality, and in those with adequate sleep. However, the increase in vigilance occurring in the sleep-deprived people does not bring their performance up to the level seen with adequate sleep. Also, the number of errors made by sleep-deprived people seems to increase, suggesting that caffeine may have a detrimental effect on inhibitory control (98809).\n\nCaffeine also appears to reduce cognitive impairment caused by medications such as chlorpheniramine (91058).\n\nCombining caffeine with certain other supplements may improve mental performance. Taking caffeine 80 mg with taurine seems to provide a small improvement in mental performance (9899), although this effect is not observed in sleep deprived subjects (38154). Some clinical research shows that combining caffeine 40-75 mg with glucose 37.5 grams or L-theanine 97-100 mg improves mental performance better than placebo or either substance alone (13732, 37762, 37903, 38116); however, other clinical research shows no additional benefit from combining L-theanine and caffeine (91045).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Intravenous caffeine may reduce the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants.\nPopulation research has found that initiating caffeine treatment prior to the third day of life in premature infants is associated with a reduced risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared to later initiation of treatment with caffeine. Additionally, a meta-analysis of available clinical research shows that high-dose caffeine (40-80 mg/kg loading dose, 20 mg/kg daily maintenance) lowers the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia when compared with standard dosing (20 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 5-10 mg/kg daily maintenance). However, small sample sizes and high heterogeneity limit the validity of these findings (97462, 100364).\nless\nDiabetes. Dietary caffeine seems to be beneficial for the prevention of type 2 diabetes; it is unclear if it is beneficial for the prevention of gestational diabetes. Also, it is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\nTotal caffeine consumption from beverages such as coffee or tea is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This effect appears to be dose-dependent (11353, 14313, 37850, 37871, 91040, 100368). For example, an increase of 200 mg daily caffeine intake seems to be associated with a 14% decrease in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (91055). Additionally, in North American males, consuming caffeine 417 mg daily from coffee or tea is associated with a 20% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with those consuming less than 37 mg daily. North American females consuming at least 258 mg of caffeine daily from coffee or tea seem to have a 10% to 30% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with those consuming less than 140 mg daily (11353). Japanese adults who consume at least 416 mg of caffeine daily from beverages including coffee or green tea seem to have a 33% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who consume no more than 57 mg daily. The risk reduction appears to be more pronounced in Japanese females when compared with males (14313).\n\nIt is unclear if caffeine is beneficial in adults with diabetes. A few small studies show that caffeine consumption may further reduce insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, or those at risk for developing diabetes (13744, 37653, 37820).\n\nCaffeine consumption has also been evaluated during pregnancy. An observational study has found that self-reported consumption of beverages containing up to 100 mg of caffeine at 16-22 weeks' gestation is associated with a 47% lower risk of developing gestational diabetes when compared with no intake (108814).\n\nResearch regarding the effects of caffeine in patients with type 1 diabetes shows conflicting results. One study shows that taking caffeine 250 mg twice daily for 2 weeks can reduce the incidence of elevated blood sugar at night in patients with type 1 diabetes (37660). However, another study in patients with type 1 diabetes shows that taking caffeine 200 mg daily for 3 months may increase the ability to perceive hypoglycemic symptoms when compared with placebo, although overall glycemic control does not seem to be affected (6024). A small clinical crossover study evaluated caffeine for the prevention of exercise-induced hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes using ultra-long-acting insulin. This study shows that consuming a beverage containing caffeine 250 mg, glucose 10 grams, and aspartame 30 minutes before a moderate intensity cycling exercise does not reduce the risk of exercise-related hypoglycemia, alter the time to hypoglycemia, or increase peak plasma glucose levels during exercise when compared with taking glucose and aspartame (114662).\nless\nMemory. Oral caffeine seems to be beneficial for short-term memory recall in college students and extroverted personalities. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for introverted personalities or other populations.\nTaking a single dose of caffeine 65-200 mg orally daily seems to improve memory function in some individuals such as college students and people with extroverted personalities. A small study shows that taking caffeine does not improve memory function in individuals with introverted personalities (37845, 38071, 91080).\nless\nObesity. Oral caffeine, when taken in combination with ephedrine or as a component of green tea, seems to be beneficial for weight loss, short-term.\nTaking caffeine orally, in combination with ephedrine or as a component of green tea, seems to help reduce weight, short-term (695, 696, 1704, 8647, 16892, 37617, 37831). Caffeine 192 mg in combination with ephedra 20-90 mg per day for 6 months seems to cause a modest weight reduction (5.3 kg) in people with a body mass index (BMI) between 25-40 kg/m2. This combination, along with limiting fat intake to 30% of calories and moderate exercise, also seems to reduce body fat, decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, even in carefully screened and monitored otherwise healthy adults, caffeine/ephedra combinations can cause small changes in blood pressure and heart rate (8647). Preliminary clinical research also shows that taking 1000 mg of a proprietary combination product containing caffeine and multiple other ingredients (Prograde Metabolism) twice daily for 8 weeks in conjunction with dieting reduces body weight, fat mass, waist circumference, and hip circumference by 1.5%, 5%, 1.8%, and 1.3%, respectively, when compared with dieting alone (40802).\nless\nPain (acute). Oral caffeine, when taken in combination with acetaminophen, propyphenazone, ibuprofen, or other pain-relieving agents, seems to be beneficial for acute pain.\nClinical research shows that taking caffeine 50-130 mg in combination with acetaminophen, propyphenazone, ibuprofen, or other pain-relieving agents can reduce acute pain when compared with the effects of pain-relieving agents alone (37587, 37904, 38036, 38303, 91038). Adding ≥100 mg caffeine to treatment with acetaminophen or ibuprofen results in 5% to 10% more patients that achieve at least 50% of maximum pain relief for over 4 hours when compared to treatment with acetaminophen or ibuprofen alone (91038).\nless\nPostdural puncture headache. Oral or intravenous caffeine seem to be beneficial for preventing postdural puncture headache.\nUsing caffeine 300 mg orally or 500 mg in 1,000 mL normal saline intravenously seems to help treat and prevent postdural puncture headache (2727, 2728). Using a combination of ergotamine and caffeine seems to be less effective than gabapentin for treating this condition (38147). Lower doses of oral caffeine may not be beneficial. Clinical research shows that oral caffeine, 75-125 mg, does not decrease the risk of postdural headache (91022).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAtrial fibrillation. Oral caffeine does not seem to prevent atrial fibrillation after cardiopulmonary bypass. In addition, it might increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.\nIn adults undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, taking caffeine 400 mg every 8 hours for 6 doses does not seem to reduce the risk of developing atrial fibrillation during the first three post-operative days. This clinical study was stopped prior to the completion of recruitment after an interim analysis showed increased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and no effect on the incidence of atrial fibrillation (97451).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral caffeine does not seem to reduce symptoms of ADHD in children.\nMost research suggests caffeine does not significantly reduce ADHD symptoms in children when used at tolerable doses (10755, 10756, 10757, 10758, 10759, 10760). The use of caffeine in adolescents and adults with ADHD has not been studied.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral caffeine prevents cognitive decline with aging.\nPopulation research from a small cohort of elderly females shows that caffeine intake of more than 371 mg daily is associated with an attenuation in cognitive decline when compared to less than 30 mg daily. This is equivalent to the difference seen over a 7 year span of age. Caffeinated coffee consumption, but not caffeinated chocolate, tea, or cola, was associated with this attenuation in cognitive decline (91088).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for preventing dementia; the available research is conflicting.\nPopulation research from the UK Biobank has found that caffeine intake up to 400 mg daily is associated with a 24% to 34% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer disease when compared with lower intake. Conversely, population research from the Rush Memory and Aging Project in the US has found that caffeine intake of more than 100 mg daily is associated with a 41% increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease when compared with lower intake. However, when those with mild cognitive impairment at baseline or cases diagnosed within 2 years of follow-up are excluded, these findings become insignificant (108810).\nless\nAsthma. Oral caffeine seems to modestly improve airway function for up to 4 hours in patients with mild to moderate asthma. However, it is unclear if oral caffeine has a clinically significant effect on asthma symptoms or quality of life.\nTaking caffeine 9 mg/kg orally appears to modestly improve airway function for up to 4 hours in people with mild to moderate asthma (37907, 37915). However, more research is needed to determine the appropriate dose, whether any benefit is clinically significant, or whether tolerance occurs with chronic dosing.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral caffeine improves cognitive performance in trained athletes.\nA meta-analysis of small studies in trained adult athletes shows that consumption of a low to moderate amount of caffeine 15-60 minutes prior to exercise and during exercise improves attention performance, but not reaction time or inhibitory control, when compared with placebo (108797). The validity of these findings is limited by unclear reporting.\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for preventing dementia or improving behavior in patients with dementia.\nPopulation research from the Women's Health Initiative has found that caffeine intake of more than 175 mg daily is associated with a 26% reduced risk of developing probable dementia or global cognitive impairment when compared to less than 175 mg daily in postmenopausal adults 65-80 years of age (97458). Population research from the UK Biobank has found that caffeine intake up to 400 mg daily is associated with a 17% to 26% reduced risk for developing all-cause dementia when compared with lower intake. Conversely, population research from the Rush Memory and Aging Project in the US has found that caffeine intake of more than 100 mg daily is associated with a 35% increased risk of developing all-cause dementia when compared with lower intake. However, when those with mild cognitive impairment at baseline or cases diagnosed within 2 years of follow-up are excluded, these findings become insignificant (108810).\n\nCaffeine consumption has also been evaluated in patients with dementia. A cross-sectional study in patients with dementia in a care home has found that intake of 'normal' to 'high' amounts of caffeine are associated with reduced agitation and other behavioral symptoms when compared to 'low' intakes of caffeine (104574).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for depression prevention.\nSome population research found that caffeine intake is associated with an increased incidence of depressive symptoms in pediatric patients (37839, 38162). However, other population research found that caffeinated beverage intake is associated with a decreased incidence of depression in adults (37969, 38165, 91067, 100366).\nless\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) augmentation. Although there has been interest in using intravenous caffeine sodium benzoate to augment electroconvulsive therapy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of caffeine for this condition.\nExercise-induced hypoxemia. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for hypoxemia associated with exercise.\nPreliminary clinical research in athletes experiencing exercise-induced hypoxemia shows that taking caffeine 8 mg/kg can improve exercise ventilation, but not ventilatory response or oxygen saturation, when compared with placebo (37750).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for reducing muscle soreness during exercise.\nThere is conflicting clinical evidence as to whether caffeine can reduce exercise-induced muscle pain. Some evidence shows that taking caffeine 100 mg or 10 mg/kg can reduce muscle pain during exercise when compared with placebo (37622, 38146). However, the effect of lower doses is unclear. Some evidence shows that taking caffeine 5 mg/kg may reduce exercise-induced muscle pain when compared with placebo (37747, 91050), while other evidence suggests that taking caffeine 2-5 mg/kg does not affect muscle pain during exercise (38141).\nless\nGallbladder disease. It is unclear if increased dietary caffeine intake reduces the risk of developing gallstones.\nConsumption of caffeinated beverages that provide 400 mg or greater of caffeine per day is associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing symptomatic gallstone disease (3345, 8032). The effect seems to be dose-dependent; consumption of 800 mg caffeine per day has the greatest reduction in risk (3345).\nless\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if increased dietary caffeine reduces the risk for hepatitis C-associated severe liver inflammation, although it may reduce the risk of developing advanced fibrosis.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that regular consumption of caffeine at doses of at least 123 mg daily is associated with a 48% reduced risk of advanced liver fibrosis when compared to lower caffeine intake in patients with hepatitis C virus (95947). An individual population study also found that higher intake of caffeine from coffee is associated with reduced severity of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus. For these patients, the risk of advanced fibrosis is reduced by 14% for each 67 mg of caffeine (37896). However, caffeine intake does not appear to be associated with a reduced risk of moderate to severe liver inflammation in patients with hepatitis C (95947).\nless\nHypnic headache. It is unclear if oral caffeine reduces the pain associated with this rare condition.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that drinking a cup of coffee containing caffeine before bed or upon waking up may help alleviate pain associated with hypnic headaches (38078).\nless\nHypotension. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial in people with low blood pressure.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that consuming caffeinated beverages increase blood pressure in elderly people with postprandial hypotension (11834, 11835).\nless\nIntermittent claudication. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for intermittent claudication.\nTaking a single dose of caffeine 6 mg/kg orally seems to improve walking distance, muscular strength, and endurance in patients with intermittent claudication; however, balance seems to be reduced (38038).\nless\nLiver disease. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for liver disease prevention.\nPopulation research found that there is an inverse association between intake of coffee and the incidence of liver cirrhosis (37576, 37608). However, it is unclear if this effect of coffee is attributable to caffeine, since other caffeinated beverages do not show this effect.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS).\nA small crossover study in adults with MS shows that taking caffeine 200 mg daily for 12 weeks may modestly improve balance, functional mobility, and MS-related quality of life, but not walking function, when compared to a 2-week placebo run-in period. All patients were told to eliminate all other forms of caffeine from their diets; however, baseline caffeine intake was not recorded (114663). The validity of this study is limited by the small size and heterogeneous nature of the study population, which included patients with various forms of MS at varying levels of severity.\nless\nNarcolepsy. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for narcolepsy.\nA small clinical study in patients with narcolepsy shows that taking caffeine 200 mg daily in the morning for 1 week does not affect reaction time, but modestly reduces drowsiness, when compared with baseline (103698). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a statistical comparison between the treatment and placebo groups.\nless\nNeonatal resuscitation. It is unclear if oral caffeine improves the likelihood for successful extubation in preterm infants.\nPreliminary clinical research in extremely preterm infants requiring mechanical ventilation within the first 5 days of birth shows that early administration of caffeine, given as a loading dose of caffeine citrate 20 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg daily until extubation, does not reduce mortality or shorten time to first successful extubation when compared to giving a bolus dose of caffeine citrate 20 mg/kg just prior to extubation (97461).\nless\nNocturnal enuresis. Reducing caffeine intake might reduce the frequency of nocturnal enuresis episodes in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 6-15 years with primary nocturnal enuresis shows that limiting caffeine intake to less than 30 mg daily reduces the mean number of bedwetting episodes from 3.5 to 2.4 per week, when compared with no change in the group with intakes of 80-100 mg daily. The probability of bedwetting in the caffeine restricted group was about 14% lower than that in the control group (111495).\nless\nNonmelanoma skin cancer. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for nonmelanoma skin cancer prevention.\nA review of available population research shows that increased caffeine intake from any source is associated with a 14% reduction in the risk of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer. Consumption of caffeinated coffee, but not decaffeinated coffee, is associated with an 18% reduced risk (97465).\nless\nParkinson disease. Although consuming caffeinated beverages might reduce the risk of developing Parkinson disease, it is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for improving symptoms. Also, oral caffeine does not seem to prevent tardive dyskinesia.\nIt is unclear whether caffeine improves some symptoms of Parkinson disease, as results from clinical research are conflicting (91069, 95951, 95954, 103705). One clinical study in Parkinson disease patients with extreme daytime somnolence shows that taking caffeine 100 mg twice daily for 3 weeks and then 200 mg twice daily for 3 weeks results in modest improvements in rigidity and bradykinesia, but inconsistent improvements in drowsiness, when compared with placebo (91069). Other clinical research shows that caffeine 200 mg twice daily does not lead to improvements in motor severity, cognition, or somnolence after 6, 12, or 18 months when compared with placebo (95954). Furthermore, a large retrospective study has found that caffeine consumption of more than 300 mg daily for 18 months in conjunction with dopaminergic therapy does not slow the rate of Parkinson disease progression. This research also shows that a reported consumption of caffeine greater than 300 mg, in conjunction with creatine 10 grams daily for 18 months, may accelerate the rate of Parkinson disease progression (95951). The retrospective nature of this study limits the validity of these findings.\n\nCaffeine does not appear to be helpful for reducing the risk of tardive dyskinesia. A retrospective analysis has found no definitive difference in onset of tardive dyskinesia in Parkinson patients consuming more than 204 mg caffeine daily when compared with those consuming less than 68 mg daily (91090).\n\nDespite these mainly negative findings, large-scale epidemiological studies have found that people who consume caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and cola, have a decreased risk of Parkinson disease (37931, 91060, 91071, 103705). Males consuming 3-4 cups (28 oz) of caffeinated coffee per day, or 421-2716 mg total caffeine, seem to have the lowest risk of developing this condition. However, a lower risk is also associated with consumption of as little as 124-208 mg of caffeine (6022). In females, more moderate caffeinated coffee consumption, such as 1-3 cups per day, seems to be best (1238). Caffeine does not appear to provide additional protection from Parkinson disease in cigarette smokers (9236, 91060).\nless\nPostoperative ileus. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for improving bowel recovery following colorectal surgery. Research is conflicting and may vary depending on the type of procedure performed.\nA meta-analysis of two small clinical trials in adults undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal resection shows that taking caffeine 100-200 mg three times daily, starting on postoperative day 1, does not reduce the time to the first stool, time to first flatus, or length of hospital stay (LOS) when compared with placebo (112732). Another meta-analysis of 8 trials, including the 2 trials discussed previously, pooled 610 patients undergoing open and laparoscopic colorectal procedures. The analysis shows that caffeine taken three times daily, starting either on the day of surgery or on postoperative day 1, reduces LOS and the time to first bowel movement when compared with placebo, tea, or decaffeinated coffee. However, a sub-analysis of only laparoscopic procedures shows no difference in LOS between groups. These findings are limited by high heterogeneity, which appears to be due primarily to differences between open and laparoscopic procedures (114660).\nless\nPostoperative pain. It is unclear if intravenous caffeine is beneficial for reducing opioid consumption in adults undergoing surgery.\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing laparoscopic colorectal and gastrointestinal surgery shows that intravenous caffeine citrate 200 mg at the initiation of surgical closure has no effect on cumulative opioid consumption through postoperative day 3 when compared with placebo. In fact, post-hoc analysis with adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, history of anxiety or depression, and open surgical conversion suggests an increase in opioid consumption with administration of caffeine when compared with placebo (108809).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral caffeine intake affects the risk of gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia.\na meta-analysis of 10 observational studies including about 115,000 pregnant people did not find an association between the level of caffeine intake during pregnancy and the risk of developing gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia (111485).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial for stroke prevention.\nPopulation research has found that increased intake of either caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee is associated with a decreased risk of stroke in females (37804). However, it is not clear if the effect of coffee is attributable to the caffeine component.\nless\nTinnitus. It is unclear if oral caffeine is beneficial in patients with chronic tinnitus.\nA small clinical study in adults with chronic tinnitus shows that taking a single dose of caffeine 300 mg improves mood and quality of life at 1 hour when compared with baseline.

However, other research shows that caffeine does not seem to affect supplemental adenosine because high interstitial levels of adenosine overcome the antagonistic effects of caffeine (11771). It is recommended that methylxanthines and methylxanthine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770).

Human research has shown that taking caffeine 300 mg in three divided doses along with carbamazepine 200 mg reduces the bioavailability of carbamazepine by 32% and prolongs the plasma half-life of carbamazepine 2-fold in healthy individuals (23562).\nless\nCIMETIDINE (Tagamet)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, cimetidine might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nCimetidine decreases the rate of caffeine clearance by 31% to 42% (11736).\nless\nCLOZAPINE (Clozaril)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nCaffeine might increase the levels and adverse effects of clozapine and acutely exacerbate psychotic symptoms.\nCaffeine might increase the effects and toxicity of clozapine. Caffeine doses of 400-1000 mg per day inhibit clozapine metabolism (5051). Clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Although researchers speculate that caffeine might inhibit CYP1A2, there is no reliable evidence that caffeine affects CYP1A2. There is also speculation that genetic factors might make some patients more sensitive to an interaction between clozapine and caffeine (13741).

Until more is known, use with caution. Some research suggests that caffeine may impair postprandial glucose metabolism in people with diabetes and contribute to insulin resistance. The effect of caffeinated beverages and herbs has not been studied (12374, 12375). Caffeine may enhance the frequency and intensity of hypoglycemic warning symptoms in patients with type 1 diabetes. Theoretically, this may increase the ability of diabetic patients to detect and treat hypoglycemia early. However, it might also increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine; however, with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740). Caffeine has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose (8646, 114662).\nless\nDIARRHEA\nCaffeine, especially when taken in large amounts, might exacerbate diarrhea (100523). Use with caution in patients with diarrhea.\nless\nEPILEPSY\nCaffeine might induce seizures and decrease the efficacy of some anticonvulsant drugs. Avoid using caffeine in high doses. Low doses of caffeine should be used with caution. Some animal research indicates that high doses of caffeine can significantly reduce seizure threshold or induce seizures (23559, 23560, 23561). Furthermore, caffeine seems to decrease the activity of various anticonvulsant drugs, including carbamazepine, ethosuximide, felbamate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate (23558, 23559, 23560, 23561, 23562, 23563).

Increases are generally small and not clinically significant, being less than the normal diurnal variation in blood pressure (98806). Regular consumption of caffeine does not seem to increase blood pressure even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722, 38335). Caffeine consumption does not increase the risk of developing chronic hypertension (38190).\nless\nINCONTINENCE\nCaffeine acts as a diuretic. Use with caution in patients with urinary incontinence. Caffeine intake of more than 400 mg daily worsened detrusor instability (urge incontinency) in older females (36346). Increasing caffeine intake worsens symptoms of urinary incontinence, such as urinary frequency and urgency (36382).\nless\nIRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS)\nUse caffeine with caution in patients with IBS. Caffeine, especially when taken in large amounts, might exacerbate diarrhea and worsen symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS (100526).\nless\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nUse caffeine with caution in postmenopausal adults identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor. Otherwise, limit caffeine intake to less than 400 mg. Those with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to have an 8% higher risk for bone loss from caffeine and should use caffeine with caution (2669). For most people, although caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium, it usually remains within the normal range (98806). In some studies, higher caffeine intake is associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk (37554, 37949, 37956, 38145). However other population research shows that caffeine intake is not associated with decreased BMD (36351, 37756, 38295). Some sources suggest that caffeine consumption should be limited to less than 300 mg per day (approximately 2-3 cups of coffee), unless there is adequate calcium supplementation to compensate for calcium losses (2669, 10202, 11317). However, according to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, healthy adults with adequate calcium intake are not at increased risk for decreased BMD, osteoporosis, or fractures with daily caffeine intakes up to 400 mg (11733, 98806).\nless\nPARKINSON DISEASE\nThe combination of caffeine and creatine should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson disease. Intake of caffeine of more than 300 mg daily in conjunction with creatine 10 grams daily might worsen the progression of Parkinson disease (95951).\nless\nSCHIZOPHRENIA\nCaffeine consumption may exacerbate psychosis in schizophrenia. Use with caution. In a case report, a schizophrenic patient stable on biweekly flupenthixol decanoate 40 mg injections experienced paranoia, agitation, and delusion after beginning to consume 4 cans of coffee daily (600 mg daily caffeine or 8.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks (91066). Symptoms of psychosis resolved after discontinuation of coffee.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nDIPYRIDAMOLE THALLIUM IMAGING\nTaking caffeine might interfere with dipyridamole thallium imaging studies. Caffeine attenuates the characteristic cardiovascular responses to dipyridamole and has altered test results (11742).\nless\nFUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (fMRI)\nTaking caffeine might interfere with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests. Caffeine can increase the linearity of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal that is used in most fMRI studies (23587).\nless\nNEUROBLASTOMA TESTS\nTaking caffeine might cause false-positive diagnosis of neuroblastoma, when diagnosis is based on tests of urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) or catecholamine concentrations. Caffeine can increase urine catecholamine and VMA concentrations (15).\nless\nPHARMACOLOGICAL STRESS TESTS\nTaking caffeine might interfere with the diagnostic accuracy of pharmacological stress tests. Caffeine is a competitive antagonist for adenosine receptors and as a result may inhibit coronary vasodilation and thus compromise detection of ischemia (11771, 37784, 114659). It is recommended that caffeine and caffeine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, caffeine appears more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine (Adenocard) stress testing (11771). The interaction between caffeine and dipyridamole is unlikely to be significant in stress testing if the heart rate increase is greater than 5% after dipyridamole infusion (11772). Caffeine in doses of 80 mg or less also do not appear to meaningfully interfere with stress testing. Additionally, some clinical research suggests that any effect of caffeine on tests of left ventricular ejection fraction may be minimal (114659). Some clinical research shows that caffeine 200 mg and 400 mg, given 90 minutes before stress testing, significantly impairs the ability of regadenoson, an adenosine receptor agonist, to detect existing ischemia (91083, 114659).\nless\nPHEOCHROMOCYTOMA TESTS\nTaking caffeine might cause false-positive diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, when diagnosis is based on tests of urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) or catecholamine concentrations. Caffeine can increase urine catecholamine and VMA concentrations (15).\nless\nPULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS\nTaking caffeine might interfere with pulmonary function test results. Forced expiratory volume in one minute (FEV1) seems to show a small improvement up to 2 hours after caffeine use. Mid-expiratory flow rates may also improve with caffeine for up to 4 hours (9607).\nless\nURATE\nTaking caffeine might falsely increase serum urate test results determined by the Bittner method. Caffeine has been shown to falsely elevate serum urate when determined by the Bittner method (11844).\nless",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nThe fatal acute oral dose of caffeine in adults is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram), although fatality has occurred at lower doses (11832, 37908, 37925, 38228, 38229, 91025, 91052, 91070, 97454). In fatal caffeine overdose, the cause of death is usually ventricular fibrillation (11838, 97454). Additional findings on autopsy after fatal overdose have identified acute cardiopulmonary failure and extensive congestion of the internal organs (95956).\n\nNumerous deaths have occurred due to caffeine overdose. In adults, the lethal blood caffeine concentration has been described as at least 80 mcg/mL (108813), although some patients with blood levels up to 100 mcg/mL have been successfully treated (112737). In males, ≥ 10 grams of caffeine has resulted in death, while in females ≥ 6.5 grams of caffeine has resulted in death (37908, 37925, 38228, 38229, 91025, 91052, 91070, 95953, 95956, 104573). In children and adolescents, the lethal blood concentration is unknown. However, multiple case reports suggest that the lethal concentration in children and adolescents may be higher than that in adults (108813). Deaths have also occurred from consumption of caffeine with alcohol (91053) and caffeine combined with other stimulants such as guarana and taurine in energy drinks or pre-workout products (91020, 104573). Life-threatening events are also more common after taking caffeine-containing energy or weight loss products when compared with non-caffeine containing products (104573).\n\nCaffeine products sold to consumers in highly concentrated or pure formulations are considered to be particularly concerning because these products have a risk of being mistakenly used in very high doses. Concentrated liquid caffeine can contain about 2 grams of caffeine in a half cup. Powdered pure caffeine can contain about 3.2 grams of caffeine in one teaspoon. Powdered pure caffeine can be fatal in adults when used in doses of 2 tablespoons or less. At least two deaths have been associated with the use of highly concentrated and pure caffeine (95700).\n\nAlthough regular and moderate caffeine use is generally well tolerated, taking large amounts of caffeine, such as >10 mg/kg/day, can produce tachycardia and premature ventricular contractions (6372, 112737). There are reports of tachycardia (13736, 37975, 38107, 91024, 91085), extrasystoles (38107, 36497, 36486), ventricular tachycardia (36511, 38104, 91020, 91024, 91070, 91089), coronary artery vasospasm (91091), transient ischemic attack (TIA) (91039), ischemic stroke (1275), hemorrhagic stroke (91092), celiac artery trunk dissection (91047), aortic dissection (37930), cardiac arrest (38298), atrial fibrillation (37924, 38040), and chest pain (13735) in people that have taken large amounts of caffeine.\n\nAlthough chronic caffeine consumption is not associated with seizures and epilepsy (37844), there have been numerous case reports of seizures with excessive caffeine intake and also when combining caffeine with other stimulants (36524, 37893, 38309, 91024, 91027, 91051, 91064, 91065).\n\nThere has also been a report of acute macular neuroretinopathy associated with frequent use of caffeine, likely in higher doses. A healthy 34-year-old female presented with worsened vision from onset of acute macular neuroretinopathy after consuming multiple caffeine-containing energy drinks. The patient's vision improved over the two months following the incident (103704).\n\nIn one case, a patient was found to have severe erosive esophagitis persisting 2 days after ingestion of 30 grams of caffeine tablets. Symptoms included throat pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, nausea, and vomiting (108815).\n\nConsuming 1-30 grams of caffeine from specific dietary supplements (e.g., No-Doz; Magnum 357s; Hydroxycut) has resulted in rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney failure requiring dialysis (36466, 91030, 91031, 108815, 112737). Additionally, excessive caffeine intake can cause hypokalemia (13735, 38034, 37953, 38003, 112737) and respiratory alkalosis (13735).\n\nLarge doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent sinus tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketosis (13734, 13735).\n\nIn one case, an otherwise healthy male presented with severe diaphoresis and shortness of breath after acutely consuming 5 energy drinks with an unspecified amount of caffeine and other ingredients. This patient was found to have an acute myocardial infarction, however, it is unclear if these symptoms were related to caffeine, other ingredients, or the combination (112741).\n\nOverdose in infants is manifested by hypertonia, agitation, irritability, sweating, tachycardia, cardiac failure, tachypnea, diuresis, and pulmonary edema. Metabolic disturbances include metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and creatine kinase elevation (13736, 13737, 97454).\nTreatment\nSurvival from caffeine overdose may be possible if subjects receive prompt and proper treatment. Treatment of caffeine toxicity primarily involves supportive care and sometimes dialysis (91024, 108813, 112737). For example, a 27-year-old female survived after consuming 50 grams of caffeine powder and receiving treatment for seizures and several ventricular fibrillation arrests (91024). In another case, a 58-year-old female survived after consuming 35 grams of caffeine and receiving treatment for arrhythmia with esmolol (36421). A 36-year-old male survived after consuming 30 grams of caffeine and receiving treatment with sedatives, fluid resuscitation, and dialysis (95956). A 23-year-old male also survived after consuming 24 grams of caffeine and receiving multiple dialysis sessions (112737).\n\nIn 2 cases of overdose in adolescents where actual or estimated maximum blood concentrations of caffeine exceeded the lethal adult level of 80 mcg/mL, both patients recovered with the administration of intravenous fluids and did not require hemodialysis (108813).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCaffeine is rapidly and almost completely (99%) absorbed from the gut after ingestion (6370, 38240, 38244, 114673). Peak levels in the circulation typically occur 30-60 minutes after ingestion (36478, 38244, 38299, 38300, 114673). However, after consuming caffeine with a meal, the peak plasma level occurs at approximately 2 hours after ingestion in healthy volunteers. Peak levels are around 7.5 ± 1.5 mg/L after a 2.5 mg/kg dose and 10 ± 2.3 mg/L after a 5 mg/kg dose (97456).\nDistribution\nCaffeine is widely distributed throughout the tissues of the body after oral, rectal, or parenteral administration (38299). It crosses the blood-brain barrier, so effects are exerted both centrally and peripherally (19331). It also passes through the placenta to the fetus (38250) and into breast milk (38195, 38217, 38218, 38239). It distributes readily into the saliva, which allows for the use of salivary testing to monitor for caffeine intake or abstinence (114664, 114673).\n\nIn one study to determine the pharmacokinetics of caffeine and ephedrine, given alone or together, in healthy subjects, the volume of distribution of caffeine was 38.6 liters (CV: 20%) (37654).\nMetabolism\nCaffeine is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzymes to paraxanthine (84%), theophylline (4%), and theobromine (12%) (6370, 36454, 36543, 37827, 38240, 38287, 114673). The rate of caffeine metabolism slows with aging, while in smokers it is metabolized faster due to increased CYP1A2 activity (98808, 100373). In females, caffeine is metabolized at different rates depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle, and oral contraceptives slow metabolism (98808). There is also a genetic component to caffeine metabolism, with different alleles and polymorphisms of the CYP1A2 and ADORA2A genes producing different metabolism rates and plasma levels (98808, 100370, 100373, 111490).\n\nDuring the first trimester of pregnancy, caffeine is rapidly metabolized in as little as 3 hours, primarily to paraxanthine. Metabolism gradually slows and can take up to 10 hours by the third trimester. Caffeine is not metabolized by the fetus and can therefore accumulate in fetal tissue (109846).\n\nIn premature infants, the predominant metabolic process is N7-demethylation, and female neonatal patients have a higher rate of caffeine metabolism than males (37571).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of caffeine in healthy adults varies between 1.5-10 hours and is decreased by smoking (8644, 11845, 36508, 36513, 37796, 38023, 38189, 38244, 38246, 98808)(111487, 114673). Caffeine is eliminated by first-order kinetics (36523). Caffeine and its metabolites are excreted in the urine, with less than 5% found unchanged (38189, 36454, 114673). Clearance of caffeine is slower during pregnancy, with a half-life of 9-11 hours (38255, 38219). In a full-term newborn baby, the half-life is 11-30 hours (38338). In premature infants, the mean half-life can be as long as 103 hours, although clearance increases with gestational age (13736, 111493). Clearance in infancy reaches adult rates within the first three months of life (13736). In individuals with liver disease, caffeine's half-life may increase to 96 hours (37629, 38338). Consistent consumption of caffeine 3 mg/kg daily for 28 days does not alter the metabolism rate of caffeine in adults (95955).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCaffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine; C8H10N4O2) is a naturally occurring bitter-tasting compound found in the leaves, seeds, or fruits of more than 60 plants, including coffee (Coffea arabica) beans, cacao (Theobroma cacao) beans, kola (Cola acuminata) nuts, guarana (Paullinia cupana) berries, and tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves (37842, 37852, 37869, 37876, 37962, 37976, 37993, 37997, 37999, 38029)(38073, 38082, 38087, 38099). Caffeine is a methylxanthine compound and is structurally related to theophylline, theobromine, and uric acid (6372).\nAdenosine antagonism\nCaffeine is a non-selective adenosine antagonist, although it most commonly binds to the adenosine A1 and A2A receptors (37720, 37942, 38086, 38090). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, increase motor unit firing rates, and produce pain suppression (6370, 98810). Regular consumption of caffeine results in sensitization of adenosine receptors and downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to withdrawal following cessation of use (38188). Blocking adenosine receptors also results in vasoconstriction and decreased cerebral blood flow (37738, 37739).\nAnalgesic effects\nCaffeine is often combined with analgesics. Caffeine seems to increase the efficacy and onset of analgesic activity by about 40% (11834). Caffeine itself might also have a mild analgesic effect (11835, 11836). The mechanism of analgesic effect is unclear. Caffeine might block mediators of pain such as adenosine receptors or inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity (38090). It might also cause mood changes that modify the perception of pain (11837). Research in animals suggests that although caffeine has additive analgesic effects when given with aspirin, it does affect inflammation (37700).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe effects of caffeine on the inflammatory response are conflicting. In theory, caffeine may exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting phosphodiesterases (38095). In animal research, caffeine has been shown to reduce microglia activation which signifies a decrease in neuroinflammation; theoretically this occurs because caffeine blocks adenosine and consequently decreases glutamate release (38011). In addition, in healthy adults, a single dose of caffeine reduced plasma markers of inflammation (38140). However, clinical research suggests that serum caffeine levels of ≥ 20 mcg/mL are associated with a pro-inflammatory state with increased cytokines in pre-term infants (38051). Additionally, caffeine did not appear to attenuate the acute inflammatory response to experimentally induced endotoxemia or to prevent organ injury (38132).\nAnticancer effects\nSome population research suggests that caffeine may have anticancer properties. Some in vitro research supports that caffeine has inhibitory effects on various cancer cells such as leukemia, hepatocellular, and bone (37981, 37892, 38316). Other in vitro research suggests that caffeine may increase the efficacy of genistein in breast cancer (37746) or increase the efficacy of radiotherapy for hepatocellular cancer and glioma cells (37909, 37973, 38316). Additionally, research in animals suggests that topical or oral caffeine may increase apoptosis of UVB-induced cancers (37695, 37736). The theoretical mechanisms of anticancer effects of caffeine include increasing adenosine deaminase activity (38021) and interfering with calcium signaling in glioblastomas (37910).\nAntidiabetic effects\nHigher plasma caffeine levels are associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes (111490), but caffeine does not appear to be effective in treating diabetes. In people with type 2 diabetes, acute administration of caffeine impairs postprandial glucose metabolism, while acute abstention from caffeine reduces postprandial glucose levels by 21%. Whether these effects also occur with caffeinated beverages and herbs is unknown (12374). Clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that caffeine enhances the activity of sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and increases urinary glucose excretion, possibly due to an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (97463).\n\nResearch in obese people suggests that caffeine ingestion may contribute to insulin resistance (12375, 13744). Research in healthy adults also shows that caffeine ingestion reduces insulin sensitivity and is associated with higher plasma levels of glucose and insulin (97445). However, one study found that patients with type 1 diabetes taking 200 mg of caffeine twice daily had increased frequency and intensity of warning signs of hypoglycemia. This may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the brain and an increase in glucose utilization by the brain (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740).\nCardiovascular effects\nObservational studies have found no association between plasma caffeine levels and the risk of cardiovascular diseases including ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and stroke (111490). However, caffeine might influence cardiovascular stress reactivity, either by potentiating the stress response itself or adding to the level reached during stress (6372). Caffeine may cause a slight decrease in heart rate after consumption and appears to raise blood pressure (6372, 37602, 37861, 38308). The blood pressure-raising effects of caffeine are greater during stress (36479, 38334). The increase in blood pressure is temporary: usually, first increases happen in the first 30 minutes, peak in 1-2 hours, and may last for over 4 hours (36539, 37732, 37989, 38000, 38300). Blood pressure is likely increased due to caffeine's vasoconstrictive effects and inhibition of adenosine receptors and adenosine-induced vasodilation (37732, 38172). Large amounts of caffeine, above 10 mg/kg/day, can also produce tachycardia and premature ventricular contractions (6372). The most common side effect of caffeine in neonates receiving caffeine for apnea is tachycardia (98807).\n\nThere is evidence caffeine inhibits platelet aggregation and suppresses thromboxane formation during blood clotting (8028, 8029).\n\nCaffeine can have positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart (11836). Caffeine can also acutely elevate both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, but might not have this effect in habitual users (2722). Clinical research supports that long-term consumption of coffee leads to diminishing blood pressure effects over time (38247). A single dose of ephedra in combination with caffeine can increase heart rate from 67 beats per minute to 82 beats per minute in young, healthy people. The combination also increases systolic blood pressure and to a lesser extent, diastolic pressure (8644). It is thought that individual gene polymorphisms alter the hemodynamic effects of caffeine. A small clinical study in healthy people with low-habitual caffeine consumption (less than 90 mg daily) shows that the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) CYP1A2 rs762551 CC genotype is associated with greater increase in blood pressure from caffeine intake when compared with the TT genotype. This association was not seen in people habitually consuming a higher daily dose of caffeine (>90 mg) (100373).\n\nCaffeine and coffee have been shown to increase levels of homocysteine (37596). Theoretically, increased homocysteine is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nCaffeine stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), heart, muscles, and possibly the pressor centers that control blood pressure (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). Caffeine reduces cerebral blood flow by vasoconstriction due to the blockade of adenosine receptors (37650, 37803, 38135). By blocking adenosine (A1 and A2) receptors caffeine may induce dopamine release and cause CNS stimulant effects (37594, 37942, 38110, 38202).\n\nCaffeine's CNS stimulant effects are thought to improve vigilance and psychomotor performance (2720, 10205, 37618, 37942).\n\nIt has also been proposed that caffeine may decrease GABA and serotonin signaling (6370). Caffeine has been shown to increase levels of serotonin and dopamine in the brain (38170, 38262, 38110, 38202). Animal research suggests that caffeine provides neuroprotection for experimentally induced neurotoxicity (37918, 37921, 37923, 37940, 38041). Animal research suggests that caffeine may improve cognition by affecting the cholinergic system (37875, 38014, 38068). In animal research, caffeine prevented the long-term and short-term memory impairment induced by scopolamine (38014).\nDiuretic effects\nCaffeine exerts a diuretic effect, with water losses estimated at 1.17 mL per milligram of caffeine (2712, 38093). Tachyphylaxis to the diuretic effect develops rapidly, diminishing fluid losses associated with caffeine intake (10206). Consuming caffeine-containing beverages or using a caffeine rinse during moderate or strenuous endurance exercise does not appear to compromise bodily hydration status (2713, 103702). Caffeine does not substantially affect the fluid status of people who drink caffeinated beverages on a regular basis (10206).\nDopaminergic effects\nCaffeine may induce dopamine release and increase dopamine levels by binding to and blocking adenosine (A1 and A2) receptors (37594, 37942, 38110, 38202). The increased dopamine increased motor activity in animal studies (37565). For preventing Parkinson's disease, caffeine may protect dopaminergic neurons in the brain from degeneration (37581, 37623, 37923, 37946, 38089). This effect appears to be related to modulation of adenosine receptors (10201). This may result in a reduction in the clinical expression of Parkinsonism (6022). Evidence suggests that tolerance to caffeine's neuroendocrine and cardiovascular effects may develop during consumption throughout the day, but tolerance appears to be lost during overnight abstinence of caffeine (6372). In animal research, caffeine blocked adenosine A1 and A2A which resulted in reduced dyskinesia that was experimentally induced by administration of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (38074).\nErgogenic effects\nFor improving athletic performance, caffeine has been shown to decrease muscle pain and perceived levels of exertion, which enables the athlete to feel less tired and to increase performance (6370, 37675, 37788, 38148, 37894, 114662, 114673). Caffeine alone or in combination with ephedrine can improve anaerobic exercise performance. Caffeine seems to enhance muscle metabolism and increases time to exhaustion and oxygen deficit, which may lead to better performance (8646). In addition, an acute, pre-exercise dose of caffeine of more than 3 mg/kg increases fat oxidation by a moderate amount during submaximal aerobic exercise performed in either the fed or fasted state when compared with placebo. This benefit appears to be greatest in sedentary or untrained individuals (104575, 114656) and caffeine-naïve individuals versus regular caffeine consumers (114656). However, some clinical studies have suggested that the fat oxidation induced by caffeine may not contribute to its ergogenic effect (114673). Consistent consumption of caffeine 3 mg/kg daily for 28 days produces tolerance to the ergogenic effects of caffeine, but the mechanism of this tolerance is poorly understood (95955).\n\nThere are several physiological mechanisms for caffeine's ergogenic effects, including increased central nervous system drive, increased catecholamine release, increased myofibrillar calcium availability, and enhanced skeletal muscle contractile capacity. As an antagonist at adenosine A1 and A2A receptors, caffeine affects the release of norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and other neurotransmitters, reducing pain and perceived exertion, and delaying fatigue. Caffeine also promotes the production of beta-endorphins and dopamine, which can lessen perceived effort and discomfort (111497, 114673).\nGastrointestinal effects\nCaffeine stimulates gastric acid secretion, and increases plasma catecholamine levels (11837, 36404, 37582, 37789).\nHepatic effects\nIn an animal model, methylxanthines like caffeine may attenuate alcoholic liver injury by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects such as decreased cytokines, lipid peroxidation, and hepatocyte necrosis (37955).\nHormonal effects\nThere is also evidence caffeine might be associated with decreased levels of testosterone and increased levels of estrone and sex-hormone binding globulin. These findings might explain why some studies have reported associations between caffeine and hormone-dependent conditions such as fibrocystic disease, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and endometriosis (8043). Preliminary evidence also suggests caffeine may increase plasma levels of cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), decrease levels of extracellular potassium, and increase levels of intracellular calcium in skeletal muscle; but the mechanisms are poorly understood (6370). Additional clinical research shows that consumption of caffeine 3 mg/kg once prior to exercise or daily for 28 days does not alter plasma cortisol, prolactin, or glucose levels during exercise (95955).\nImmunomodulating effects\nCaffeine exerts immunomodulatory effects after exercise exertion, as evidenced by suppressed lymphocyte function and altered lymphocyte counts (37646, 37687, 37742). Caffeine inhibits AMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE), leading to increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations, and decreased inflammatory response (37637, 37687).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is some clinical evidence that acute intake of caffeine causes dose-dependent increases in plasma levels of free fatty acids and ketones at 4 hours after ingestion (97456). In a meta-analysis of 94 very small studies with mostly young, lean, and fit participants, a small overall increase in fat metabolism after caffeine consumption was identified. However, effect sizes ranged from -2.36 (greater effect with placebo) to 3.87 (greater effect with caffeine), and there was significant heterogeneity across studies (111486). Meta-analyses of small clinical studies suggest that doses of at least 3 mg/kg are required to increase fat oxidation rate during exercise performed in either the fed or fasted state when compared with placebo (104575, 114656).\nMuscle effects\nIncreasing carnitine levels in skeletal muscle improves exercise performance. However, a high plasma carnitine level alone does not lead to increased muscle levels. In addition to insulin and carbohydrate, caffeine also increases movement of carnitine from plasma to muscle (\"muscle loading\"), possibly by increasing activity of Na+K+ ATPase pumps. In healthy young adults, giving caffeine orally, 6 mg/kg initially, followed by 1 mg/kg doses at 2, 3, and 4 hours, while receiving an IV infusion of carnitine, 15 mg/kg over 10 minutes followed by 10 mg/kg/hour for a total of 5 hours, results in 15% lower plasma carnitine levels when compared with receiving the carnitine infusion alone (111496). This suggests increased clearance of carnitine from plasma into skeletal muscle.\nOphthalmic effects\nIn individuals with glaucoma, coffee consumption and caffeine intake has been found to increase intraocular pressure (8540, 36464, 36465, 37670). This effect did not occur in healthy individuals (36462, 37770).\nPhotoprotective effects\nCaffeine may have photo protective effects. Laboratory studies show that topical or oral caffeine increases apoptosis of keratinocytes damaged by UVB exposure (37808). Caffeine may also attenuate UV-induced DNA damage (38019). Theoretically, caffeine may help to protect against skin cancer. Other laboratory research shows that caffeine 5 mcMol/L reduces 5-methoxypsoralen-induced photo toxicity from exposure to ultraviolet C (UVC) (38039).\nPsychological effects\nCaffeine is a psychostimulant that increases alertness, vigilance, and feelings of well-being (37593, 37698). Caffeine to lessen memory impairment induced by scopolamine (an anticholinergic agent) suggesting that caffeine may have cholinergic effects (38288). Caffeine ingestion resulted in decreased anxiety and increased pleasure in individuals undergoing caffeine withdrawal (38300). Slow-release (600 mg) caffeine consumption has been correlated with a decrease in calmness and an increase in sleep onset latency (38293).\nRenal effects\nCaffeine may stimulate the secretion of renin through adenosine receptor inhibition (38093).\nReproductive effects\nA meta-analysis of 7 clinical studies in couples undergoing in-vitro fertilization by intracytoplasmic sperm injection shows that the level of caffeine consumption by either partner is not related to the rates of pregnancy or live birth (111494). However, caffeine appears to stimulate sperm motility in vivo, resulting in a greater number of ejaculated spermatozoa, increased forward progression of sperm, and increased longevity of spermatozoa (38226, 38224). Theoretically, since caffeine inhibits cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases it also prevents the breakdown of cAMP in the sperm cell.\nRespiratory effects\nCaffeine has been used to help with respiratory diseases such as asthma and neonatal apnea (37857, 37906, 37907, 98807). Caffeine decreases airway resistance and stimulates respiration, via adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (11836, 37954, 38120). Similarly to theophylline, caffeine acts as a bronchodilator and modestly increases forced expiratory volume (FEV) and forced vital capacity (FVC) at doses of 7.2-10 mg/kg (36485, 38240). Caffeine also reduces respiratory muscle fatigue (9607, 37907, 38284). In neonatal apnea, caffeine stimulates the respiratory center in the brain, increases peripheral chemoreceptor responsiveness to carbon dioxide, increases diaphragmatic activity, and increases tidal volume (98807). Animal research shows that caffeine increases ventilation during normoxic conditions rather than during hypoxic conditions, and therefore resulted in a decrease in apnea frequency but not duration (37987).\nSleep effects\nIn a meta-analysis of 24 studies, caffeine consumption prior to bedtime reduced total sleep time by 45 minutes, increased sleep latency by 9 minutes, and reduced sleep efficiency by 7%. The duration and proportion of light sleep increased, and the duration and proportion of deep sleep decreased. There was no effect on sleep onset latency or duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. To avoid reductions in total sleep time, a cup of coffee (250 mL, 107 mg caffeine) would need to be consumed at least 9 hours before bedtime, while a 217.5 mg dose of a pre-workout caffeine supplement would need to be ingested at least 13 hours before bedtime (111487).\nWeight loss effects\nHigher plasma caffeine levels are associated with lower body mass index (BMI) and reduced whole body fat mass (111490). Caffeine increases resting energy expenditure (REE) or resting metabolic rate (RMR), and cellular thermogenesis (36414, 37546, 37712). The thermogenic effects of caffeine may be due to vasoconstriction and increase in vascular smooth muscle tone (38176). In addition, clinical research shows that drinking coffee with 6 mg/kg caffeine leads to higher satiety ratings and 725 kcal daily lower food intake in patients with obesity when compared to coffee with 3 mg/kg caffeine (91046).\n\nCaffeine also causes an increase in nonoxidative fatty acid turnover and lipid oxidation; however, the net effect on lipid oxidation is small. The effects of caffeine on energy expenditure and lipid metabolism seem to be mediated by both sympathetic and non-sympathetic mechanisms (1453, 13733, 37546, 38176, 38274). Meta-analyses show that an acute, pre-exercise dose of caffeine of more than 3 mg/kg but less than 6 mg/kg increases fat oxidation by a moderate amount during submaximal aerobic exercise performed in both the fed and fasted state when compared with placebo. This effect appears to be greatest in sedentary or untrained individuals (104575, 114656) and caffeine-naïve individuals versus regular caffeine consumers (114656). Caffeine in green tea seems to work synergistically with other constituents such as catechins and theanine to produce weight loss in animals (11960). Caffeine is often used in combination with ephedra for weight loss and seems to have additive pharmacodynamic effects. Caffeine in combination with ephedra also increases oxygen consumption. Whether the increased oxygen consumption is an indication of a significant increase in metabolism and contributes to weight loss is unknown (8645)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of calamus.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of calamus is the rhizome. Four different varieties of calamus exist, each in a different geographic region of the world. The North American variety is beta-asarone free and the European form contains less than 10% beta-asarone in the volatile oil. Others contain up to 96% beta-asarone in the volatile oil. The amount of beta-asarone appears to depend on the ploidy, or the number of chromosome sets, in the variety (5, 38422, 93977). The North American variety is high in geranyl acetate (93977). Calamus also contains alpha-asarone (93975). Beta-asarone is usually found in the highest levels in the oils from the leaves vs. acorenone from the rhizome (93977). The roots also contain calamenone, calamendiol, isocalamendiol, and other sesquiterpenes and phenylpropanoids (93977, 93978).\nAnalgesic effects\nCalamus is traditionally used for some types of pain. Analgesic effects of calamus have been shown in animal models (93978).\nAnthelmintic effects\nCalamus is traditionally used for intestinal infections. In animal research, calamus extract had anthelmintic effects. Beta-asarone was determined to be the active constituent (93974).\nAnti-asthmatic\nCalamus is traditionally used for asthma. Some preliminary evidence suggests that it might reduce phlegm and bronchospasm in people with asthma (93977). Laboratory research suggests that the mechanism of action might be based on anticholinesterase, antihistaminic, or antimuscarinic activities associated with calamus leaf extract (93979).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCalamus has been used orally and topically to reduce inflammation. Various animal models suggest that calamus extract has anti-inflammatory effects. Constituents in calamus might reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (93977, 93978).\nAnticancer effects\nCalamus has traditionally been used for cancer. The role of calamus in cancer prevention or development is not clear. The constituent beta-asarone has shown carcinogenic effects in animal research (93978). However, anti-cancer effects of calamus leaf extract and calamus oil, as well as the constituents, beta-asarone and alpha-asarone, have been reported in laboratory research (38445, 93977, 93978). Also, the anti-proliferative effect of calamus is not specific to certain cells; an inhibition of proliferation has been shown in non-cancer cell lines in laboratory research (38398).\nAnticonvulsive effects\nCalamus has traditionally been used for seizures. Laboratory research suggests that calamus oil, calamus extract, and alpha-asarone have anticonvulsant effects (93970, 93972, 93977, 93978). The anticonvulsant effects might be potentiated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity (38424, 93977, 93978). Animal research suggests that calamus extract might increase the efficacy of anticonvulsant medications such as carbamazepine and sodium valproate (93972).\nAntidiabetic effects\nCalamus is traditionally used for diabetes. Calamus extract seems to reduce high blood glucose levels in animals (93977, 93978).\nAntidiarrheal effects\nCalamus is traditionally used for gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea. Various animal models have suggested that calamus leaf and rhizome extract decrease the severity of diarrhea. Glycoside and saponin constituents might be the active compounds (33310, 93978).\nAntihyperlipidemic effects\nCalamus extract appears to have lipid lowering effects in animal models of hyperlipidemia. Potential constituents of interest include saponins and alpha-asarone. The saponins might prevent absorption and increase secretion of lipids, while alpha-asarone might reduce cholesterol biosynthesis (38397, 38466, 93977).\nAntimicrobial effects\nNumerous laboratory studies suggest that calamus has antibacterial and anti-fungal effects. Both calamus leaf and rhizome extracts show this activity. The antimicrobial activity of calamus might be related to both alpha- and beta-asarone (38416, 93977, 93978). However, calamus contains flavonoids which are also thought to contribute to antimicrobial effects (38438). Isomers of asaronaldehyde have anti-Candida properties, possibly related to the inhibition of adhesion and biofilm development by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase-II (93976).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of some calamus constituents likely play a role in the potential clinical effects of calamus. Antioxidant effects of the rhizome extract and essential oil have been shown (38392, 38400, 38436). Calamus contains phenolics with known antioxidant activity and free-radical scavenging properties. These phenolics might protect the liver against oxidant-induced injury (93978). Alpha-asarone is another constituent with possible antioxidant effects (38428).\nAntispasmodic effects\nCalamus extract and essential oil, as well as the constituent alpha-asarone, have antispasmodic effects in various animal models. It is possible that one or more constituents have calcium channel blockade abilities (38439, 93977, 93978). Beta-asarone is likely not responsible for calamus' ability to relieve smooth muscle spasms, because preparations without this compound have a measurable spasmolytic effect (6).\nAntiulcer effects\nAnimal research suggests that calamus extract protects against the development of ulcers (93978).\nCardioprotective effects\nSome research suggests that calamus might have cardioprotective effects. In animals, calamus extract lowers blood pressure. Preliminary evidence also suggests that calamus might reduce chest pain and dyspnea in individuals with ischemic heart disease. The mechanism of action is not clear (93977).\nInsecticidal effects\nCalamus may be useful as an insecticide and for repelling insects. The essential oil has insecticidal effects against various kinds of mosquitoes, flies, and beetles (38435, 38467, 93971, 93977). Constituents of interest include the asarones (93977), as well as shyobunone and isoshyobunone (93971).\nNeurologic effects\nCalamus is traditionally used to improve memory. In an animal model of Alzheimer disease, an extract of a specific calamus species (Acorus tatarinowii) and the constituent beta-asarone slows progression of cognitive impairment, possibly by enhancing cerebral blood flow and reducing amyloid-beta accumulation and related damage in the hippocampus and cortex (115350). Laboratory research shows that calamus extract and essential oil inhibits acetyl cholinesterase activity, possibly related to beta-asarone (93977). The antioxidant effects of calamus constituents might also have neuroprotective effects (38436). In vitro, calamus oil blocked the activity of NMDA receptors (38388).\nSedative effects\nSedative effects of calamus oil have been shown in laboratory models (38444, 93977, 93978). The constituent asarone, which is chemically related to reserpine, may explain calamus' sedative effects (6)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCalanus oil consists of 85% to 90% fatty acids as wax esters. The remainder consists of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and also stearidonic acid and other ingredients such as water and trans-fatty acids (91756, 91758, 97880, 97881). Calanus oil also contains astaxanthin and phytosterols (97880).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in using calanus oil as a source of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which have anti-inflammatory properties.

Therefore, its theorized that calanus oil may have cardioprotective effects (91756, 91757).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using calanus oil for weight loss. In animal research, consuming a diet high in calanus oil reduced the size of adipocytes along with a reduction in weight gain, fat around the abdomen, and hepatic steatosis (91754, 91756). However, preliminary clinical research in elderly females who do not regularly exercise shows that taking a calanus oil supplement providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 125 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 105 mg daily, while participating in exercise training for 16 weeks, does not reduce fat mass, adipocyte size, or insulin resistance when compared with exercise training and placebo (105408, 105409)."

            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally or intravenously and appropriately. Calcium is safe when used in appropriate doses (7555, 12928, 12946, 95817). However, excessive doses should be avoided. The Institute of Medicine sets the daily tolerable upper intake level (UL) for calcium according to age as follows: Age 0-6 months, 1000 mg; 6-12 months, 1500 mg; 1-8 years, 2500 mg; 9-18 years, 3000 mg; 19-50 years, 2500 mg; 51+ years, 2000 mg (17506). Doses over these levels can increase the risk of side effects such as kidney stone, hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, and milk-alkali syndrome. There has also been concern that calcium intake may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD), including myocardial infarction (MI). Some clinical research suggests that calcium intake, often in amounts over the recommended daily intake level of 1000-1300 mg daily for adults, is associated with an increased risk of CVD, CHD, and MI (16118, 17482, 91350, 107233). However, these studies, particularly meta-analyses, have been criticized for excluding trials in which calcium was administered with vitamin D (94137). Other clinical studies suggest that, when combined with vitamin D supplementation, calcium supplementation is not associated with an increased risk of CVD, CHD, or MI (93533, 107231). Other analyses report conflicting results and have not shown that calcium intake affects the risk of CVD, CHD, or MI (92994, 93533, 97308, 107231). Advise patients not to consume more than the recommended daily intake of 1000-1200 mg per day, to consider total calcium intake from both dietary and supplemental sources (17484), and to combine calcium supplementation with vitamin D supplementation (93533).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive doses.

Doses over these amounts might increase the risk of neonatal hypocalcemia-induced seizures possibly caused by transient neonatal hypoparathyroidism in the setting of excessive calcium supplementation during pregnancy, especially during the third trimester.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and intravenously, calcium is well-tolerated when used appropriately.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Belching, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, and stomach upset.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Case reports have raised concerns about calciphylaxis and kidney stones.\nCardiovascular\nThere has been concern that calcium intake may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD), including myocardial infarction (MI). Some clinical research suggests that calcium intake, often in amounts over the recommended daily intake level of 1000-1300 mg daily for adults, is associated with an increased risk of CVD, CHD, and MI (16118, 17482, 91350, 107233). However, these results, particularly meta-analyses, have been criticized for excluding trials in which calcium was administered with vitamin D (94137). Many of these trials also only included postmenopausal females. Other analyses report conflicting results, and have not shown that calcium intake affects the risk of CVD, CHD, or MI (92994, 93533, 97308, 107231). Reasons for these discrepancies are not entirely clear. It may relate to whether calcium is taken as monotherapy or in combination with vitamin D. When taken with vitamin D, which is commonly recommended, calcium supplementation does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of CVD, CHD, or MI (93533, 107231). Also, the association between calcium supplementation and CVD, CHD, or MI risk may be influenced by the amount of calcium consumed as part of the diet. Supplementation with calcium may be associated with an increased risk of MI in people with dietary calcium intake above 805 mg daily, but not in those with dietary calcium intake below 805 mg daily (17482). To minimize the possible risk of CVD, CHD, or MI, advise patients not to consume more than the recommended daily intake of 1000-1200 mg and to consider total calcium intake from both dietary and supplemental sources (17484). While dietary intake of calcium is preferred over supplemental intake, advise patients who require calcium supplements to take calcium along with vitamin D, as this combination does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of MI (93533).\n\nRarely, calcium intake can increase the risk of calciphylaxis, which usually occurs in patients with kidney failure. Calciphylaxis is the deposition of calcium phosphate in arterioles, which causes skin ulcers and skin necrosis. In a case report, a 64-year-old female with a history of neck fracture, sepsis, and ischemic colitis presented with painful leg ulcers due to calciphylaxis. She discontinued calcium and vitamin D supplementation and was treated with sodium thiosulfate and supportive care (95816).\nless\nDermatologic\nIntravenously, extravasation of calcium can cause redness, skin nodules, and tissue necrosis (116641). In two similar case reports, calcinosis cutis was reported following peripheral intravenous administration of calcium gluconate doses in neonates. The condition presented as hard, non-mobile masses with overlying redness with soft tissue calcification visible on radiographs. Both cases were managed with topical corticosteroids and observation, resulting in complete clinical and radiographic resolution within 3-4 weeks (116641).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, calcium can cause belching, flatulence, nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and diarrhea (1824, 1843, 12950, 38803). Although constipation is frequently cited as an adverse effect of calcium, there is no scientific substantiation of this side effect (1824, 1843, 1844, 1845, 12950, 38978). Calcium carbonate has been reported to cause acid rebound, but this is controversial (12935, 12936).\nless\nOncologic\nThere is some concern that very high doses of calcium might increase the risk of prostate cancer. Some epidemiological evidence suggests that consuming over 2000 mg/day of dietary calcium might increase the risk for prostate cancer (4825, 12949). Additional research suggests that calcium intake over 1500 mg/day might increase the risk of advanced prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality (14132). Consumption of dairy products has also been weakly linked to a small increase in prostate cancer risk (98894). However, contradictory research suggests no association between dietary intake of calcium and overall prostate cancer risk (14131, 14132, 104630). More evidence is needed to determine the effect of calcium, if any, on prostate cancer risk.\nless\nRenal\nKidney stones have been reported in individuals taking calcium carbonate 1500 mg daily in combination with vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 4 years (93943).\nless",

Also, population research suggests increased calcium intake from the diet and supplements reduces the risk of primary hyperparathyroidism in women. Supplemental intakes of at least 500 mg/day and dietary intakes of approximately 1100 mg/day are considered to be protective (91353).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Adequate calcium intake, from the diet and/or supplements, is recommended for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.\nThe Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF) recommends ensuring adequate calcium intake in line with the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) by age, along with adequate vitamin D intake, for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in adults over 50 years of age. Supplementation can be used to augment dietary intake when adequate dietary intake is not feasible (109425). In the US and Canada, foods containing at least 200 mg calcium with less phosphorous content than calcium can be labelled with a health claim regarding the relationship between adequate calcium intake and a reduced risk for osteoporosis (11940, 102148). However, calcium supplementation is not recommended specifically for the primary prevention of osteoporosis. The US Preventive Task Force (USPSTF) states that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or in combination, for the primary prevention of fractures in community dwelling adults without osteoporosis (95695). Also, calcium supplements do not seem to be effective for preventing loss of bone mineral density (BMD) during lactation (988), in patients who have had bone marrow transplantation (1817), or in patients who have had renal transplantation (4823, 38736, 38871).\n\nMaximal bone growth occurs in the teenage years, and then BMD in females remains relatively constant until age 30-40. After age 40, bone loss typically occurs at rates of 0.5% to 1% per year. In males, this occurs several decades later. Bone loss is more pronounced if dietary calcium intake is below the RDA, which is the case for many Americans (2571, 2578). One meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in healthy children 7-14 years old shows that fortifying food with calcium 250-1000 mg daily for up to 24 months modestly improves femoral neck BMD, but not hip or spine BMD. However, the included trials did not supplement vitamin D (107232).\n\nDuring the 5 years immediately after menopause, calcium supplementation has very little effect on bone loss (2569, 2570, 2575, 2576). The rapid loss of estrogen causes a high bone resorption rate, which increases serum calcium levels and therefore decreases intestinal absorption of calcium (2570). After this period, the typical rate of bone loss is 2% per year (2572, 2576). Taking calcium 1000-1600 mg daily as carbonate, citrate, lactate gluconate, or citrate malate salt decreases this rate by 0.25% to 1% annually (977, 979, 981, 2569, 2571, 2572, 2575, 2576, 2578, 6850)(38978, 38980, 39064). The greatest reductions (1% or more) are seen in the first 1-2 years of supplementation when bone remodeling foci can be filled (2569, 2576). After this period, the differences in rate of loss between supplemented and non-supplemented females are closer to 0.25% per year (2569, 2577). A meta-analysis of clinical evidence suggests that there is no additional benefit after 4 years (38980).\n\nSmall clinical studies have found that continuous calcium supplementation at an average daily dose of 1050 mg, started after menopause and continued for 1.5-4 years, may reduce fracture rates by 26% when compared with no calcium supplementation. The largest of these studies was conducted in nursing home residents who also received daily vitamin D; the benefits of calcium, specifically, are unclear (39386). Some research also suggests that calcium and vitamin D improves primary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in some older individuals with osteoporosis, particularly the elderly and those who are no longer community dwelling (12930, 38875, 38849, 39026, 109471).\n\nHowever, not all research is positive. One large clinical trial in elderly adults with a low-trauma fracture show that taking calcium 1000 mg daily with or without vitamin D 800 IU daily for 2-7 years does not reduce the risk of a second fracture when compared with placebo (13073). Another clinical study shows that taking calcium 1000 mg daily plus vitamin D 800 IU daily does not prevent a second fracture in elderly patients, or prevent a first fracture in elderly patients with other risk factors such as low body weight (less than 58 kg, 127.6 pounds), smoking, family history of hip fracture, or fair or poor self-reported health (12929). Also, some exploratory research suggests that supplements may need to be continued indefinitely; in adults over 68 years of age, any effects of 2 years of calcium supplements on BMD appear to be lost within 2 years after discontinuing supplements (6853).\n\nCalcium has additive effects when used with other agents such as vitamin D, estrogens, or calcitonin. Whereas calcium alone generally reduces or prevents loss of BMD, combination with other agents can produce small increases in BMD ranging from 0.3% to 3.3% depending on the combination and dosages used (978, 980, 1836, 2570, 2571, 2572, 2576). However, one meta-analysis in healthy adults shows that fortifying foods with calcium 250-1000 mg daily, in conjunction with vitamin D supplementation, for up to 24 months does not improve BMD when compared with control (107232). The full potential of osteoporosis treatments cannot be realized without adequate calcium intake (2569, 2570, 2571, 2572). Advise patients taking agents such as estrogens, calcitonin, bisphosphonates, or raloxifene (Evista) to ensure that their daily calcium intake meets the RDA. Use supplements if necessary.\n\nThe usefulness of calcium in preventing osteoporosis in males is not as well-studied. Some observational research has found that calcium 870 mg daily is not associated with changes in BMD and bone loss in males (97201). However, clinical evidence suggests that taking calcium 1000 mg daily for 2 years might improve trabecular or cortical bone mass by 2% to 4% (980, 8827, 8873). Dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D seems to moderately reduce bone loss measured in the femoral neck, spine, and total body, and seems to reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures in older patients with osteopenia or low BMD (980).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Adequate calcium intake seems to prevent symptoms of PMS.\nThere seems to be a link between low dietary calcium intake and symptoms of PMS (2004, 6847, 39007). Taking calcium 1000-1336 mg daily seems to significantly reduce depressed mood, water retention, and pain, especially if daily calcium intake is inadequate (1822, 1823, 1824, 2004, 95821). Calcium carbonate 1200 mg daily seems to decrease PMS symptom scores by about 18% when compared with placebo (1822). Increasing dietary calcium intake is also associated with a decreased risk of developing PMS. Consuming an average of 1283 mg of calcium per day from foods is associated with about a 30% lower risk of developing PMS compared with consuming an average of 529 mg daily (13094); however, taking calcium supplements does not appear to be associated with the risk of developing PMS.\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nColorectal cancer. Oral calcium seems to be beneficial for preventing colorectal cancer, especially in those with adequate vitamin D levels and normal body mass index (BMI).\nPopulation studies have found that increased intake of dietary or supplemental calcium is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer and colorectal adenomas (1047, 8820, 12120, 38951, 98898, 98899). Clinical trials and meta-analyses of clinical research also show that taking calcium supplements 1.2-2 grams daily for up to 4 years can reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence by up to 29% (970, 12118, 12950, 15267, 34596, 38718, 39042, 95817). However, not all research has been positive. Some meta-analyses of clinical research or observational studies suggest that taking calcium does not reduce the risk of familial adenomatous polyposis or colorectal cancer (34596, 39042, 39349). Other contradictory research suggests that postmenopausal females who take calcium 1000 mg daily plus vitamin D 400 IU daily do not have a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer (14290); however, this finding may not be reliable due to the high baseline intake of calcium in study participants.\n\nThe reason for these conflicting findings is not entirely clear. Vitamin D might be an important factor. People with lower than average vitamin D levels do not seem to get any benefit from calcium supplements (12118). Also, one meta-analysis of previous trials suggests that taking calcium 1200 mg daily reduces the risk of colorectal adenomas in people with a normal BMI, but not in those who are overweight or obese (99715). Despite this conflicting evidence, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim in 2005 stating that calcium supplements may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and colorectal adenomas. However, the FDA has determined that there is little scientific evidence to support this claim (102366).\nless\nFetal bone mineralization. If calcium intakes are low during pregnancy, oral calcium seems to be beneficial for increasing fetal bone density.\nWith low dietary calcium intake (less than 562 mg elemental calcium daily) during pregnancy, calcium supplementation increases fetal bone mineralization and density. However, calcium supplementation does not offer any additional benefit if calcium intakes are adequate (3263, 3264).\nless\nHypertension. Oral calcium seems to reduce blood pressure by a small amount in adults with or without hypertension. However, it is unclear if this reduction is clinically significant.\nMany clinical trials and observational studies, including a meta-analysis of 18 high-quality clinical trials, show that intake of calcium supplements or dietary calcium modestly reduces systolic blood pressure in patients with or without hypertension, usually around 1-2 mmHg. Calcium seems to be more effective for certain subpopulations of patients, such as those who are salt-sensitive or have low baseline dietary calcium intake (945, 972, 974, 976, 984, 1818, 1819, 1820, 1821, 6852)(13138, 14406, 38803, 39063, 39094, 39221, 113920, 113925). However, a large-scale clinical trial in postmenopausal females shows that taking vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 400 IU daily in combination with elemental calcium 1000 mg daily does not lower blood pressure or reduce the risk of developing hypertension (16714). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials shows that taking calcium in combination with vitamin D for up to 7 years has no effect on blood pressure (98861). The validity of this finding is limited by the poor methodological quality of the included studies.\n\nSome observational research suggests that calcium can reduce the risk for hypertension. Population research in females aged 45 years and older suggests that higher intake of calcium from both diet and supplemental sources is linked to a lower risk of developing hypertension when compared to lower calcium intake (14265). In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that calcium supplements may reduce the risk of hypertension. However, the FDA has concluded that this claim is based on supporting, rather than conclusive, evidence (102367).\n\nResearch evaluating the effect of calcium supplementation during pregnancy on the child's blood pressure has yielded conflicting findings. A systematic review of 2 clinical studies and 3 observational studies found that calcium intake during pregnancy is associated with a 1-2 mmHg reduction in the systolic blood pressure of the offspring between the ages of 1-7 years (38852). However, a separate meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies shows that calcium intake during pregnancy does not reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure in the offspring (113923).\nless\nOsteomalacia. Oral calcium seems to reverse osteomalacia caused by very low calcium intakes.\nOsteomalacia is commonly caused by vitamin D deficiency; however, very low calcium intake can also lead to osteomalacia in children and adults. Calcium supplementation can reverse osteomalacia caused by calcium deficiency. Along with appropriate vitamin D supplementation, individuals at risk of osteomalacia need sufficient calcium intake (94819).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Oral calcium seems to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, especially in high-risk individuals and those with low baseline dietary calcium intake.\nAlthough there is some conflicting evidence (971, 38756), most clinical research shows that taking calcium orally 1-2 grams daily reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia (973, 1833, 8828, 39043, 39319, 39426, 97348, 113919). A large clinical trial of 11,000 pregnant individuals in India and Tanzania shows that supplementation with 500 mg daily is similarly effective to 1500 mg daily (113908). Multiple meta-analyses which include 16-30 clinical studies have found that varying doses of calcium supplementation reduce the relative risk of pre-eclampsia by 46% to 51% when compared with placebo (97348, 113909, 113919). One of these meta-analyses found that for every 19 females treated with calcium, one episode of pre-eclampsia would be avoided (97348). Additionally, one of these meta-analyses found that calcium reduces the relative risk of pre-eclampsia by 51%, regardless of whether it is taken at a dose above or below 1000 mg daily (113919). Some research suggests that calcium supplementation may have a greater effect in individuals at high risk of pre-eclampsia or with low baseline dietary calcium intake, and when taken at greater than or equal to 20 weeks of gestation (15029, 38497, 97348, 99714, 113919). However, another meta-analysis of 30 clinical studies found a similar benefit of calcium in both high- and low-risk individuals (113919). A separate meta-analysis of 6 clinical studies conducted in China evaluated the benefits of calcium carbonate 500-600 mg daily taken in conjunction with aspirin 50-75 mg daily during pregnancy. This combination was associated with an 80% lower relative risk of pre-eclampsia and an 83% lower relative risk of pre-eclampsia with gestational hypertension when compared with routine care (113913).\n\nIn 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding the use of calcium supplements to reduce the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. However, due to the limited and conflicting research available at that time, the FDA stated that this outcome was highly unlikely (102366). Since then, large, high-quality clinical research has supported this finding. In fact, in 2016 the World Health Organization (WHO) released a recommendation to prescribe oral calcium 1.5-2 grams daily during pregnancies at high risk of pre-eclampsia if dietary calcium intakes are low (97347).\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. Oral calcium may reduce the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of 17 clinical studies shows that calcium supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the relative risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension by 30% when compared with control (113909). A separate meta-analysis of 6 clinical studies conducted in China, which evaluated the benefits of calcium carbonate 500-600 mg daily taken in conjunction with aspirin 50-75 mg daily during pregnancy, shows that this combination reduces the relative risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension by 85% when compared with routine care (113913).\nless\nRickets. Oral calcium seems to reverse rickets caused by very low calcium intakes.\nRickets is commonly caused be vitamin D deficiency; however, very low calcium intake can also lead to rickets. Calcium supplementation can reverse rickets caused by calcium deficiency (94819). A small clinical study in children with nutritional rickets shows that taking calcium 500-2000 mg daily for 24 weeks improves radiographically measured rickets caused by calcium deficiency. Rickets seems to improve more rapidly with calcium 1000 mg compared to calcium 500 mg. However, increasing the calcium dose to 2000 mg daily is not more beneficial than calcium 1000 mg daily (98904).\nless\nTooth retention. Oral calcium with vitamin D seems to help with tooth retention in the elderly population.\nA clinical trial in the elderly population shows that taking calcium citrate malate 500 mg daily along with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 700 IU daily orally for 3 years reduces the risk of tooth loss by about 52% when compared with placebo (8816).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nBreast cancer. Oral calcium, via supplementation or as part of the diet, does not seem to be beneficial for breast cancer prevention.\nAlthough some studies disagree (15631, 39041, 95811, 107237, 113917), most population research suggests that increased calcium intake is not associated with overall breast cancer risk (15631, 16715, 98895, 107236, 107237, 113917). However, one meta-analysis of observational studies shows that although higher total calcium intake is not associated with breast cancer risk, higher dietary calcium intake, specifically, may be associated with a slightly reduced risk (113917). Also, some analyses suggest that calcium intake may be associated with the risk for certain breast cancer sub-types. Some subgroup analyses suggest that calcium intake may reduce the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal, but not pre-menopausal, adults (15631, 107237) and that dietary calcium intake may reduce estrogen receptor(ER)-negative breast cancer, but not ER-positive breast cancer (107236). However, most research has not evaluated the effects of calcium supplementation or intake on breast cancer subtypes.\n\nThe best evidence to date, from a large scale clinical trial (Women's Health Initiative), shows that taking vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 400 IU daily plus calcium 1000 mg daily for 7 years after menopause does not reduce the risk of developing invasive breast cancer at the end of the study and 5 years after the end of the intervention (16715, 98895).\nless\nFractures. Although oral calcium prevents fractures in osteoporosis, most evidence shows that calcium does NOT prevent factures in people who do not have osteoporosis. See Osteoporosis discussion for more information on the use of calcium for this purpose.\nRobust meta-analyses of mostly large, high-quality clinical studies show that calcium supplementation 500-1600 mg daily for 0.5-7 years with or without vitamin D does not reduce total fractures, hip fractures, vertebral fractures, or non-vertebral fractures in older adults without osteoporosis (95822, 112486). A large-scale study in postmenopausal females aged 50-79 years who were enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) suggests that calcium 1000 mg plus vitamin D 400 IU daily for 7 years only modestly improves bone mineral density (BMD) and does not significantly reduce fracture risk. This lack of effect may have been due to low adherence to the treatment regimen. In those who were 80% adherent, the combination of calcium plus vitamin D reduced the risk of hip fracture by about 29% (14282). Also, some clinical research shows that taking calcium carbonate 1000 mg and vitamin D 400 IU for 5 years does not attenuate loss of height after menopause when compared with placebo (95810). Additional meta-analyses of clinical and observational evidence suggest that calcium supplementation is not associated with a reduced risk of vertebral or nonvertebral fractures, such as hip fractures (38589, 38888, 98895).\n\nSome other research has suggested that calcium in combination with vitamin D reduces fracture risk in older patients without osteoporosis (980, 1836, 8818, 12930, 12933, 12952, 38849, 102145, 107235); however, this research is confounded by a number of variables, including the presence of hormonal therapy and differing levels of fracture risk at baseline (1836, 8818, 95822).\n\nConflicting findings on this topic might also be due to genetic differences in patient populations. A population analysis of the WHI study found that, in older females with the lowest genetic susceptibility to low BMD, taking calcium with vitamin D is associated with a reduction in fracture risk. However, in females with a higher genetic susceptibility to low BMD, there is no association between supplementation and fracture risk. This might be because individuals with a lower susceptibility to low BMD are also more responsive to calcium and vitamin D supplementation (97357).\n\nAs of April 2018, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether supplementing with vitamin D >400 IU daily along with calcium >1000 mg daily is safe and effective for preventing fractures in community dwelling adults without vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or a history of fracture. USPSTF recommends against supplementing with calcium 1000 mg daily or less along with vitamin D 400 IU daily or less for preventing primary fractures in community-dwelling postmenopausal females (95695).\nless\nObesity. Oral calcium does not seem to improve weight loss in adults or children with overweight or obesity.\nObservational research has found that adults and children with low calcium intake are more likely to gain weight, have a higher body mass index (BMI), and be overweight or obese when compared to people with high calcium intake (12124, 12125, 12126, 12127, 14265). Additional observational research has found that increasing calcium intake is associated with weight loss in females; the results in males have been conflicting (12127, 15602, 15603).\n\nDespite these findings from observational research and a few small clinical studies (12128, 14438, 15397, 98905, 113918), most clinical research has found that increased calcium intake does not increase weight loss (12052, 13138, 15396, 15399, 38985, 39004, 97356). Further, multiple meta-analyses show that dietary or supplemental calcium does not reduce body weight in patients with obesity or overweight (95813, 15605, 116638). One of these meta-analyses show that daily dietary and supplemental calcium intake that meets the dietary reference intake (DRI) of 1000 mg or more daily does not increase weight loss in overweight individuals or patients with obesity when compared with intake below the DRI (95813). Overall, the validity of these findings is limited by a high risk of bias and heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including population and dose.\nless\nOverall mortality. Oral calcium does not seem to reduce overall mortality.\nWhile some population research has found that calcium taken in combination with vitamin D in older females is associated with a lower risk of death (97353), most evidence shows that calcium, with or without vitamin D, has no effect on all-cause mortality (93533, 97308, 113584).\nless\nINEFFECTIVE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral calcium does not reduce the risk of developing CVD and may actually increase risk in some patients.\nClinical research shows that calcium does not decrease CVD risk. Several separate meta-analyses of clinical and population research involving over 50,000 patients show that taking calcium 600-1200 mg daily for up to 7 years does not reduce the risk of CVD-related outcomes, including stroke and myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, or overall mortality (39018, 91350, 92994, 93533, 97308, 98902, 107231, 107233). No association was found between total dietary or supplemental calcium intake with or without vitamin D and the risk of CVD or mortality (91350, 93533, 97308).\n\nIn fact, some population and clinical research has found that when calcium is used alone or with vitamin D, there is an INCREASED risk of CVD and coronary heart disease (38077, 107233). However, other clinical research disagrees (93533). One meta-analysis of high-quality randomized controlled trials shows that taking calcium for 2-7 years increases the risk of CVD and coronary heart disease by 1.1-1.2 times when compared with control. However, the majority of the included research evaluated postmenopausal females and it is unclear if this finding is applicable to other populations (107233).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Intravenous calcium does not prevent nerve pain in patients given oxaliplatin. Oral calcium has not been evaluated for this purpose.\nWhile pooled analyses of cohort studies and randomized controlled trials suggest that calcium and magnesium infusion decreases the incidence of oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity, a meta-analysis of only randomized controlled trials shows that the infusion has no effect in preventing neurotoxicity (90028, 90029, 90031). Additionally, clinical trials show that administering calcium gluconate 1 gram with magnesium sulfate 1 gram intravenously immediately before, or before and after, the administration of a single oxaliplatin cycle (90005), or over the entire 6-cycle course of oxaliplatin, does not improve symptoms of neurotoxicity when compared with placebo (96474).\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). Oral calcium does not prevent MI. When taken in the absence of vitamin D, oral calcium may increase the risk of MI.\nPopulation research has found that increased dietary intake of calcium is associated with a decreased risk of MI (91350). However, a 2010 meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking calcium at a dose of at least 500 mg daily is associated with an approximate 30% INCREASE in the risk of MI in patients over the age of 40. According to this analysis, one additional case of MI will occur for every 69 patients that take calcium for 5 years (17482). A more recent meta-analysis of high-quality randomized controlled trials shows that taking calcium for 2-7 years increases the risk of MI by 1.2 times when compared with control. However, the majority of the included research studied postmenopausal females and it is unclear if this finding is applicable to other populations (107233) In contrast, other meta-analyses of clinical research have shown that taking calcium for up to 7 years is NOT associated with an increased risk of MI, including a meta-analysis that only included postmenopausal females (93533, 107231).\n\nReasons for these discrepancies are not entirely clear. It may relate to whether calcium is taken as monotherapy or in combination with vitamin D. When taken with vitamin D, which is commonly recommended, calcium supplementation does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of MI in postmenopausal females (93533). Also, the association between calcium supplementation and MI risk may be influenced by the amount of calcium consumed as part of the diet. Supplementation with calcium may be associated with an increased risk of MI in people with dietary calcium intake above 805 mg daily, but not in those with dietary calcium intake below 805 mg daily (17482)\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlcohol use disorder. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for alcohol use disorder.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking calcium carbonate 800 mg and vitamin D 200 IU orally daily for 14 days modestly reduces alcohol craving scores and withdrawal scores when compared with placebo in adults with alcohol dependence that are undergoing withdrawal. Taking calcium carbonate did not reduce the need for diazepam; however, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (107234).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for atherosclerosis.\nA population study has found that taking calcium 1.2 grams daily for 3 years has no effect on carotid intima thickness or carotid atherosclerosis incidence. A total calcium intake (dietary and supplemental) of at least 1794 mg daily in older females may be associated with a decreased risk of carotid atherosclerosis when compared with a total calcium intake below 1010 mg daily (97351).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral calcium during pregnancy is beneficial for reducing the odds of autism spectrum disorder in the offspring.\nA small observational study found that calcium supplementation during pregnancy is associated with a 52% reduced odds of an autism spectrum disorder in the offspring (98900).\nless\nBrain tumor. It is unclear if dietary calcium intake is associated with risk of brain tumor.\nA meta-analysis of 4 case-control studies has found that higher dietary calcium intake is associated with a lower odds of brain tumor when compared with lower dietary intake (113922). The validity of this finding is limited by the exploratory nature of the included studies, which analyzed all dietary ingredients for any potential associations.\nless\nCancer. Oral calcium alone does not seem to prevent cancer. It is unclear if oral calcium with vitamin D is beneficial for preventing cancer.\nTaking calcium alone does not seem to significantly reduce the risk of cancer (12118, 15629). The role of calcium in cancer prevention when taken along with vitamin D is controversial, as conflicting results exist. One clinical trial shows that healthy postmenopausal females who take supplemental calcium 1400-1500 mg daily plus vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 1100 IU daily have a 60% lower relative risk for developing cancer of any type. Approximately 25 postmenopausal females would need to take this combination for 4 years to prevent one occurrence of cancer (15629). However, a more recent clinical study shows that healthy postmenopausal females who take supplemental calcium 1500 mg daily plus vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily do not have a reduced risk of cancer at 4 years (93943). Reasons for the disparate results are not entirely clear. The discrepancies do not appear to be related to baseline vitamin D levels or different study populations. It is possible that, given the 10-year time lapse between the two publications, the discrepancies result from differences in cancer detection capability. Also, since cancer risk was a secondary outcome measure in the earlier study and a primary outcome measure in the more recent study, it is possible that the discrepancies result from differences in statistical methodologies. The effect of vitamin D and calcium on cancer risk in males and younger patients is not known.\n\nThere is also interest in using calcium for reducing the risk of hematological malignancies. An analysis of the Women's Health Initiative study shows that taking calcium 1000 mg daily in combination with vitamin D3 400 IU for up to 10 years is associated with a 20% reduction in the risk of hematologic malignancies when compared with placebo. However, no effect on hematologic malignancy related mortality was seen (97354).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for depression prevention.\nPopulation research has found no association between a higher dietary intake of calcium and the risk of depression when compared with a lower dietary intake of calcium (96480).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if dietary calcium intake is associated with type 2 diabetes risk or if oral calcium with vitamin D is beneficial in patients with gestational diabetes.\nSome population research has found that a higher intake of calcium from the diet or supplements, alone or in combination with vitamin D, is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with lower calcium intake (14265, 16713, 96473, 113929). One meta-analysis of cohort and cross-sectional studies found that the highest level of dietary calcium intake is associated with an 18% relative reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes when compared with the lowest level of intake. A dose-response analysis suggests that each 300, 600, and 1000 mg per day increase in dietary calcium intake is associated with a 7%, 14%, and 23% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, respectively (113929). However, population research is often limited by confounding variables. For example, one analysis suggests that any beneficial effect might be influenced by concomitant magnesium intake (96473, 113929), while another suggests that any benefit from increased intake may be more pronounced in females, adults aged 50 years or older, and Asian populations (113929). Furthermore, other population research has found that serum calcium levels higher than 9.6 mg/dL are associated with greater risk of developing diabetes in Chinese adults with osteoporosis (95815).\n\nCalcium has also been studied in pregnant adults with gestational diabetes. A meta-analysis of 4 moderate-quality clinical studies shows that taking calcium 800-1000 mg daily for 6 weeks with vitamin D reduces fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo (115579). However, clinical significance is unclear. Furthermore, the validity of these results is limited by the lack of data regarding other dietary or medication interventions. It is unclear if these benefits are due to calcium, vitamin D, or the combination.\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for dyslipidemia.\nOne clinical study in adults with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia shows that adding calcium carbonate 400 mg three times daily to a low-fat diet (American Heart Association Step 1) for 6 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 4% and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 4% when compared with the low-fat diet and placebo (2557). In contrast, a clinical study in females with dyslipidemia shows that taking calcium 800 mg daily for 2 years INCREASES total cholesterol levels and carotid intima-media thickness in postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, females when compared with placebo (97350).\n\nCalcium supplementation has also been evaluated in combination with vitamin D. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials including adults with normolipidemia and dyslipidemia shows that taking calcium 500-2000 mg daily and vitamin D 200-7142 IU daily modestly improves HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, but not LDL cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses suggest that calcium and vitamin D supplementation is most beneficial in patients with dyslipidemia at baseline (107227).\n\nThe relationship between dietary calcium intake and serum lipid levels has also been evaluated in observational research. A meta-analysis of 7-11 observational studies found that dietary calcium intake is not associated with total cholesterol levels, although small differences in individual lipid parameters were identified. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 4-9 observational studies suggests that calcium intake is not associated with the risk of developing hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, or low HDL. A subgroup analysis found that higher calcium intake may be associated with lower triglyceride levels in Asian populations (113927). Overall, these findings are limited by significant heterogeneity and the cross-sectional nature of the included studies.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for reducing pain associated with dysmenorrhea.\nClinical research shows that taking calcium carbonate 1000 mg with vitamin D 5000 IU daily for three menstrual cycles does not reduce pain when compared with placebo in patients with primary dysmenorrhea (95821). However, calcium carbonate 1000 mg taken alone seems to reduce pain when compared with placebo.\nless\nEndometrial cancer. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for endometrial cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of population research suggests that calcium supplements may reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, but dietary calcium does not seem to have any effect (38893).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for reducing exercise-induced muscle damage.\nA very small clinical study in resistance-trained adults shows that taking calcium carbonate 500 mg 4 times daily for 3 weeks does not attenuate exercise-induced muscle damage from bench presses when compared with placebo (113933). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nFall prevention. It is unclear if oral calcium with vitamin D is beneficial for preventing falls.\nA network meta-analysis suggests that taking calcium without vitamin D does not reduce fall risk when compared to placebo (114504).\n\nThese findings align with earlier data suggesting that calcium in combination with vitamin D, but not calcium alone, might prevent falls by decreasing body sway and normalizing systolic blood pressure (6362, 11939, 39038). Other prior research also suggests the potential importance of combining calcium and vitamin D (11916).\n\nDietary calcium has also been evaluated with vitamin D. Preliminary clinical research in adults residing in a health care facility shows that taking vitamin D supplements while increasing dietary calcium and protein for 2 years reduces falls by 11% when compared with standard diets. Intervention diets were supplemented with milk, yogurt, and cheese to provide calcium 1142 mg and protein 69 grams daily (107235).\n\nThere might also be different effects in females compared to males. In one study, females aged 65 years or older who took vitamin D 700 IU plus calcium citrate 500 mg daily over a 3-year period had a 46% lower risk of falling. However, this combination did not decrease falls in males (14291).\nless\nFluorosis. Oral calcium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nTaking calcium orally, in combination with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and vitamin D, seems to be effective for reducing excessive fluoride levels in children and improving symptoms of fluorosis in children aged 6-12 years (990).\nless\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral calcium in combination with vitamin D is beneficial for preventing heart failure.\nBased on a secondary analysis of a large-scale clinical trial (Women's Health Initiative), taking calcium 1000 mg with vitamin D 400 IU daily does not reduce the risk of heart failure in the overall population or in individuals at high risk. However, in a subgroup of postmenopausal females without risk factors for heart failure, calcium and vitamin D supplementation might reduce the risk of developing heart failure by about 37% (97307).\nless\nLead toxicity. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for reducing blood levels of lead.\nLead is mobilized along with calcium from bone during pregnancy and lactation, resulting in increased serum concentrations of lead. One clinical study suggests that calcium supplementation does not significantly decrease these elevated lead concentrations (1586). However, another clinical study suggests that taking calcium reduces blood lead levels by 11% when compared with placebo, with greatest effects observed in those with high baseline levels of lead (38957).\nless\nLow birth weight. It is unclear if oral calcium supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of low birth weight.\nA meta-analysis of several moderate-quality clinical studies in pregnant patients shows that taking calcium 1000-2000 mg daily does not reduce the risk of low birth weight in infants when compared with placebo or no treatment (116643).\nless\nLyme disease. Although there is interest in using oral calcium for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of calcium for this condition.\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral calcium alone or with vitamin D is beneficial for metabolic syndrome prevention.\nPopulation research has found that a higher intake of calcium from diet and supplements alone, or in combination with vitamin D, is associated with a lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome when compared with lower calcium intake (14265, 16713).\nless\nNeonatal jaundice. It is unclear if oral calcium with vitamin D is beneficial for treating neonatal jaundice.\nA single-center clinical study in India in hospitalized term and preterm neonates with jaundice receiving phototherapy plus vitamin D3 shows that taking calcium phosphate 75-80 mg/kg/day reduces the total phototherapy time by approximately 5.5 hours and total serum bilirubin (TSB) level when compared with control (116642). However, clinical significance is unclear.\nless\nNephrotic syndrome. It is unclear if oral calcium with vitamin D is beneficial for preventing nephrotic syndrome.\nClinical research shows that taking calcium 500-1000 mg daily for 3 months in combination with vitamin D3 60,000 IU daily or weekly for 4 weeks has no effect on bone mineral density or the risk of relapse in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (97355).\nless\nNonmelanoma skin cancer. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for preventing keratinocyte carcinomas.\nIn middle aged and older adults recently diagnosed with a colorectal adenoma, clinical research shows that taking calcium 1200 mg daily as calcium carbonate for 3-5 years does not reduce the incidence of keratinocyte cancer when compared with placebo over a median of 8 years. A sub-group analysis shows that taking calcium alone or with vitamin D3 1000 IU daily reduced the risk of invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by a moderate amount, but had no effect on the risk of basal cell carcinoma (104622).\nless\nOral mucositis. When used in combination with fluoride treatments, a calcium phosphate mouth rinse seems to prevent and reduce mucositis-related pain in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing HSCT shows that using a particular mouth rinse (Caphosol, EUSA Pharma) containing calcium phosphate, in combination with fluoride treatments, reduces days of mucositis, the duration of pain, and the dose and days of morphine used when compared with placebo and fluoride treatment (38611).\nless\nOvarian cancer. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for ovarian cancer prevention.\nAn older meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies found that dietary calcium intake is not associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer (38792). However, a more recent pooled analysis of 15 cohort and case-control studies has found that the highest intake of dietary or dairy calcium is associated with a 20% lower risk of ovarian cancer when compared to the lowest intake (97349).\nless\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome. It is unclear if intravenous or oral calcium is beneficial in patients with OHSS.\nA meta-analysis of several lower-quality clinical studies in females undergoing assisted reproductive fertility treatments and with high risk for OHSS shows that calcium, administered as intravenous calcium gluconate 1 gram daily for 4 days or oral calcium dobesilate 1500 mg daily for 21 days, has similar rates of OHSS, clinical pregnancy, live birth, and spontaneous abortion when compared to cabergoline (116639). The validity of these results is limited by the heterogeneity among clinical studies including dose and duration of the intervention and control regimens. Furthermore, most clinical studies were conducted in Egypt.\nless\nPostpartum depression. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for reducing postpartum depression risk.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking calcium 2 grams daily beginning at 11-21 weeks gestation reduces depression at 12 weeks postpartum when compared with placebo. However, no benefit is seen at 6 weeks postpartum (39447).\nless\nPregnancy-related leg cramps. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for preventing leg cramps during pregnancy.\nA small clinical study shows that taking calcium 1 gram twice daily (as a mixture of salts) for 2 weeks can reduce pregnancy-related leg cramps during the second half of pregnancy when compared with no treatment (2567).\nless\nPrematurity. It is unclear if supplemental calcium is beneficial for the growth and development of preterm infants.\nA small clinical study in preterm infants consuming human milk shows that supplementation with calcium 45 mg/kg daily and phosphorus 25 mg/kg daily does not affect infant weight, length, head circumference, or risk of osteopenia after 6 weeks when compared with human milk alone (113924). However, the duration and size of this study may have been too limited to detect any difference between groups.\nless\nPreterm labor. It is unclear if oral calcium reduces the risk of preterm labor.\nA meta-analysis of several moderate-quality clinical studies in pregnant patients shows that taking calcium 1000-2000 mg daily reduces the relative risk of preterm labor prior to 37 weeks of gestation by 20% when compared with placebo or no treatment (116643). However, calcium does not reduce preterm labor prior to 34 weeks of gestation. The validity of these results is limited due to the heterogeneity across clinical studies including calcium dose, duration, and timing of initiation. Conversely, another meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies shows that taking calcium supplements during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of preterm labor when compared with placebo (113909). A separate meta-analysis of 7 clinical studies conducted in China, which evaluated the benefits of calcium carbonate 500-600 mg daily taken in conjunction with aspirin 50-75 mg daily during pregnancy, shows that this combination reduces the relative risk of preterm labor by 74% when compared with routine care (113913).\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for prostate cancer prevention.\nSome clinical research shows that taking calcium 1200 mg daily might decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer (14133). However, some epidemiological research suggests that consuming very high doses of calcium, over 2000 mg daily, might actually increase the risk of developing prostate cancer (14134). Some epidemiological research also suggests that doses greater than 1500 mg daily increase the risk of poorly differentiated, clinically advanced, and fatal prostate cancer (14132). Consumption of dairy products has also been weakly linked to a modest increase in risk of prostate cancer (98894). However, contradictory research suggests that there is no association between dietary intake of calcium and overall risk of prostate cancer (14131, 14132, 104630).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral calcium is beneficial for stroke prevention.\nSome population research has found that increasing dietary calcium intake is associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke (4822, 38678). However, other population research has found that increasing dietary calcium intake is not associated with a decreased risk of stroke (91350). One meta-analysis of high-quality randomized controlled trials shows that taking calcium for 2-7 years does not affect the risk of stroke when compared with control. However, the majority of the included research evaluated postmenopausal females, and it is unclear if this finding is applicable to other populations (107233).\nless\nVertigo. Oral calcium with vitamin D might reduce positional vertigo; the effect of calcium when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study in adults with recurrent benign paroxysmal positional vertigo shows that taking calcium 500 mg and vitamin D 400 IU twice daily for one year reduces annual recurrence of vertigo by 27% when compared with no treatment. The number needed to treat to prevent vertigo was 3.7 (103681). It is unclear if this benefit is due to vitamin D, calcium, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate calcium for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: The daily recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calcium varies based on age as follows: 19-50 years, 1000 mg; females 51 years and older, 1200 mg; males 51-70 years, 1000 mg; males 71 years and older, 1200 mg. For those 19 years or older who are pregnant or lactating, 1000 mg (17506). Calcium supplements have most often been used in doses of 500-1500 mg daily. Patients should not exceed the tolerable upper limit of 2000-2500 mg daily, unless advised by a healthcare provider. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nIt is usually recommended that calcium be administered with food in doses of 500 mg or less. Absorption of calcium from supplements is greatest under these conditions since the active transport system for calcium in the small bowel is easily saturated (1834, 8832). Calcium carbonate and calcium citrate are the two most commonly used forms of calcium (945, 8832).\n\nDiets high in caffeine, sodium, or protein may increase urinary calcium excretion. People who consume diets high in these ingredients may require additional dietary or supplemental calcium (1834, 2570, 2669, 2670, 21647, 38580, 38738, 39044, 39323, 39415).\n\nCalcium supplements may decrease the absorption of dietary iron, zinc, and magnesium. However, in people with adequate stores of these minerals, this does not appear to have a clinically significant effect on long-term iron, zinc, or magnesium status (1848, 1849, 1850, 7135, 7308, 8822, 8831, 21634, 21635, 21637).\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nIntravenous/Intramuscular:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: The daily adequate intake (AI) for calcium is 200 mg for those 0-6 months of age and 260 mg for those 7-12 months of age. For children 1 year of age and older, a daily recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been established as follows: 1-3 years, 700 mg; 4-8 years, 1000 mg; 9-18 years, 1300 mg. For those under 19 years of age who are pregnant or lactating, 1300 mg (17506).\nIntravenous/Intramuscular:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nCalcium carbonate and calcium citrate are the two most commonly used forms of calcium (945, 8832). Calcium carbonate contains 400 mg calcium/gram and calcium citrate contains 211 mg calcium/gram. For example, 1000 mg elemental calcium = 2500 mg calcium carbonate = 4700 mg calcium citrate. Also, 1 mL of calcium chloride provides 27 mg of elemental calcium and 1 mL of calcium gluconate provides 9 mg of elemental calcium (12928).",

Other types of calcium do not increase aluminum absorption.\nCalcium citrate can increase the absorption of aluminum when taken with aluminum hydroxide. The increase in aluminum levels may become toxic, particularly in individuals with kidney disease (21631). However, the effect of calcium citrate on aluminum absorption is due to the citrate anion rather than calcium cation. Calcium acetate does not appear to increase aluminum absorption (93006).\nless\nBICTEGRAVIR/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE (Biktarvy)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nCalcium might decrease levels of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide by reducing its absorption when taken in a fasting state.\nAdvise patients that bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide and calcium can be taken together if taken with food. However, if taken on an empty stomach, bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide should not be taken with, or 2 hours after, calcium containing products (116930).\nless\nBISPHOSPHONATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nC (Consensus)\nCalcium reduces the absorption of bisphosphonates.\nAdvise patients to take bisphosphonates at least 30 minutes before calcium, but preferably at a different time of day.

It can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to cause systemic effects, including hypercalcemia (12938). Theoretically, combining calcipotriene with calcium supplements might increase the risk of hypercalcemia.\nless\nCALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nIntravenous calcium may decrease the effects of calcium channel blockers; oral calcium is unlikely to have this effect.\nIntravenous calcium is used to decrease the effects of calcium channel blockers in the management of overdose. Intravenous calcium gluconate has been used before intravenous verapamil (Isoptin) to prevent or reduce the hypotensive effects without affecting the antiarrhythmic effects (6124). But there is no evidence that dietary or supplemental calcium when taken orally interacts with calcium channel blockers (12939, 12947).\nless\nCEFTRIAXONE (Rocephin)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nCo-administration of intravenous calcium and ceftriaxone can result in precipitation of a ceftriaxone-calcium salt in the lungs and kidneys.\nAvoid administering intravenous calcium in any form, such as parenteral nutrition or Lactated Ringers, within 48 hours of intravenous ceftriaxone. Case reports in neonates show that administering intravenous ceftriaxone and calcium can result in precipitation of a ceftriaxone-calcium salt in the lungs and kidneys. In several cases, neonates have died as a result of this interaction (15794, 21632). So far there are no reports in adults; however, there is still concern that this interaction might occur in adults.\nless\nDIGOXIN (Lanoxin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Clinical cohort study)\nUsing intravenous calcium with digoxin might increase the risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmias.\nHypercalcemia increases the risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmias with digoxin (12940). However, one retrospective analysis of clinical data suggests that intravenous calcium does not increase the risk of dysrhythmias or mortality in patients receiving digoxin (38960).\nless\nDILTIAZEM (Cardizem, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, calcium may reduce the therapeutic effects of diltiazem.\nHypercalcemia can reduce the effectiveness of verapamil in atrial fibrillation (10574).

Pharmacokinetic research suggests that taking calcium carbonate 1200 mg concomitantly with dolutegravir 50 mg reduces plasma levels of dolutegravir by almost 40%. Calcium appears to decrease levels of dolutegravir through chelation (93578).\nless\nELVITEGRAVIR (Vitekta)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nCalcium seems to reduce levels of elvitegravir.\nAdvise patients to take elvitegravir either 2 hours before or 2 hours after taking calcium supplements. Pharmacokinetic research suggests that taking calcium along with elvitegravir can reduce blood levels of elvitegravir through chelation (94166).\nless\nLEVOTHYROXINE (Synthroid, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Clinical cohort study)\nCalcium seems to reduce the absorption and effectiveness of levothyroxine.\nAdvise patients to take levothyroxine and calcium supplements at least 4 hours apart. Calcium reduces levothyroxine absorption, probably by forming insoluble complexes (5082). Calcium carbonate supplements reduce effectiveness of levothyroxine in patients with hypothyroidism (5081, 5082, 6137).\nless\nLITHIUM\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Clinical cohort study)\nTheoretically, concomitant use of calcium and lithium may increase this risk of hypercalcemia.\nClinical research suggests that long-term use of lithium may cause hypercalcemia in 10% to 60% of patients (38953). Theoretically, concomitant use of lithium and calcium supplements may further increase this risk.\nless\nQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCalcium seems to reduce the absorption of quinolone antibiotics.\nAdvise patients to take oral quinolones at least 2 hours before or 4-6 hours after calcium supplements or calcium-fortified foods. Taking calcium at the same time as oral quinolones can reduce quinolone absorption. Calcium binds to quinolones in the gut (4412, 10339, 21638, 38570).\nless\nRALTEGRAVIR (Isentress)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nCalcium may reduce levels of raltegravir.\nPharmacokinetic research shows that taking a single dose of calcium carbonate 3000 mg along with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily modestly decreases the mean area under the curve of raltegravir, but the decrease does not necessitate a dose adjustment of raltegravir (94164). However, a case of elevated HIV-1 RNA levels and documented resistance to raltegravir has been reported for a patient taking calcium carbonate 1 gram three times daily plus vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 400 IU three times daily in combination with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily for 11 months. It is thought that calcium reduced raltegravir levels by chelation, leading to treatment failure (94165).\nless\nSOTALOL (Betapace)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCalcium seems to reduce the absorption of sotalol.\nAdvise patients to separate doses by at least 2 hours before or 4-6 hours after calcium.

            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nIRON\nCalcium can decrease iron absorption.\nTaking calcium from supplements or from food sources can decrease iron absorption from foods (21634, 21635). Some clinical research shows that iron absorption is increased by 30% to 50% if calcium-containing dairy products are not served with meals (21635). However, in people with adequate stores of iron, taking calcium with iron does not have any clinically significant effect on long-term iron status (1848, 1849, 1850, 7135, 7308, 8822, 8831). Advise people at high risk for iron deficiency to take calcium supplements at bedtime, instead of with meals, to avoid inhibiting iron absorption.\nless\nLYCOPENE\nCalcium can decrease lycopene absorption.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a specific calcium carbonate supplement (Cacit 500, Warner Chilcott) 500 mg while eating a meal containing 19 mg of lycopene reduces the bioavailability of lycopene by 83% when compared with no calcium supplement. The mechanism of this effect is not known; however, it is suspected that calcium inhibits the uptake of lycopene in the gastrointestinal tract (95578). Advise patients to take calcium supplements at bedtime, instead of with meals, to avoid potentially inhibiting dietary lycopene absorption.\nless\nMAGNESIUM\nCalcium can decrease magnesium absorption.\nCalcium supplements can decrease the absorption of dietary magnesium, but only at very high, supra-therapeutic doses (2600 mg daily). In people with adequate magnesium stores, calcium does not have any clinically significant effect on long-term magnesium balance. Advise patients at high risk for magnesium deficiency to take calcium supplements at bedtime, instead of with meals, to avoid inhibiting dietary magnesium absorption (4623, 7555, 11159, 21637).\nless\nVITAMIN D\nTaking calcium in combination with excessive amounts of vitamin D might increase the risk of hypercalcemia.\nConcomitant administration with vitamin D increases active absorption of calcium in the small intestine in most patients (7555, 98903, 98897). While hypercalcemia is not a concern when appropriate doses of vitamin D are used, taking doses greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU per day for long durations can increase the risk of hypercalcemia (17506).\nless\nZINC\nCalcium can decrease zinc absorption.\nCalcium supplements may decrease the absorption of dietary zinc. However, in people with adequate zinc stores, this does not have a clinically significant effect on long-term zinc balance (1848, 1849, 1850, 7135, 7308, 8822, 8831, 21634, 21635, 21637).\nless",

Patients with achlorhydria have lower calcium absorption in a fasting state compared to people with normal gastric acid secretion; however, when calcium citrate or calcium carbonate are taken with a meal, reduced gastric acidity does not seem to significantly impair absorption (15356, 15357). In the fasting state, calcium citrate is significantly better absorbed than calcium carbonate in patients with achlorhydria.\nless\nKIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\nIn patients with kidney dysfunction, calcium carbonate supplementation increases the risk of hypercalcemia and alkalosis (7555). In patients with impaired kidney function, doses as low as 4 grams daily might cause hypercalcemia and milk-alkali syndrome (1843, 6849).\nless\nSARCOIDOSIS\nSarcoidosis results in an increased risk of excessive calcium absorption and hypercalcemia (12951); use with caution.\nless\nSMOKING\nPatients who smoke should make sure to consume adequate amounts of calcium.

This induces movement of calcium from bone into the blood, increasing urinary calcium excretion (4400). There are reports of negative calcium balance after short-term use of large doses of aluminum-containing antacids, and of osteomalacia after prolonged use of large doses, especially in people with a low dietary phosphate intake, or a low dietary calcium intake (less than 250 mg per day) (4400, 5979).

Occasionally this can lead to osteomalacia, usually in patients receiving large doses of cholestyramine (more than 32 grams per day), or prolonged therapy (more than two years). It can also occur in the presence of additional risk factors such as ileal resection or primary biliary cirrhosis (4458, 5655, 5809, 5838). However, cholestyramine (24 grams/day) for treatment of hyperlipidemia in otherwise healthy men doesn't seem to affect vitamin D or calcium levels (2672).\nless\nCORTICOSTEROIDS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTaking corticosteroids might reduce calcium status and increase calcium requirements.\nCorticosteroids, in daily doses equivalent to 7.5 mg prednisone or more, cause significant bone loss, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fractures. The severity increases with duration of therapy. Mechanisms include decreased absorption and increased excretion of calcium, reduction in sex hormones, and inhibition of bone formation. Advise adults taking prednisone 7.5 mg/day (or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids) for six months or longer to maintain a daily calcium intake of 1500 mg/day. They may also need a vitamin D supplement (e.g., 800 IU/day). Monitor serum calcium (1832, 4462, 4463, 4464, 4465, 4466, 4467). For information on foods that are rich in calcium, see our chart.\nless\nH2-BLOCKERS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nH2-blockers decrease calcium absorption, but this is unlikely to increase calcium requirements for most people.\nCalcium must be solubilized in order to be absorbed. The solubility of calcium is dependent on an acidic pH. Therefore, it has been assumed that decreased gastric acidity decreases absorption of calcium supplements. Some evidence also shows that patients with low gastric acid have lower calcium absorption in a fasting state compared to people with normal gastric acid secretion. Calcium citrate is significantly better absorbed than calcium carbonate in these patients in a fasting state (15356). However, when taken with a meal, decreased gastric acidity due to drugs such as H2 blockers or due to achlorhydria, does not seem to significantly impair absorption of calcium carbonate or calcium citrate (15357).

Short-term use of magnesium is unlikely to increase calcium requirements in most people.\nLarge doses of magnesium salts may cause hypocalcemia. This is most likely with intravenous doses sufficient to produce hypermagnesemia, such as in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction or premature labor (2730, 2731). High magnesium levels increase urinary calcium excretion, possibly due to changes in the renal threshold for calcium absorption, or reduced parathyroid hormone secretion (2730, 2731). Calcium supplementation is unlikely to be needed with short-term, intravenous magnesium therapy. Oral magnesium supplements (e.g., magnesium oxide 576 mg/day) do not affect calcium absorption (4623).\nless\nMINERAL OIL\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nTaking mineral oil can reduce calcium absorption and increase calcium requirements.\nMineral oil can interfere with calcium utilization and retention by reducing absorption of both calcium and vitamin D (4495).

The solubility of calcium is dependent on an acidic pH. Therefore, it has been assumed that decreased gastric acidity decreases absorption of calcium supplements. Some evidence also shows that patients with low gastric acid have lower calcium absorption in a fasting state compared to people with normal gastric acid secretion. Calcium citrate is significantly better absorbed than calcium carbonate in these patients in a fasting state (15356).

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nOrally, calcium in doses above the tolerable upper intake level can increase the risk of kidney stones (17506). Prolonged ingestion of large amounts of calcium carbonate (usually greater than 20 grams per day) can cause hypercalcemia, milk-alkali syndrome (1843), nephrocalcinosis, and renal insufficiency. In one case report, the accidental ingestion of approximately 70 grams of calcium chloride, used as a dehumidifying agent, by a 66-year-old patient with dementia resulted in loss of consciousness, gastric necrosis, and hypercalcemia (104631).\n\nThere is also some concern that calcium in doses above the UL might increase the risk of prostate cancer (4825, 12949, 14132). However, other research has not confirmed this association (14131, 14132, 104630).\n\nSome calcium supplements, including oyster shell and refined calcium products, may be contaminated with lead (997, 6459, 6460). In one report, 8 of 23 nationally available calcium carbonate products contained small amounts of lead (6459). However, the amount of lead in these supplements is substantially less than that found in common foods, such as green salads, grapes, and wine. Also, calcium significantly decreases lead absorption. Small amounts of lead in a calcium supplement would not likely be significantly absorbed or achieve clinically relevant levels in the body (6460). So far, there have not been reports of significant lead toxicity from appropriate use of calcium supplements (996).\nTreatment\nIn a case report, hypercalcemia caused by the ingestion of calcium chloride in a 66-year-old patient was treated with intravenous fluids. The gastric necrosis in this patient required a resection of the lower esophagus (104631).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCalcium absorption is affected by several factors. It varies based on age, environmental and dietary conditions, and race (1837, 8870, 38738).\n\nPeople of Asian and African descent absorb calcium more efficiently than Caucasians (1837). During menopause, calcium absorption is decreased and calcium excretion is increased. Estrogen treatment after menopause results in absorption and excretion indistinguishable from before menopause (39211). Elderly females, in general, have an impaired intestinal response to vitamin D. This impairment can further contribute to negative calcium balance and bone loss (8833, 8838). In healthy, premenopausal females, the proportion of dietary calcium absorbed varies from 10% to 60%, and is positively correlated with body mass index, dietary fat, and serum vitamin D level (6851). However not all research shows that supplementation with vitamin D improves calcium absorption. One clinical study in healthy young females shows that adding vitamin D up to 2400 IU daily to calcium does not further improve absorption of calcium (98897). Vitamin D supplementation does however seem to improve calcium absorption in postmenopausal females. One clinical study shows that vitamin D supplementation increases true fractional calcium absorption in postmenopausal females (98903).\n\nProportion of dietary calcium absorbed is inversely correlated with total dietary calcium, dietary fiber, alcohol intake, and physical activity (6851). There is a link between a low-fat, high-fiber diet and poor calcium absorption, possibly due to a faster rate of intestinal transit (6851). Protein may also impact calcium absorption (38968, 39415).\n\nThere is also a link between weight loss and calcium absorption. Weight loss of 5% or greater is associated with decreased bone mass and increased risk of fracture. Weight loss seems to decrease calcium absorption and increase parathyroid hormone. Taking calcium supplements during weight loss seems to suppress the increased bone resorption (12117, 98903). Additionally, calcium, whether derived from milk or calcium carbonate supplement, suppresses bone resorption as early as the first few hours after ingestion (113930).\n\nCalcium exhibits threshold absorption. Below the threshold, an increase in calcium intake results in improved response; above the threshold, increased calcium intake has no effect. Therefore, it is recommended that calcium should be administered in doses of 500 mg or less (1834, 8832). In general, calcium from all supplements is poorly absorbed. Taking calcium with food increases calcium absorption (8832). One clinical study using calcium tracer methodology suggests that calcium is better absorbed from a yogurt containing additional probiotics and inulin as a prebiotic than from a control yogurt without additional probiotic and prebiotic (113931). Some research suggests that calcium citrate is better absorbed than calcium carbonate (1838, 1841, 8832). Other research suggests that a specific heated oyster shell-seaweed calcium product, as well as a milk-derived calcium permeate product, might be better absorbed than calcium carbonate (1839, 1840, 113910). However, in other studies, some using a highly sensitive tracer method to assess absorption, there does not appear to be a significant difference in absorption between calcium citrate and calcium carbonate when these products are taken with a meal (1842, 15358). Preliminary evidence suggests that calcium-rich mineral waters have similar bioavailability when compared to oral calcium supplements or calcium from milk (8836, 38819, 39217). When taken in orange juice, calcium citrate malate is absorbed better than tricalcium phosphate or calcium lactate (38749).\n\nCalcium absorption is not impaired by lactose intolerance, although lactose intolerance could limit dairy calcium intake (8837). Contrary to laboratory evidence, lactose does not enhance calcium bioavailability in lactose tolerant people (4824), although it may enhance absorption in infants consuming formula (38579).\n\nCalcium absorption appears to increase from early to late pregnancy, decrease in early lactation, and then increase at weaning (38656, 38691, 39247, 39316, 39401). In premature newborns, calcium absorption may not differ between low-birthweight formulas supplemented with vitamin D, banked human milk, and banked human milk with supplemented vitamin D and calcium (38631).\nDistribution\nThe bones and teeth contain greater than 99% of the calcium in the human body. Calcium in bone is present mainly as hydroxyapatite (1834). Calcium is also present in blood, extracellular fluid, muscle, and other tissues. Calcium in bone is a reserve source of calcium that can be mobilized to maintain extracellular calcium concentrations. About half of serum calcium is bound to plasma proteins. The free or ionized calcium is tightly regulated and is a useful clinical indicator of calcium status (1834).\nExcretion\nCalcium is excreted in the urine and feces (38655, 38819, 38839, 38991, 39211, 39320). During menopause, calcium excretion is increased in the urine. However, estrogen treatment results in excretion indistinguishable from premenopausal females (39211). During lactation and late pregnancy, calcium excretion in the urine is decreased (38691, 39274). Calcium supplementation or intake from mineral water increases urinary excretion (38839, 39217). Excretion from the urine and feces is impacted by both hypokinesia and physical activity (38981, 38991). Calcium excretion is also affected by disease states, age, race, and dietary intake. Urinary excretion is increased in individuals with osteoporosis (39421) and fecal excretion is increased in children with cystic fibrosis (38522, 38655). Calcium excretion in urine is decreased when intakes of calcium are low (39318) and protein intakes are higher (38580, 38662). It is increased when foods containing calcium are consumed (31716) or with supplementation (39272, 113910). Calcium excretion in urine is decreased in adolescents when compared with adults (39248) and in Black females when compared with White females (38738). In elderly individuals, fecal excretion of calcium is decreased when protein levels are increased (39375). Age may impact the effects of protein on calcium excretion.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe bones and teeth contain greater than 99% of the calcium in the human body. Calcium in bone is present mainly as hydroxyapatite (1834). Calcium is also present in blood, extracellular fluid, muscle, and other tissues. It is essential for nerve transmission, muscle contraction, vascular contraction, vasodilation, glandular secretion, cell membrane and capillary permeability, enzyme reactions, respiration, renal function, and blood coagulation. It also plays a role in neurotransmitter and hormone release and storage, uptake and binding of amino acids, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) absorption, and gastrin secretion (15). Calcium in bone is a reserve source of calcium that can be mobilized to maintain extracellular calcium concentrations. About half of serum calcium is bound to plasma proteins. The free or ionized calcium is tightly regulated and is a useful clinical indicator of calcium status (1834).\n\nCalcium balance is generally positive during growth, neutral in the mature adult, and negative in older adults. Calcium is lost in varying amounts through the feces, urine, sweat, and sloughed skin cells. Reduced estrogen levels in women result in reduced calcium absorption and retention, increased bone turnover, and lower bone mass (1834, 8833, 8838, 8839).\nAntacid effects\nAs an antacid, calcium carbonate reacts with gastric hydrochloric acid. Calcium carbonate is the most potent antacid on a weight basis, followed by sodium bicarbonate (1843).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is interest in using calcium for cancer prevention. Preliminary evidence suggests calcium may have an antiproliferative effect on colorectal cancer cells (8820, 8870, 10019). Calcium taken orally also seems to reverse rectal epithelial hyperproliferation caused by excessive output of fecal bile acids and lipids after intestinal bypass (1826). However, population research suggests that serum calcium levels are not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (39014).\nAntidiabetes effects\nSome population research suggests that a higher intake of calcium from the diet or supplements, alone or in combination with vitamin D, is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to lower calcium intake (14265, 16713). The mechanism of action is not entirely clear. In patients without diabetes, calcium appears to improve insulin sensitivity (39363). Insulin secretion is dependent on calcium status, and vitamin D impacts the function of beta-cells by mediating calcium flux. Calcium and vitamin D may also improve glycemic control. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that supplementing with calcium 1000 mg or more daily in conjunction with vitamin D 2000 IU or more daily can lower fasting blood glucose and reduce insulin levels and insulin resistance measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) in patients without diabetes (100893).\nAntihypertensive effects\nEvidence suggests that inadequate dietary intake of calcium can play a role in the development of hypertension, stroke, and cardiovascular disease (8817, 39449). Calcium might lower blood pressure by increasing renal sodium excretion (12122). Animal research suggests that calcium can prevent salt-induced hypertension (39278). One clinical study in pregnant adults at risk for pre-eclampsia found that daily supplementation with calcium 1500 mg may lower some markers of inflammation such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, and interferon-gamma when compared with 500 mg daily, suggesting that calcium supplementation may reduce inflammation that could otherwise contribute to hypertension (113912).\nBone mineral density (BMD) effects\nIn human research, calcium appears to suppress biochemical markers of bone resorption (38721, 38949, 39257, 39406). However, this may not occur in individuals on bed rest (38996). Acute exercise increases bone resorption, which may be attenuated with pre-exercise intakes of calcium-rich foods (113935). One meta-analysis suggests that calcium fortification of food appears to have little overall effect on BMD in children and no effect on BMD in adults (107232). However, a meta-analysis of clinical trials in individuals under 35 years old shows that supplemental calcium increases BMD and bone mineral content when compared with control (113932). Additionally, clinical research in adolescents and young adults with perinatally acquired HIV shows that calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for BMD and bone turnover markers (113916, 113936).\nCholesterol-lowering effects\nCalcium may help to lower serum cholesterol levels by forming insoluble complexes with saturated fatty acids in the gut, causing them to be excreted in the feces without being absorbed (2557).\nPremenstrual effects\nIn women, calcium levels may be lower during the premenstrual period due to effects of variations in estrogen levels on calcium absorption and metabolism. This may contribute to the mood changes and other symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) (2639, 6847).\nRenal effects\nCalcium is sometimes used for patients with renal disease because it can bind with phosphate in the gut, preventing its absorption and reducing the hyperphosphatemia associated with renal failure. Calcium carbonate and calcium acetate are used for this purpose. Calcium citrate is not recommended because it increases aluminum absorption. Conversely, hypophosphatemia causes an increase in intestinal calcium absorption and increased calcium in the blood, which can inhibit formation of new bone (3372, 8821), and potentially lead to a greater risk of renal calcium stone formation (3372).\nWeight loss effects\nIt is thought that calcium could modulate diet-related adiposity by inhibiting lipogenesis, increasing lipolysis, and promoting fat loss. This effect might be due to calcium suppression of calcitriol levels, which reduces intracellular calcium in adipose cells. This leads to reduced lipogenic gene expression and increased lipolysis, resulting in overall reduced adiposity (15397). Calcium seems to repartition dietary energy from adipose tissue to lean body mass (12119). Dairy products containing calcium seem to be more effective at regulating adiposity than elemental calcium supplements, which suggests that other active constituents in dairy play a role in fat tissue regulation (12121). However, most clinical research has found that increased calcium intake does not increase weight loss (12052, 13138, 15396, 15399, 38985, 39004, 97356). A meta-analysis of 20 clinical studies shows that daily dietary and supplemental calcium intake that meets the dietary reference intake (DRI) of 1000 mg or more daily does not increase weight loss in individual with overweight or obesity when compared with intake below the DRI (95813).\nWithdrawal effects\nThere is interest in using calcium to treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Some researchers have suggested that the calcium content of acamprosate, a medication approved for use in maintenance of abstinence from alcohol, may be the active component responsible for all or part of the efficacy of acamprosate. In addition, preliminary analyses suggest that alcohol cravings may be associated with serum calcium levels (107234)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCalcium D-glucarate is the calcium salt of D-glucaric acid. It is broken down by stomach acid to form D-glucaric acid. Glucaric acid is also found in foods such as fruits and vegetables including oranges, apples, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage (772, 3952). Broccoli and potatoes provide 1.12-1.73 mg/100 grams; oranges provide up to 4.53 mg/100 grams (772). D-glucaric acid is found in tissues and body fluids, being formed by metabolism of D-glucuronic acid. It is further metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract to D-glucaro-1,4-lactone. This compound inhibits beta-glucuronidase, which is produced by colonic microflora and is associated with an increased risk of various cancers (107377).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn estrogen-dependent breast cancer, calcium D-glucarate is thought to decrease estrogen levels by increasing excretion. Estrogen is normally metabolized hepatically in phase II metabolism by combining with glucuronic acid and is then excreted in the bile. In the intestine, the bacterial enzyme beta-glucuronidase breaks the estrogen-glucuronide bond, allowing estrogen to be reabsorbed. However, the D-glucaro-1,4-lactone metabolite of calcium D-glucarate inhibits beta-glucuronidase, decreasing the amount of estrogen available for reabsorption and lowering circulating estrogen levels. There is some evidence that beta-glucuronidase activity might be increased in patients with hormone-dependent cancers like breast and prostate cancer (773, 774). Dietary glucarate can inhibit beta-glucuronidase activity and inhibits mammary tumor development in animal models (775). In vitro, D-glucarate decreases tumor cell proliferation (776).\nDetoxification effects\nCompounds such as chemical carcinogens, steroid hormones, and lipid-soluble toxins are detoxified in the liver by conjugation with glucuronic acid, before being excreted in the bile. Once in the intestine they can be deconjugated by beta-glucuronidase and become available for reabsorption. The D-glucaro-1,4-lactone metabolite of calcium D-glucarate inhibits beta-glucuronidase, decreasing deconjugation and reabsorption of toxins (107377)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe main active constituents of Calea zacatechichi include sesquiterpene lactones, such as caleicines, germacranolides (1-beta-acetoxy-zacatechinolide and 1-oxo-zacatechinolide), germacrene 7, calcine A and B, zexbrevine and analogs, budleine A and analogs, and caleochromenes A and B (23602, 23604). Other germacranolides have been isolated including calealactone C, calealactone D, and calealactone E (23606). Calea zacatechichi also contains chlorogenic, shikimic, and quinic acids and their derivatives, and flavonoids including combretol, myristicin, leuteolin, diosmetin, rhamnetin, kaempferide, kaempferol, acacetin, tangeretin, and sinensetin (106401).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn laboratory and animal research, Calea zacatechichi has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity and inhibited NF-kappa B (23601, 23605).\nAntidepressant effects\nIn animal research, Calea zacatechichi has antidepressant-like effects at doses of 0.5-50 mg/kg (106401).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animals with hyperglycemia induced by injection of glucose 50%, Calea zacatechichi decreases blood sugar levels (23603).\nAntileishmanial effects\nIn laboratory research, germacranolides isolated from Calea zacatechichi leaves and stems have antileishmanial activity (23606).\nAnxiolytic effects\nIn animal research, Calea zacatechichi has anxiolytic-like effects at doses of 0.5-50 mg/kg (106401).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn animal research, high doses of Calea zacatechichi cause salivation and vomiting (23602).\nHematologic effects\nIn vitro, an aqueous extract of Calea zacatechichi, 100 mcg/mL induces apoptosis in injured erythrocytes. In rats, doses of 8.5 mg/kg reduce platelet and leukocyte counts (105825). It is not clear if the concentrations used in these studies are clinically relevant in humans.\nHepatic effects\nIn rats, Calea zacatechichi 8.5 mg/kg is associated with a lymphoid infiltrate in liver tissue, and increases in liver enzymes (105825). It is not clear if the dose used is clinically relevant in humans.\nRenal effects\nIn rats, Calea zacatechichi 8.5 mg/kg is associated with spongiform changes in the proximal tubules of the kidneys (105825). It is not clear if the dose used is clinically relevant in humans.\nSleep effects\nIn cats, Calea zacatechichi causes somnolence, sleep, and ataxia (23602). In rats and mice, 100 mg/kg has sedative effects, increases slow wave sleep episodes, and enhances fast frequencies of the hippocampus during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (106401). In humans, Calea zacatechichi facilitates superficial sleep stages and induces short periods of light stage 1 sleep from which subjects wake up easily and frequently. Reaction times are slowed. It also produces a light hypnotic state with decreases in deep slow-wave sleep and REM sleep, and an increase in the number of dreams remembered (23602, 106401)."

Burning sensation, itching, redness, and scaling were reported rarely in patients applying a combination of calendula, licorice, and snail secretion filtrate to the face. The specific role of calendula is unclear (110322).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, calendula can cause allergic reactions. Topically, calendula can cause eczematous allergic reactions. Calendula-specific patch testing is recommended prior to usage to determine allergenic potential. Testing is particularly necessary in individuals sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family (10691, 11458, 96647). Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many other herbs. A preparation containing calendula powder 0.1% resulted in hives in a patient with a ragweed allergy (96647). Despite the widespread use of calendula and the occurrence of allergies to other family members, there has been only one report of anaphylaxis (11152).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Topical calendula has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with mild to moderate acne associated with mask wearing shows that topical application of a combination of calendula 4%, licorice root extract 0.3%, and snail secretion filtrate 40% (AI complex) to the face twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces inflammatory, but not non-inflammatory or total, acne lesions when compared with placebo. There was no difference in overall treatment success, defined as at least almost clear skin or a large improvement (110322). It is unclear if any benefits are due to calendula, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nBacterial vaginosis. It is unclear if topical calendula is beneficial for improving bacterial vaginosis.\nA small clinical study in patients with bacterial vaginosis shows that applying 5 grams of vaginal cream containing calendula flower extract before bed for one week improves vaginal burning, odor, painful urination, and painful intercourse when compared to baseline (96649). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBurns. It is unclear if oral calendula is beneficial for burn healing.\nA small clinical trial in patients hospitalized for second-degree burns shows that taking calendula 2 grams daily for 2 weeks has a large beneficial effect on wound healing when compared with placebo (110323).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral calendula has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in males aged 40-70 years with a history of smoking and stage 2 COPD shows that taking a specific combination of calendula flowers 165 mg, elderberry 165 mg, and heart's ease herb 165 mg (Inflaminat, INAT-Farma), 3 capsules daily for 6 months, modestly improves symptoms, as measured on the breathlessness, cough, and sputum scale (BCSS), and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) when compared to baseline. However, there was no improvement of COPD exacerbations or other pulmonary function tests (103629). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group. Furthermore, it is unclear if these effects are due to calendula, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nChronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Calendula in rectal suppositories has only been evaluated in combination with turmeric extract; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with CP/CPPS shows that using a rectal suppository containing turmeric extract 350 mg and calendula extract 80 mg daily for one month improves pain, peak urine flow rate, and erectile function when compared with placebo (96648). It is unclear if these effects are due to calendula, turmeric, or the combination.\nless\nConjunctivitis. Although there is interest in using topical calendula for conjunctivitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of calendula for this condition.\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if topical calendula is beneficial for improving diabetic foot ulcers.\nObservational research has found that applying a calendula hydroglycolic extract spray in addition to standard care and hygiene is associated with reduced bacterial colonization and improved odor in patients that have had a diabetic ulcer for over 3 months (93548).\nless\nDiaper rash. It is unclear if topical calendula is beneficial for improving diaper rash.\nOne preliminary clinical study in children less than 3 years of age shows that topical application of calendula 1.5% ointment three times daily for 10 days improves diaper rash when compared with aloe gel (19779). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that applying calendula 1.5% cream every 4-6 hours for 3 days improves diaper rash in fewer infants when compared to treatment with bentonite 50% mineral solution (93545, 93554).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Although there is interest in using oral calendula for dysmenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of calendula for this condition.\nGingivitis. It is unclear if using a mouth rinse with calendula is beneficial for improving gingivitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild gingivitis and bleeding gums shows that rinsing the mouth with a tincture containing calendula 25% (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Germany Home Pharmacy Pvt. Ltd.) twice daily for 6 months decreases plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding by 10% to 18% when compared to rinsing with water (93551). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with mild to moderate gingivitis and mild plaque shows that rinsing the mouth with a combination mouthwash containing a 5% extract of calendula, rosemary, and ginger for 30 seconds twice daily after food for 2 weeks decreases plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding when compared with a placebo mouthwash. The effects of this combination mouthwash appear to be similar to chlorhexidine 0.2% mouthwash (93555). It is unclear if these effects are due to calendula, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHemorrhoids. Although there is interest in using topical calendula for hemorrhoids, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of calendula for this purpose.\nLichen planus. Topical calendula has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with erosive lichen planus shows that applying a topical gel containing calendula, turmeric, and holy basil powder for 16 weeks results in 70%-100% symptom improvement in all patients compared with 0%-50% improvement in patients using placebo gel (116161). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to calendula, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the dosing is unclear.\nless\nLiver disease. Although there is interest in using oral calendula for liver disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of calendula for this condition.\nMosquito repellent. It is unclear if topical calendula essential oil helps to repel mosquitos.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying calendula 50% essential oil to the skin does not repel mosquitos as effectively as applying DEET. Mean repellency time was about 2 hours for patients applying calendula, which was shorter than the 6 hour repellency with DEET (93562).\nless\nOral leukoplakia. It is unclear if topical calendula is beneficial for improving oral leukoplakia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with oral leukoplakia shows that applying a gel containing calendula flower extract 0.2% three times daily for one month reduces lesion size by about 2 cm when compared to baseline (96650). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nOral mucositis. Calendula as a mouth rinse has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with head and neck cancer receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy shows that rinsing with 7 mL of a specific product (Faringel, Cadigroup) containing calendula powder extract 2%, propolis, aloe vera, and chamomile three times daily for 6 weeks does not prevent oral mucositis when compared with placebo (95879).\nless\nOtitis media. Topical calendula has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with otitis media shows that applying a specific combination product containing calendula, mullein, garlic, and St. John's wort in olive oil (Otikon Otic Solution, Healthy-On Ltd, Petach-Tikva, Israel), five drops into the affected ear three times daily for 3 days, may reduce ear pain when compared with baseline (39500, 39552). It is unclear if this effect is due to calendula, other ingredients, or the combination. Furthermore, due to the lack of an adequate control group, it is unclear whether the pain reduction was due to the resolution of otitis media.\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral calendula for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of calendula for this condition.\nPressure ulcers. It is unclear if topical calendula is beneficial for improving pressure ulcers.\nObservational research has found that the application of a specific calendula product (Plenusdermax) twice daily is associated with improved healing in patients with pressure ulcers that have not changed in size for at least 3 months (93549). Preliminary clinical research in hospice patients with symptomatic pressure ulcers and other wounds shows that applying a homeopathic powder (RGN107) containing calendula 0.1% and arnica 0.01% to wounds for 4 weeks is rated by the patients and caregivers to be acceptable for controlling pain, odor, and exudate when compared with baseline (96647). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical calendula reduces radiation dermatitis symptoms.\nMeta-analyses of three preliminary clinical trials in patients with breast cancer show that topical calendula does not affect the development of radiation dermatitis or the incidence of moderate to severe symptoms when compared to control (110325, 113674). In addition, a meta-analysis of two studies (39503, 93560) shows that topical calendula does not reduce the incidence of treatment interruptions due to severe symptoms of radiation dermatitis (110325). In one of the included studies, a specific calendula petroleum jelly ointment (Pommade au Calendula par Digestion, Boiron Ltd.) used twice daily during radiation therapy was found to reduce acute radiation dermatitis occurrence when compared with topical trolamine (Biafine) (39503). However, it is unclear if the benefit was due to calendula or petroleum jelly. Another clinical study used a specific calendula 10% cream in wool fat and sesame oil (Calendula Weleda, Weleda AG) twice daily during radiation therapy. This product was found to be no better than aqueous petroleum jelly cream (Essex, Schering-Plough) for reducing acute skin reactions and dermatitis symptoms of pain, burning, itching, pulling, and tenderness (93560).\nless\nVaginal atrophy. Topical calendula has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in menopausal patients with vaginal atrophy shows that use of a specific vaginal gel containing calendula, Lactobacillus sporogenes, isoflavones, and lactic acid (Estromineral Gel, Rottapharm-Madaus) daily for 4 weeks reduces vaginal itching, burning, dryness, and painful intercourse when compared with no topical treatment. Both groups also received oral isoflavones (39534). It is unclear if these effects are due to calendula, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nVaginal candidiasis. One small clinical study suggest that topical calendula is not beneficial for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying 5 grams of calendula 1% cream intravaginally once daily for 7 days effectively treats vaginal candidiasis in 34% fewer patients when compared with using clotrimazole 1% cream (93559).\nless\nVenous leg ulcers. It is unclear if topical calendula is beneficial for improving venous leg ulcers.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a calendula 7.5% ointment twice daily for 3 weeks to venous leg ulcers accelerates healing when compared with applying saline solution dressing (39509).\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if topical calendula is beneficial for improving the healing of small wounds.\nTwo small clinical trials in postpartum patients show that applying calendula ointment (formulation unspecified) to the episiotomy wound every 8 hours for 5-10 days modestly reduces pain, and seems to speed up the resolution of redness, edema, and ecchymosis, when compared with standard care, such as application of betadine solution (93550, 105087).\n\nAnother small clinical study in adults with wounds smaller than 10 cm2 on the hands and fingers shows that applying calendula flower extract 2% to the wound twice daily may modestly improve healing and epithelialization time when compared with mineral oil (107806).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate calendula for these uses.",

The flower petals contain coumarins, esculetin, scopoletin, umbelliferon (7-hydroxycoumarin), tocopherols, alpha-tocopherolquinone, and calenduloside B (19779). At least eight bioactive triterpendiol monoesters have been identified in the extracts of dried calendula flowers (39502). Calendula also contains minerals, carbohydrates, lipids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, sterols and steroids, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, tocopherols, quinones, amino acids, and resins (39529).\nAntibacterial effects\nCalendula also shows some evidence of antibacterial activity (4).\nAntiviral effects\nPreliminary data suggests that calendula may inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication (11455). Further laboratory research suggests that triterpene and flavonol glycosides isolated from calendula have some inhibitory activity against Epstein-Barr virus antigen activation (39517).\nGastrointestinal effects\nMethanolic extract of calendula flowers appears to have gastroprotective effects in animal models (39497). Crude extracts of Calendula officinalis flowers have been shown to contain both spasmolytic and spasmogenic constituents in rabbit jejunum (39514).\nHypoglycemic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that components in calendula have hypoglycemic effects (39498).\nWound healing effects\nCalendula is used for wound healing due to potential anti-inflammatory effects (39509, 39546). The faradiol monoester is believed to play an important role in the anti-inflammatory activity. Some evidence suggests the water-soluble flavonoids might also be responsible for the wound-healing effects (515). In animal models, calendula extracts combined with allantoin improved epithelialization of experimentally inflicted skin wounds (39538)."

Calotropis contains a milky latex which is irritating to the skin and eyes (95213, 95215). Although calotropis contains cardiac glycosides with known toxicity, parts of the plant have been used in traditional medicines (95214).",

Intentional or accidental exposure of the eye to calotropis, often through self-treatment or workplace exposure, has been associated with painless vision reduction involving corneal edema and Descemet folds (95213, 95214, 95215). Epithelial defects, iridocyclitis, and secondary glaucoma have also been reported in up to 31% of cases. Most symptoms resolved with appropriate treatment (95215). The latex of the calotropis plant appears to be particularly toxic to the endothelium of the cornea. In most cases, damage to the endothelial cells is permanent (95213, 95214, 95215). Damage to the eye from calotropis exposure may or may not involve pain. While most patients do not report pain, a 6-year-old boy described intense pain concurrent with epithelial damage following accidental exposure after picking the calotropis fruit (95216).\nless",

The extract of the root showed significant anti-ulcer activity against aspirin, indomethacin, ethanol, indomethacin with ethanol, or stress-induced ulcerations. This anti-ulcer activity may be attributable to the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, an inflammatory mediator (3825). Another study in rats showed that ethanolic extract of calotropis leaf improved gastric secretion, titratable acidity, ulcer index, and glutathione and malondialdehyde levels and had powerful anti-ulcer activity against stress- and other ulcerogen-induced lesions (106537). In a rat model of ulcerative colitis, total alcohol, nonpolar, and polar extracts of calotropis aerial parts improved macroscopic parameters of ulcerative colitis and the polar extracts specifically produced dose-dependent protection greater than that seen with prednisolone (106536).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, calotropis extract has demonstrated antibacterial effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (3824).

It can also be synthesized from pinene, a hydrocarbon present in turpentine oil (13442, 97261). Camphor has a characteristic odor and pungent taste (13442). Camphor was used in the 19th century as a painkiller, expectorant, counterirritant, and stimulant. It was also used to induce abortion (97261).",
            "Warnings": "Camphor products include camphorated oil (20% camphor in cottonseed oil) or camphorated spirits (10% camphor in alcohol) for topical use. Camphorated oil was removed from the US market due to cases of accidental oral toxicity in the 1980s. It continues to be available without a prescription in Canada (13442).

Even relatively dilute concentrations of camphor can irritate the nose and sinuses. However, it is difficult to determine a safe concentration of inhaled camphor. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a permissible workplace air exposure to synthetic camphor of no more than 2 parts per million (ppm) (272, 105033). It is unclear how this correlates to the exposure obtained from a camphor balm or steam bath.\nLIKELY UNSAFE when used topically on broken or injured skin.

Neurological symptoms can occur with ingestion of quantities greater than 50 mg/kg.\n\nTopically: Dermatitis and skin irritation.\n\nInhalation: Nose and sinus irritation.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nAll routes: Systemically absorbed camphor can lead to seizures, respiratory depression, coma, and death.\nCardiovascular\nCase reports of intoxication due to accidental or intentional consumption have included peripheral circulatory shock and sinus tachycardia (39649, 97261). A 54-year-old female with a history of cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation developed several episodes of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation requiring use of a defibrillator after ingestion of Vicks VapoRub, containing 4.8% camphor. She had been taking 7.5 grams of the product weekly, and took an additional 150 grams the week prior to admission. After discontinuing all camphor-containing products and receiving supportive measures, the patient's symptoms and laboratory abnormalities returned to normal (97260).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, camphor can cause significant toxicity. In more severe toxicity, general pallor and cyanosis of the lips occur (13442, 13444). Topically, camphor is not as likely to cause adverse effects. But some amount of camphor can be absorbed through intact skin. Topical use of camphor has been associated with contact eczema (13445).\n\nWarn patients not to heat products such as Vicks VapoRub in the microwave. Serious burns have occurred when the product is superheated in the microwave (13446).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, camphor can cause significant toxicity. Symptoms of camphor toxicity occur rapidly within 5-90 minutes of ingestion.

There is also a report of increased liver enzymes in an infant who received a camphor-containing topical cold remedy. The enzymes affected included aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The liver enzymes normalized after stopping the topical cold formula (4608).There is also a report of increased liver enzymes in a 35-year-old adult following \"coining\" with a balm containing camphor, which involves applying the balm and then rubbing the area with a coin until ecchymosis. The liver enzymes normalized after stopping treatment (39576). Elevated liver enzymes were also reported in a 54-year-old female after oral ingestion of Vicks VapoRub, containing 4.8% camphor. She had been taking 7.5 grams of the product weekly, and took an additional 150 grams the week prior to admission. After discontinuing all camphor-containing products and receiving supportive measures, the patient's symptoms and laboratory abnormalities returned to normal (97260).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, camphor can cause significant toxicity. Neurological symptoms occur with ingestion of greater than 50 mg/kg. These symptoms include irritability, exaggerated tendon reflexes, tonic muscular contraction, myoclonic jerks, seizures, confusion, coma, and apnea. Seizures are sometimes the first manifestation of serious toxicity (13442, 13444, 39560, 39589, 39629, 39646, 39649, 39658, 39660). In children under 6 years of age, doses as low as 700-800 mg, and possibly as low as 500 mg, have caused serious seizures, resulting in respiratory failure and death (13442, 13444, 39589). Asymptomatic patients who have ingested camphor should be observed for at least 3 hours in a hospital. A 12-hour observation period may be prudent as seizures have occurred 9 hours after ingestion in apparently recovering patients. In patients who survive, symptoms usually resolve within 24 hours, although there are reports of persistent abnormalities for days to weeks. Long-term sequelae have not been reported after resolution of symptoms (13442, 13443). In one case, a 10-year-old boy who intentionally ingested cold remedy transdermal patches containing a total of camphor 300 mg experienced mental status changes and tremulousness (39626).\n\nTopically, camphor is not as likely to cause adverse effects, but small amounts can be absorbed through intact skin. A considerable amount of camphor can also be absorbed when inhaled. Excessive use of camphor, either topically or by inhalation, can result in the development of systemic toxicity (13445, 39666). Topically and by inhalation, camphor has been associated with the occurrence of seizures. In one prospective observational study, there were 20 reports of new onset seizures and 29 reports of recurrent seizures in adults and children after use of camphor, either alone or in combination with eucalyptus oil. Most cases of seizure with topical use occurred 0.5-24 hours after topical application to the chest, neck, or face. Most cases of seizure with inhalation occurred about 2-30 minutes after steam inhalation of camphor (105028).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, camphor can cause significant toxicity. Ocular symptoms such as mydriasis and darkening of vision may occur (13442, 13444).

Metabolites of camphor are stored in fat deposits and slowly cleared (13442).\nMetabolism\nCamphor is oxidized to camphorol, which is conjugated in the liver with glucuronide (13442).\nExcretion\nMetabolites of camphor are stored in fat deposits and slowly cleared. Most camphor is excreted in the urine (13442). The half-life of camphor following 8 hours of dermal application to the arms and back is 5.6 hours in healthy adults (39601). After oral ingestion of camphor 200 mg, the elimination half-life is about 167 minutes. After oral ingestion of the same dose of camphor in Tween 80, a solvent, the half-life is about 93 minutes (105031).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of camphor are the bark and wood. Camphor was formerly obtained by distilling the bark and wood of the camphor tree. Today, camphor is typically obtained by synthetic production from turpentine oil (13442).\nAnalgesic effects\nTopically, camphor has analgesic and anesthetic properties. Preparations containing at least 3% camphor, which are often combined with other counterirritants, seem to stimulate nerve endings in the skin. This may mask deeper visceral pain with milder pain at the surface of the skin (272). Camphor appears to activate members of the mammalian transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels (39607, 39620). Pain may also be reduced due to decreased inflammation. Camphor may reduce the levels of inflammatory mediators and reduce levels of free radicals (39618).\nAntifungal effects\nIn laboratory research, camphor is active against fungal micro-organisms that cause onychomycosis such as Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Epidermophyton stockdale (13447) as well as against Candida albicans (39625).\nAntipruritic effects\nTopically, camphor has antipruritic properties. Preparations containing at least 3% camphor, which are often combined with other counterirritants, seem to stimulate nerve endings in the skin. This may mask deeper visceral pain with milder pain at the surface of the skin (272).\nRespiratory effects\nCamphor is an ingredient in topical cold preparations such as Vicks VapoRub. Some research suggests that vapors of the combination of camphor, eucalyptus, and menthol don't have any effect on nasal airflow resistance, but instead produce a cold sensation in the nose, which gives a feeling of improved breathing (13442, 39633, 39652)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of camu camu are the fruit and leaves. Camu camu fruit contains proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, fiber, vitamins, and minerals (16379). Camu camu fatty acids are 53% polyunsaturated and 36% saturated (16379). The vitamin C content is high, ranging from 1300 mg to 3000 mg per 100 grams of fruit pulp and 2000 mg to 5000 mg per 100 grams of peel (16379, 16381, 16382). Camu camu contains carotenoids, including all-trans-lutein, beta-carotene, violaxanthin, and luteoxanthin (16382). The mineral content of camu camu fruit includes potassium 839 mg/kg, calcium 157 mg/ kg, magnesium 124 mg/kg, sodium 111 mg/kg, manganese 21 mg/kg, iron 5.3 mg/kg, and zinc 3.6 mg/kg (16379). The fruit also contains flavonoids, including rutin, phenolic acids, including ellagic acid, volatile terpenes, including alpha-pinene, d-limonene, and beta-caryophyllene, terpene alcohols, including eucalyptol, fenchol, alpha-terpineol, and 4-terpineol, as well as ellagitannins, including castalagin (16380, 16383, 105518, 109628). Anthocyanins present in the fruit include cyanidin-3-glucoside and delphinidin-3-glucoside (16381, 16382). Other compounds present include alpha-calacorene, germacrene B, and palmitic acid (16383).\n\nCamu camu leaves contain the compounds ellagic acid, 4-O-methylellagic acid, and 4-(alpha-rhamnopyranosyl)-ellagic acid.\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal research in mice shows that oral administration of camu camu fruit juice reduces chemically- and thermally-induced pain (105518).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research in mice shows that oral administration of camu camu fruit juice reduces chemically-induced paw edema and local infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils (105518).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSubstances in camu camu leaves inhibit aldose reductase, which catalyzes conversion of glucose to sorbitol. The activity of this enzyme is increased in people with diabetes and may contribute to diabetic eye, nerve, and kidney complications (16377).\nAntioxidant effects\nCamu camu contains antioxidants, including vitamin C. Drinking 70 mL of 100% camu camu juice, which contains about 1050 mg vitamin C, daily for 7 days reduces levels of oxidative stress markers to a greater extent than consuming 1050 mg vitamin C in tablet form. In adult male smokers, serum levels of total reactive oxygen species, C-reactive protein, and interleukins (IL)-6 and -8 are reduced after consumption of camu camu (99403).\nAntitumor effects\nAnimal research suggests that camu camu might have antitumor effects. Camu camu enhanced the antitumor effects of the immune-checkpoint inhibitor alpha PD-1 in mouse models of breast cancer and sarcoma. Camu camu, and specifically the ellagitannin constituent castalagin, appears to have prebiotic effects. Researchers theorize that camu camu favorably modifies the gut microbiome and reprograms the tumor microenvironment (109628).\nMetabolic effects\nAnimal research suggests that camu camu might have positive effects on body weight, lipids, and glycemic control. In mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet, administration of camu camu extract prevented excessive increases in body weight, fat mass, lipid levels, and glucose levels when compared with mice fed a high-fat diet alone (109629). The mechanism of action is unclear."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn healthy volunteers, an oral cannabis-based product containing cannabidiol, delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cannabichromene in an approximate 20:1:1 ratio (Spectrum Yellow oil, Tweed Inc.), has been evaluated as a single dose or multiple doses administered every 12 hours for 7 days. Peak cannabichromene plasma concentrations occurred at 1.6-4.3 hours. For each two-fold increase in dose, the peak plasma concentration increased 1.3- to 1.8-fold. It is theorized that cannabichromene may have preferential absorption over cannabidiol and THC when administered concomitantly (107345). Research in rats shows that the time to reach the maximum serum concentration after a single dose of cannabichromene ranges from 1.5 to 3 hours. The peak serum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve exhibit dose dependent effects following single and 14-day repeated doses of cannabichromene (113098).\nDistribution\nIn mice, distribution into brain tissues is delayed relative to plasma (107347).\nExcretion\nIn mice, cannabichromene has a longer half-life in the brain than in the plasma (107347).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCannabichromene is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid. It is one of the most abundant cannabinoids in the Cannabis plant (101662). Unlike other cannabinoids, cannabichromene does not strongly affect CB1 receptors; however, it does activate CB2 receptors (89979, 107341). The nature of this activity seems to depend in part on the concentration of cannabichromene present at the receptor site (107341).\nAnalgesic effects\nThere is interest in using cannabichromene for analgesic effects in various forms of chronic pain. In animal research, cannabichromene administration seems to reduce neuropathic, heat-induced, and inflammatory pain (115788). Further, animal research suggests that cannabichromene increases analgesia by activating transient receptor potential ankyrin type-1 (TRPA1) channels, inhibiting endocannabinoid receptors, and indirectly activating adenosine 1 receptors (101652, 101656, 101657, 101664). Analgesic effects of cannabichromene seem to be more potent when used with other cannabinoids such as cannabinol (101664).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in using cannabichromene for inflammatory disease states such as colitis or rheumatoid arthritis (101660, 115787). Cannabichromene seems to have anti-inflammatory effects in most laboratory research. Some animal research shows that cannabichromene reduces inflammation in experimentally-induced paw edema and colitis models (101660, 101663). However, other research in a rheumatoid arthritis model has not shown cannabichromene to reduce inflammation or arthritis severity (115787). In vitro, cannabichromene reduces inflammation responses of activated macrophages by TRPA1 agonism and desensitization (101660). Cannabichromene also seems to mitigate or downregulate pathways involved in the expression of inflammatory compounds such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (115483, 115786). It also seems to reduce inflammation by reducing the concentration of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory channels of transient receptor potential of vanilloid type (TRPV)-1b, TRPV3 and TRPV4 in the jejunum and TRPV3 and TRPV4 in the ileum (101653).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research on dental plaque samples obtained from healthy patients with stage 1 or 2 periodontal disease shows that cannabichromene 12.5% reduces the colony count when compared with well-established synthetic toothpastes (107348).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nIn a mouse model of Dravet syndrome, cannabichromene increases the temperature threshold required for hyperthermia-induced seizures (107347).\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research shows that cannabichromene might reduce blood pressure (101659).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using cannabichromene for normalizing intestinal motility. Animal research shows that cannabichromene inhibits inflammation-induced hypermotility. The mechanism of inhibition does not seem to be affected by cannabinoid receptors or transient receptor potential ankyrin type-1 (TRPA1) (101656).\nHormonal effects\nResearch in a pre-pubescent animal model shows that cannabichromene can inhibit steroidogenesis, reducing levels of steroid hormones including testosterone, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone. Cannabichromene also seems to induce sperm abnormalities, lower sperm count, and lead to lesions and atrophy in testes and ovaries (115789).\nNeurological effects\nCannabichromene might have sedative effects. Animal research shows that cannabichromene, given as a single dose intraperitoneally, increases the sedative response to the drugs hexobarbital, barbital, and zoxazolamine. However, this effect was not maintained when cannabichromene was given continuously. After receiving cannabichromene daily for 7 days, the sedative effect of these drugs was reduced when compared with control or a single dose of cannabichromene (101655). Animal research also shows that cannabichromene might reduce respiration rate (101659).\n\nThere is interest in using cannabichromene for improving brain health by affecting neural stem cells. In vitro research shows that cannabichromene might improve viability and increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in mouse adult neural stem progenitor cells during differentiation (101661).\n\nAdditional animal research has also demonstrated anti-nociceptive and hypolocomotive effects with cannabichromene (107341).\nPsychological effects\nThere is interest in using cannabichromene for mood elevating effects. In mice models, cannabichromene was shown to reduce behavioral despair by reducing immobility in a dose-dependent manner. Since cannabichromene does not activate CB1 receptors, the mechanism for its antidepressant effects is unknown (89979).\nPulmonary effects\nIn a mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), inhaled cannabichromene reverses hypoxia, reduces ARDS-like lung destruction, and reduces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (107346)."

    "Cannabidiol (CBD)": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Cannabidiol is a non-psychoactive constituent of Cannabis sativa. Over 80 constituents, known as cannabinoids, have been identified from Cannabis sativa, of which delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the major psychoactive compound. Cannabidiol makes up around 40% of cannabis extracts (89672). Cannabidiol is typically derived from marijuana or hemp, two forms of Cannabis sativa. While marijuana often contains about 15% THC, hemp is defined by the United States federal government as containing THC levels of 0.3% or lower (99607). Cannabidiol can also be derived from other sources. Cannabidiol derived from orange peels through a process called cyclic terpene assembly is molecularly identical to cannabidiol derived from typical sources, but without the traces of THC or other impurities commonly found in cannabidiol products (106637).",
            "Warnings": "The regulatory status of cannabidiol has been changing rapidly. In 2018, the passage of the Farm Bill exempted hemp and its constituents, including cannabidiol, from the Controlled Substances Act, making it legal for sale in the United States. However, since the FDA approval of a prescription formulation of cannabidiol (Epidiolex) in 2018, it has been said that cannabidiol cannot be legally included in foods or dietary supplements (99608, 106638). However, this has been disputed and enforcement has been lacking; dietary supplements and foods containing cannabidiol are prevalent in the marketplace (89911, 99608, 106638).\n\nEpidiolex, an FDA-approved prescription solution of cannabidiol, was originally classified by the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as a schedule V controlled substance. It was de-scheduled by the DEA in April 2020 (101515).\n\nVarious commercially available cannabidiol dietary supplements have been shown to be contaminated with THC or synthetic cannabinoids (95504, 97978, 103040, 104015, 108563, 111071, 113044).\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using cannabidiol for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in adults. Cannabidiol doses up to 200 mg daily have been used with apparent safety for up to 13 weeks (97021, 105559), while higher doses of 700 mg daily for up to 6 weeks and 1200 mg daily for up to 4 weeks have been used with apparent safety (89680, 105559). A prescription cannabidiol oil (Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals) has been safely used in doses of 510-25 mg/kg daily, titrated based on response and tolerability for up to 20 months (97979, 97980, 99613, 105495, 106631, 113034). ...when a specific cannabis extract spray that contains cannabidiol 2.5 mg and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.7 mg per actuation (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is applied topically into the oral mucosa for up to 2 years. This product is available as a prescription drug in the UK and Canada; it is an investigational new drug in the US (61775, 61820, 89460, 89913, 111095).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of cannabidiol when used topically on the skin.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when a prescription cannabidiol oil (Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is used orally and appropriately. This cannabidiol product has been safely used in clinical research at doses of 2-50 mg/kg daily in children 1 year of age and older. However, the maximum recommended dosage of this product is 12.5 mg/kg twice daily (25 mg/kg/day); higher doses seem to carry a higher risk for adverse effects. Epidiolex is titrated based on response and tolerability (97017, 97018, 97019, 97022, 97025, 97979, 97980, 99613, 103038, 105495, 106631, 106633). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of other forms of cannabidiol in children.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly advises against the use of cannabidiol during pregnancy. Cannabidiol products might contain delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or other contaminants such as pesticides, heavy metals, bacteria, and fungus, which can be dangerous to the child (100891, 109172). Also, animal research shows that high levels of cannabidiol can damage the reproductive system of male offspring (100891).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, cannabidiol seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: For prescription cannabidiol (Epidiolex), somnolence in up to 30% of patients and diarrhea in up to 24% of patients. Also, decreased appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, fatigue, pyrexia, vomiting, and weight loss. Higher doses over 15-20 mg/kg daily are more likely to cause somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, liver enzyme elevations, and weight loss. Pharmacogenetic variation may also affect susceptibility to certain adverse effects, particularly diarrhea, sedation, and abnormal liver enzyme levels.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There have been rare case reports of hepatitis, respiratory depression, and pneumonia.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, cannabidiol has been associated with cardiovascular effects in some reports. In one clinical study, some patients experienced hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and lightheadedness (89700). Also, cannabidiol has also been linked to tachycardia and hypertension. In Poison Control Center reports of up to 5248 oral single-substance exposures to cannabidiol in adults and children, up to 7% of cases involved tachycardia (105493, 110248). However, the doses of cannabidiol that precipitated these reports are unclear. Other research suggests that taking cannabidiol orally does not significantly change blood pressure or heart rate when compared with placebo (61832, 89675, 89909). A case of ventricular bigeminy and a case of circulatory collapse have been considered to be related to treatment with a specific oromucosal spray that contains cannabidiol 2.5 mg and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.7 mg per actuation (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) (61759, 61820).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, cannabidiol might cause rare skin reactions (105696, 109178). In a clinical study in healthy adults, 2 cases of skin reactions, one severe and one mild, were reported (105696). These and 2 additional cases were reported in a follow-up publication specific to cannabidiol-induced skin rash (109178). The rash occurred in 4 female patients after taking oral cannabidiol 300 mg daily for up to 9 days. The earliest case started 6 hours after initial use; all rashes resolved within 5-11 days of treatment discontinuation (105696, 109178). The cannabidiol was 99.6% pure (PurMed Global; United States) and dissolved in medium chain triglyceride oil (109178). Taking the medium chain triglyceride oil alone did not reproduce symptoms. In one case, the patient required treatment with oral prednisone 0.5 mg/kg daily (109178). A systematic review of randomized controlled trials suggests that rash makes up approximately 6% of all adverse effects related to oral cannabidiol use, and one meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials in patients with epilepsy shows that taking cannabidiol is associated with about a 3-fold relative risk of rash compared with placebo (110244, 113032).\n\nTopically, cannabidiol has resulted in pain on application, as well as dryness, rash, and itching (110243).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, cannabidiol has caused dry mouth in some patients in clinical research (89700, 105559, 109177, 110245, 110249). In children and adults, cannabidiol oil has caused mild to moderate diarrhea, decreased appetite, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting. Diarrhea, decreased appetite, and weight loss or weight gain have been reported at a higher frequency with doses greater than 15-20 mg/kg daily (97017, 97019, 97021, 97022, 97025, 97979, 97980, 102323, 103031, 103042)(104884, 105493, 105495, 106631, 106633, 107327, 109176, 109177, 110248). In one case, persistent diarrhea and eosinophilic esophagitis due to cannabidiol oil were resolved with dose reduction from 20 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day in a 13-year-old female with epilepsy (113049). Weight loss also seems to be more prevalent with long-term cannabidiol use. Other adverse effects like diarrhea and vomiting also seem to be more prevalent during long-term (42-96 weeks) cannabidiol treatment when compared with short-term (about 12-14 weeks) (103034). Pharmacogenetic variation has also been shown to affect susceptibility to cannabidiol-associated diarrhea (107324). In a 75-year-old female, chronic cannabidiol use for one year was associated with microscopic colitis. Colitis resolved when cannabidiol was discontinued, and recurred after a re-challenge (104885). A systematic review of randomized controlled trials shows that gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and constipation, make up approximately 60% of all adverse effects related to oral cannabidiol use. About 17% of patients report loss of appetite (110244). However, other rare gastrointestinal events are reported. One case reports cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome that resolved completely 2 months after cessation in a teenaged male taking cannabidiol 15 mg/kg/day chronically (113040).\n\nCannabis oromucosal spray that contains cannabidiol 2.5 mg and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.7 mg per actuation (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) can cause dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, and bad taste (61759, 61764, 61820, 61896, 61909, 108698). Less commonly, this product may cause red and white buccal mucosal patches to develop inside the mouth (61820).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, cannabidiol oil has been associated with an elevation in liver transaminases and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). A meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials shows that taking cannabidiol daily is associated with approximately 5 times greater odds of DILI and 6 times greater odds of liver enzyme elevations when compared with placebo (113045). However, many patients were on concomitant medications that can also cause liver injury. A systematic review has also found that elevated liver transaminases make up about 13% of adverse effects related to cannabidiol use (110244). In another study, abnormal liver transaminases occurred in 4 of 25 patients after taking cannabidiol up to 20 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks; levels normalized within 4 weeks of study completion (109176). In an observational study, elevated liver function tests occurred in 2.7% of patients who took prescription cannabidiol oil (Epidiolex) and were the reason for discontinuation in 1 of 25 patients (113034). Pharmacogenetic variation has also been shown to affect susceptibility to liver transaminase elevations with cannabidiol use (107324).\n\nConversely, 2 large observational studies suggest that the prevalence of elevated liver transaminases in those taking cannabidiol for at least 30 days is similar when compared with the general adult population. The mean daily dose of cannabidiol used in these studies was about 50-55 mg, which is much lower than the doses reported in cases of elevated liver transaminases (107336, 113041).\n\nThe elevation in liver transaminases appears to occur more frequently at higher doses (20-25 mg/kg), in patients with elevated levels at baseline, and in patients already taking valproic acid or clobazam. While most reported elevations have been mild, some patients taking cannabidiol oil alone or with valproic acid have experienced significant elevations which required discontinuation of either valproic acid or cannabidiol (97017, 97018, 97019, 97022, 97025, 97979, 97980, 102323, 103031, 104884)(104890, 106631, 106633, 107327, 110244, 113024).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, cannabidiol has been most commonly reported to cause somnolence, sedation, dizziness, agitation, and fatigue (61989, 100883, 102323, 103031, 104884, 105493, 105495, 105559, 109177, 110245)(110248, 110249, 113024, 113034), with a significantly higher incidence when used in conjunction with clobazam (97017, 97019, 97022, 97025, 97979, 106631). Hallucinations, delusions, confusion, and slurred speech have been reported in a Poison Control Center report (110248). Other symptoms reported in clinical research include low mood, temperature dysregulation, and insomnia, although the prevalence and clinical significance is unclear (109177). Cannabidiol has been reported to cause sedation and psychomotor slowing in some patients (89700, 103029). In an observational study, sedation occurred in approximately 17% of patients who took prescription cannabidiol oil (Epidiolex) and was the reason for discontinuation in about 1 in 5 patients (113034). Pharmacogenetic variation has been shown to affect susceptibility to cannabidiol-associated sedation (107324). There is concern that cannabidiol can cause cognitive impairments when used for a long duration. However, cannabidiol does not seem to negatively impact cognition in adults with treatment-resistant epilepsy used for up to one-year (100885). Cannabis extract oromucosal spray that contains cannabidiol 2.5 mg and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.7 mg per actuation (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, sleepiness, and fatigue (61759, 61764, 61820, 61896, 61909, 96814). Additionally, a small study in healthy adults shows that consumption of brownies containing cannabidiol 640 mg plus THC 20 mg increases feelings of sedation and memory impairment when compared with brownies containing only THC 20 mg (111092). In children, cannabidiol oil has caused drowsiness, fatigue, sedation, and gait disturbance (97017, 97019, 97022, 97025).\n\nCannabidiol does not seem to be associated with withdrawal symptoms. Clinical research in healthy volunteers taking cannabidiol daily for 4 weeks shows that stopping cannabidiol abruptly does not cause withdrawal symptoms (103042).\n\nLimited research suggests that cannabidiol does not cause driving impairment. A small study has found that inhaling vaporized cannabis containing cannabidiol 13.75 mg does not increase lane weaving when compared with placebo. The lane weaving seen in those inhaling this product was equivalent to having a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.02%, which is below the lower limit of clinically relevant impairment that is considered to occur with a BAC of 0.05% (104482). Other research shows that taking a single oral dose of cannabidiol (GD Cann-C; GD Pharma Pty Ltd) 15 mg, 300 mg, or 1500 mg, confirmed to be devoid of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoids, does not affect cognitive function or driving performance after 15-240 minutes when compared with placebo (109179). The validity of these findings is limited because these studies only tested a single dose of cannabidiol, which does not mimic real-world use (104484, 109179).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOcular pain and irritation and mydriasis related to oral cannabidiol exposures have been reported in a Poison Control Center report (110248).\nless\nPsychiatric\nLimited research suggests that consuming large amounts of cannabidiol might increase the adverse effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A small study in healthy adults shows that consumption of brownies containing cannabidiol 640 mg plus THC 20 mg increases feelings of anxiety, paranoia, and irritability when compared with brownies containing only THC 20 mg (111092).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, cannabidiol oil has been associated with rare respiratory depression and increased odds of pneumonia (103029, 103031, 106631, 106633). In a case report, a 56-year-old obese male presented to the emergency room with severe respiratory depression 3 hours after consuming two packages of gummies labeled to contain cannabidiol 370 mg. Symptoms included respiratory acidosis, slurred speech, bradycardia, and vomiting. The patient was treated with supportive care (103029). It is uncertain whether these effects were caused by cannabidiol or other adulterant substances in the gummies.\n\nA small clinical trial in patients with cancer found that taking cannabidiol (GD-Cann C, Norwood, South Australia) in median doses of 400 mg daily for up to 2 weeks results in an increased number of patients with dyspnea when compared with placebo (110247).\n\nUsing a specific oromucosal spray that contains cannabidiol 2.5 mg and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 2.7 mg (THC) per actuation (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) may cause pharyngitis, hoarseness, and throat irritation (61759).\nless\nOther\nThere is some concern that cannabidiol could be used as a substance of abuse. Cannabidiol derived from marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Epidiolex, an approved prescription formulation of cannabidiol, is classified as a schedule V controlled substance (99606). In a clinical study of healthy recreational polydrug abusers, a single dose of cannabidiol 750 mg was rated no differently than placebo for drug-liking, likelihood of repeat use, or the occurrence of positive effects, such as feeling high or feeling stoned. However, a single dose of cannabidiol 1500 mg or 4500 mg scored higher for likelihood of repeat use and occurrence of positive effects when compared with placebo, although these ratings were lower than those for dronabinol and alprazolam (99605).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nEpilepsy. A specific prescription cannabidiol product, Epidiolex (GW Pharmaceuticals), is FDA-approved for use in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex. It is unclear if other cannabidiol products are beneficial for these conditions.\nResearch into the use of cannabidiol for the treatment of epilepsy has primarily been conducted with a specific oil-based solution, Epidiolex. This product is FDA-approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis complex in patients 1 year of age and older (99613). Prescription cannabidiol is typically used as an adjunctive treatment to conventional anti-epileptic medicines such as clobazam, valproic acid, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and rufinamide. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome shows that cannabidiol daily for 14 weeks must be used by 4 patients taking antiepileptic treatment regimens with clobazam, and 8 patients taking antiepileptic regimens without clobazam, to result in one additional patient achieving a 50% greater reduction in seizures (103037). Research suggests that Epidiolex maintains efficacy when used long-term (105495, 106631, 106633). A prospective open-label study in adults and children with treatment-resistant epilepsy suggests that taking Epidiolex for 2 years results in sustained seizure reduction when compared with baseline (105495).\n\nFor patients with Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, reduced seizure frequency tends to occur within 2-4 weeks of starting treatment with Epidiolex (97017, 97979, 97980, 106632). Clinical research in children 2-18 years of age with refractory Dravet syndrome shows that taking Epidiolex 20 mg/kg daily for 14 weeks reduces total convulsive seizure frequency by 39%, compared to 13% with placebo (97017). Up to 50% of patients with Dravet syndrome experience at least a 50% reduction in convulsive seizures after taking Epidiolex for 12-14 weeks. An open-label extension study shows similar reductions in total convulsive seizure frequency sustained through 156 weeks of treatment at a mean modal dose of 22 mg/kg daily, with more than 45% of patients experiencing at least a 50% reduction in convulsive seizures at each 12-week visit window (106633). Epidiolex seems to be effective at daily doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, but lower doses seem to be better tolerated (97017, 97022, 103038, 106633). Clinical research in patients 2-43 years of age with refractory Lennox-Gastaut syndrome shows that taking Epidiolex for 14 weeks reduces the frequency of drop seizures by up to 43%, which is significant when compared with placebo (97979, 97980). An open-label extension study in these patients shows similar reductions in drop seizures sustained through 156 weeks of treatment at a mean modal dose of 24 mg/kg daily (106631). A clinical trial in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) shows that taking Epidiolex 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg daily for 16 weeks reduces seizure frequency by 30% or 29%, respectively, when compared with placebo (104888). An open-label extension study in these patients shows seizure frequency reductions of 54% to 68% sustained through 48 weeks of treatment at a mean modal dose of 27 mg/kg daily, with more than 53% of patients experiencing at least a 50% reduction in seizures (107327).\n\nOther cannabidiol products also have been evaluated for use in the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, including Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. A small, nonrandomized, open-label clinical study in children and adolescents 3-18 years of age with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy receiving a stable antiseizure regimen shows that application of a cannabidiol 4.2% gel, delivering cannabidiol 125-500 mg twice daily decreases monthly seizure frequency by 12% when compared with baseline. Seizure types demonstrating the greatest response included focal impaired awareness seizures (previously called complex partial seizures) and tonic-clonic seizures (106630). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nCannabidiol has also been evaluated for its effects on interictal epileptiform activity in children with treatment-resistant epilepsy. A small clinical study shows that taking cannabidiol, either as Epidiolex or another pharmaceutical grade formulation of synthetic cannabidiol, 20 mg/kg daily for 3 months reduces the rate of interictal epileptiform discharges from 37 per minute to 20 per minute when compared with baseline (107330). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nEpidiolex has also been evaluated for use in other forms of epilepsy such as Sturge-Weber syndrome, febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), and epileptic encephalopathy of genetic origin; however, the available research is limited, and it is not approved for these uses (97019, 97020, 97022, 97025, 99603, 99604, 100883, 100889, 103034).\n\nLimited research has also evaluated pharmaceutical-grade, synthetically-derived cannabidiol products. One open-label observational study in children and adults with refractory epilepsy has found that taking a specific synthetic cannabidiol product (THC Pharm GmbH) for 3 months reduces median motor seizure frequency by 40% and median seizure frequency per month by 10.5 when compared with baseline (102323). Another small, observational open-label study in children 6-36 months of age with refractory infantile spasms shows that taking a specific synthetic cannabidiol product (Insys Development Company) for 14 days does not reduce spasms when compared with baseline (102324).\n\nThe effect of a topical cannabidiol product has also been investigated in adults with drug-resistant focal seizures. One clinical study shows that topical application of cannabidiol 97.5 mg or 195 mg twice daily for 12 weeks is no more effective than placebo for reducing seizure frequency. However, in an open-label extension, doses of 195 mg or 390 mg twice daily resulted in about 61% of patients achieving a seizure reduction of at least 50%; benefits were maintained for at least 18 months (109173).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnxiety. It is unclear if cannabidiol is beneficial for reducing test-related or other forms of anxiety.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with treatment-resistant anxiety shows that taking cannabidiol titrated from 200 mg daily up to 800 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces the severity of anxiety by 43% from baseline. There were also modest improvements in symptoms of depression. However, benefits were not maintained at a 6-month follow-up (109177). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. Additionally, the patients in this study were heterogenous, with almost 50% having social anxiety alone, and 40% having social anxiety in combination with other types of anxiety such as generalized anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder. Similarly, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with elevated trait worry shows that taking cannabidiol 300 mg daily for 2 weeks improves self-reported scores related to anxiety symptoms when compared with placebo but does not improve scores assessing the severity of worry (113035). However, other preliminary clinical research in college students who self-report moderate to severe test anxiety shows that taking a single dose of cannabidiol 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg does not reduce symptoms when compared with placebo (109185). This study may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups.\n\nSublingual cannabidiol has also been investigated. A small clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe anxiety shows that sublingual use of a solution providing cannabidiol 9.97 mg three times daily for 4 weeks modestly improves symptoms of anxiety, as well as sleep, quality of life, and some measures of cognition when compared with baseline. All patients responded to treatment. This product also contained low levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), providing a total of 0.69 mg daily, as well as cannabichromene, cannabigerol, and cannabinol (110245).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nA very small crossover study in endurance trained males undergoing a 60-minute run followed by a run to exhaustion suggests that taking a single dose of cannabidiol 300 mg (GD Cann®-C; GD Pharma Pty Ltd) 90 minutes before exercise does not improve athletic performance, and may increase oxygen consumption, when compared with placebo (108557). However, this study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, the washout period of 7 days may have been insufficient, as most individuals had detectable CBD levels during the crossover portion of this study.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if topical cannabidiol is beneficial for reducing eczema symptoms.\nA small observational study in adults with eczema has found that applying a gel containing cannabidiol 1% in dimethicone and polysilicone-11 for 14 days modestly reduces overall symptoms and pruritus severity when compared with baseline (105498). This study is limited by its observational nature, short duration, and the lack of a control group.\nless\nBipolar disorder. Although there has been interest in using cannabidiol for bipolar disorder, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cannabidiol for this purpose.\nCachexia. Oral cannabidiol has only been evaluated as a component of a cannabis extract; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study in patients with cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome shows that using a cannabis extract standardized to contain delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.5 mg and cannabidiol 1 mg twice daily for 6 weeks does not increase appetite when compared with placebo (61785). However, the substantial placebo effect and dropout rate in this study limits the reliability of these findings.\nless\nCancer-related fatigue. More research is needed to determine if non-inhaled cannabidiol is beneficial in patients with cancer-related pain that is not adequately controlled with standard treatment.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking cannabidiol (GD-Cann C, Norwood, South Australia) for 2 weeks does not improve tiredness or drowsiness when compared with placebo. The dose of cannabidiol started at 50 mg once daily and was titrated every third day up to a maximum of 200 mg three times daily (110247).\nless\nCancer-related pain. More research is needed to determine if non-inhaled cannabidiol is beneficial in patients with cancer-related pain that is not adequately controlled with standard treatment.\nIn 2021, the British Medical Journal published a clinical practice guideline for the use of medical cannabis and cannabinoids for chronic pain. This guideline states that the evidence weakly supports a trial of cannabinoids in conjunction with standard pain management in individuals with moderate to severe chronic pain and insufficient pain relief. Trials should begin with a low dose of cannabidiol titrated to effect, followed by the gradual addition of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), with a maximum daily dose of cannabidiol 40 mg and THC 40 mg (108698). This recommendation is based on evidence from 4 systematic reviews of research conducted in patients with various forms of chronic pain, including cancer-related pain, which suggest that using non-inhaled THC or cannabidiol for 1-4 months may modestly improve pain, physical function, and sleep, but not emotional, role, or social functions, when compared with standard treatment alone (108674). However, a meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in patients with chronic, cancer-related pain receiving prescription opioids shows that using a specific oromucosal cannabis spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals), standardized to contain cannabidiol 2.5 mg and THC 2.7 mg per spray, for 2-5 weeks does not improve prescribed opioid consumption, sleep, or pain, and actually increases nausea and vomiting by 43% and 50%, respectively, when compared with opioids alone (108676, 111095). All studies instructed patients not to alter the prescribed opioid dose, which may have increased the risk for adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. A small and preliminary clinical trial shows that taking cannabidiol (GD-Cann C, Norwood, South Australia) alone for 2 weeks does not reduce pain or opioid use when compared with placebo. The dose of cannabidiol started at 50 mg once daily and was titrated every third day up to a maximum of 200 mg three times daily (110247). More research is needed on the effect of cannabidiol alone.\nless\nCanker sores. It is unclear if topical cannabidiol is beneficial for recurrent canker sores.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with recurrent canker sores shows that applying a cannabidiol 0.1% patch three times daily for 7 days reduces ulcer size and accelerates ulcer healing at day 7 when compared with placebo (113052). The interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of a statistical comparison to the active control group that received topical triamcinolone cream.\nless\nCannabis use disorder. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for reducing cannabis use in patients with cannabis use disorder.\nA small clinical study in patients with moderate cannabis use disorder shows that taking synthetic cannabidiol oil (STI Pharmaceuticals) 400 mg or 800 mg in two divided doses daily for 4 weeks seems to reduce overall cannabis consumption, as measured by 11-nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) urine levels, when compared with placebo. The 400 mg dose, but not the 800 mg dose, also seems to increase self-reported abstinence from cannabis by about 0.5 days per week when compared with placebo. A 200 mg daily dose demonstrated no effect (104500). An observational study in a small number of patients with cannabis use disorder has found that vaping cannabidiol daily for 12 weeks is associated with an approximately 50% reduction in daily cannabis use from baseline in 30% of patients. The mean amount of inhaled cannabidiol was 215.8 mg daily; however, dosing was increased at each visit based on withdrawal symptoms and cravings. All patients also used nicotine 6 mg/ml due to co-consumption of tobacco (109175). However, this study was small and uncontrolled and more than 50% of patients were lost to follow-up by 10 weeks.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if a cannabis oromucosal spray or oral cannabis extract, providing standard doses of cannabidiol in combination with other ingredients, is beneficial for the prevention of CINV.\nA small clinical study in patients receiving moderate-to-high emetogenic chemotherapy and still experiencing CINV despite conventional antiemetic prophylaxis shows that taking a cannabis extract (TN-TC11M) containing cannabidiol 2.5 mg and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.5 mg three times daily during chemotherapy days 1-5 prevents CINV in 25% of patients, compared with 14% of patients receiving usual care. This means that 9 patients must be treated with this extract in order to prevent one case of CINV (104489). Limited research has also evaluated a cannabis oromucosal spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) standardized to contain cannabidiol 2.5 mg and THC 2.7 mg per actuation. A very small clinical study shows that, when used in addition to a standard antiemetic regimen, 1-3 sprays after each daily chemotherapy infusion and then up to 8 sprays every 4 hours as needed for 4 days, prevents delayed CINV in 71% of patients, compared with only 22% of patients in the placebo group. There was no between-group difference in the occurrence of acute CINV, which was low in both groups (96814). This study is limited due to its small size and non-standardized treatment regimens. The effect of pure cannabidiol alone is unclear.\nless\nChemotherapy-related taste changes. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for improving taste- related changes from chemotherapy.\nA small clinical trial in patients receiving paclitaxel- or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy shows that taking cannabidiol 300 mg daily for 8 days during each cycle of chemotherapy improves the ability to differentiate between weak or strong degrees of saltiness and sweetness at the third cycle of chemotherapy when compared to baseline (113029). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of a statistical comparison to the control group.\nless\nCocaine dependence. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for reducing anxiety in patients with cocaine use disorder.\nAn exploratory study in adults with severe cocaine use disorder, most of whom have an additional substance use disorder, shows that taking up to 800 mg of cannabidiol daily for 12 weeks does not improve overall anxiety, cortisol levels, or anxiety after a stressful cocaine-cue exercise when compared with placebo (108561). The validity of this finding is limited due to the high dropout rate of participants (36%); additionally, other substances such as cannabis, alcohol, opioids, and other stimulants were used by patients during the study period.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral, sublingual, or inhaled cannabidiol improves cognitive function in healthy adults.\nMost clinical research shows that cannabidiol does not improve cognitive function. However, the evidence is mixed, and most studies are small. A small clinical trial in patients with cannabis use disorder shows that taking cannabidiol 400 mg or 800 mg daily for 4 weeks does not improve most measures of cognitive function when compared to placebo (110251). Also, another small clinical trial in young, healthy adults shows that taking a single dose of cannabidiol 300 mg (Zatural, Eden, Idaho) does not improve most measures of cognition after 2 hours when compared with placebo (110250). Sublingual cannabidiol has also been investigated. A small, preliminary clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe anxiety shows that sublingual use of a solution providing cannabidiol 9.97 mg three times daily for 4 weeks modestly improves some measures of cognition when compared with baseline. This product also contained small amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), providing a total of 0.69 mg daily, as well as small amounts of cannabichromene, cannabigerol, and cannabinol (110245). An observational study has found that working memory performance is similar among users and non-users of cannabidiol (107335).\n\nThe effect of inhaled cannabidiol has also been investigated. A small clinical study in healthy young adults shows that vaping a single dose of cannabidiol 5% over 15 minutes for a total dose of 12.5 mg modestly improves episodic memory performance, but not attention or working memory performance, when compared with placebo (107326).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A small clinical study suggests that oral cannabidiol is not beneficial in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.\nA clinical study in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking cannabidiol 300 mg daily for 14 days has no effect on clinical deterioration when compared with placebo. Additionally, the median time to symptom resolution was 12 days in those receiving cannabidiol, compared with 9 days in those receiving placebo (107331).\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for Crohn disease.\nA small clinical study in adults with Crohn disease shows that taking cannabidiol oil 10 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not alter disease activity or C-reactive protein levels when compared with placebo (97026). An additional small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate Crohn disease shows that using a cannabis oil containing cannabidiol 16% and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 4% , titrated gradually to satisfactory response to a maximum of cannabidiol 160 mg twice daily before meals for 8 weeks, in conjunction with standard care such as corticosteroids, improves patient satisfaction and some symptoms such as abdominal pain and number of daily bowel movements, but does not improve disease activity scores or endoscopic findings, when compared with placebo (108678).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for behavioral and mood symptoms in dementia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with dementia shows that taking cannabis oil (Avidekel, Tikun-Olam Cannbit Pharmaceuticals) providing cannabidiol 295 mg/mL and THC 12.5 mg/mL three times daily for 16 weeks results in a clinically significant reduction in agitation in 50% of patients, compared with only 15% of those taking placebo. Cannabidiol was titrated from one drop to 21 drops per administration over the first 6 weeks; the average intake of cannabidiol during the final 10 weeks of the study was 527.5 mg daily (109187). In contrast, a very small clinical study in patients with dementia shows that taking full spectrum hemp extract cannabidiol (Care Drops, Kannabio) 3% titrated to 10 drops per day for 6 months does not improve scores regarding behavior and mood symptoms when compared with usual care and adjusting for baseline differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms between groups (113023).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for glucose and lipid management in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nA small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes conducted in Iran shows that taking a specific product containing cannabidiol 100 mcg and delta-9-tetrahydracannabinol 10 mcg (CBDEX10, Yas Daru) 2 puffs twice daily for 8 weeks modestly improves fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with placebo, but does not increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (113056). Conversely, a small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking cannabidiol 100 mg twice daily for 13 weeks does not improve plasma lipid levels, glycemic parameters, or markers of inflammation when compared with placebo (97021).\nless\nDyspepsia. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for dyspepsia.\nA small clinical trial in patients with functional dyspepsia and normal gastric emptying shows that taking cannabidiol 10 mg/kg twice daily for 4 weeks does not reduce symptoms or improve gastric function when compared with placebo. Dosing started at 1.25 mg/kg twice daily and increased by daily doses of 2.5-5 mg/kg every other day, to a final total daily dose of 20 mg/kg (109176).\nless\nDystonia. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for dystonia of various etiologies.\nA very small clinical study shows that taking cannabidiol 100-600 mg daily for 6 weeks improves dystonia by 20% to 50% when compared to baseline in patients with Meige syndrome, levodopa-induced dystonia, or primary dystonia (89700). However, the lack of a comparator group limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nEssential tremor. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial in adults with this condition.\nA small clinical study in patients with essential tremor shows that taking a single oral dose of cannabidiol 300 mg does not reduce the severity of upper limb tremors at 60 or 210 minutes after ingestion when compared with placebo (104887).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol helps to reduce muscle damage from exercise in untrained males.\nA small clinical study in healthy, untrained males shows that taking cannabidiol oil 150 mg (Green Roads) in two divided doses daily for 4 days prior to performing maximal-strength muscle contractions does not affect muscle soreness, peak torque, arm circumference, or hanging joint angle when compared with placebo (104499). Also, a small clinical crossover study in 24 well-trained females shows that taking cannabidiol does not benefit performance or fatigue at 4 and 48 hours after strenuous eccentric exercise when compared with placebo. Cannabidiol 5 mg/kg was taken 2 hours prior, immediately after, and 10 hours after exercise (109180). Another small clinical crossover study in 16 healthy, trained athletes shows that taking a single cannabidiol dose of 60 mg after intensive strength training attenuates increases in creatine kinase and myoglobin levels and improves recovery of squat performance, but not countermeasure jump and reach test performance, after 72 hours when compared with placebo (106634).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Cannabidiol has only been studied in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in exercise-trained adults shows that taking cannabidiol 70 mg combined with cannabigerol 50 mg, beta caryophyllene 25 mg, branched-chain amino acids 3.8 grams, and magnesium citrate 420 mg twice daily for 3.5 days does not improve self-reported muscle soreness or functional aspects of recovery when compared with placebo (113050).\nless\nFibromyalgia. Inhaled cannabidiol has only been evaluated as a component of a cannabis extract; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in female adults with fibromyalgia and chronic pain shows that a single vapor inhalation of cannabis containing cannabidiol 17.8 mg and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 13.4 mg does not improve pain, electrical pain thresholds, or spontaneous pain scores when compared with placebo (101420).\nless\nFragile X syndrome. It is unclear if topical cannabidiol is beneficial in children with this condition.\nA small clinical study in children with fragile X syndrome shows that applying cannabidiol gel to the skin twice daily for 12 weeks, titrated from a daily dose of 50 mg up to 250 mg, improves anxiety and behavioral symptoms such as hyperactivity, compulsiveness, and social avoidance when compared to baseline (100880). The validity of these results is limited by a lack of comparator group. A more recent clinical trial in children with fragile X syndrome given standard care shows that applying this product to the skin for 12 weeks does not improve social avoidance-related behavior when compared with placebo. However, in a sub-group of children at risk of the most severe symptoms, social and disruptive behaviors were modestly improved. The dose was 250 mg daily, or 500 mg daily for those over 35 kg (110243).\nless\nGastroparesis. It is unclear if cannabidiol is beneficial for gastroparesis.\nA small clinical study in patients with gastroparesis shows that taking cannabidiol 10 mg/kg twice daily for 4 weeks improves scores for global gastroparesis symptoms, ability to finish a full-sized meal, and number of vomiting episodes when compared with placebo, but does not improve measured gastric volumes (113054). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by the subjectivity of self-reported outcomes.\nless\nGraft-versus-host disease (GVHD). It is unclear if cannabidiol prevents or delays GVHD.\nA small prospective cohort study in adults receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplant has found that taking cannabidiol oil 150 mg twice daily, starting 7 days before transplantation and continuing for 30 days thereafter, in conjunction with standard GVHD prophylaxis, is associated with delayed development of grades II-IV GVHD prior to day 100, but not 12 months, when compared to historical controls. The median time to onset of GVHD was 60 days for those receiving cannabidiol and 20 days for the control group. All patients in this study had a 10/10 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched or 1-antigen-mismatched related or unrelated donor (97024).\nless\nHuntington disease. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with Huntington disease shows that cannabidiol 10 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks does not improve chorea severity or other symptoms when compared with placebo (61832).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for hypertension.\nA moderate-size crossover study in adults with mild to moderate untreated or treated hypertension shows that taking a specific cannabidiol product (DehydraTECH 2.0, Lexaria Bioscience), starting at 225-300 mg and titrating to 375-450 mg over 2.5 weeks, typically split in 2-3 doses daily for a total of 5 weeks, reduces systolic blood pressure by approximately 5 mmHg and 24-hour mean arterial pressure by approximately 3 mmHg when compared to baseline (113031). However, interpretation of these findings is limited by the lack of a statistical comparison to the placebo group. Similarly, another small crossover study in adults with untreated hypertension shows that taking cannabidiol 150 mg every 8 hours for 1 day reduces systolic blood pressure by approximately 5 mmHg and arterial blood pressure by approximately 3 mmHg when compared with placebo (113030). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by the short study duration and circadian fluctuations in blood pressure. A very small study in older adults with hypertension shows that taking cannabis oil containing 2% to 20% cannabidiol and 1% to 10% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) , for an average total daily dose of about 21 mg of each cannabinoid, seems to modestly reduce blood pressure when compared with baseline (104480). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group and the non-standardized formulations and dosing used.\nless\nInsomnia. Oral cannabidiol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical trial in adults with self-reported poor or very poor sleep shows that taking gummies containing cannabidiol 10 mg, 20 mg, or 100 mg combined with 20 mg of cannabinol daily for 7 days does not improve sleep quality, sleep onset, unintended waking after sleeping, or daytime fatigue when compared with placebo (113055). Additionally, a crossover clinical trial in patients with self-reported insomnia shows that using an investigational drug (ZLT-101; Zelira Therapeutics) containing cannabidiol 1 mg/mL, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 20 mg/mL, and cannabinol 2 mg/mL, taken as 0.5-1 mL sublingually one hour before sleep for 2 weeks, improves symptom severity and total sleep time when compared with placebo (108677). The interpretation of the findings in both studies is limited by the short duration of treatment. Another very large clinical trial in adults with sleep disturbance shows that taking cannabidiol 15 mg alone or in varied combinations with cannabinol, cannabichromene, or melatonin daily over 4 weeks improves sleep quality when compared to baseline. However, the odds of achieving a clinically important difference in sleep quality is not improved when cannabidiol alone is compared with combination therapy or with melatonin 5 mg alone (113051). It is unclear if these effects are from cannabidiol, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for improving pain in IBS.\nA small clinical study in adults with IBS shows that chewing gum containing cannabidiol 50 mg for at least 30 minutes while experiencing moderate to severe pain, as needed but not exceeding 6 times daily, over 3 weeks does not reduce abdominal pain when compared with a placebo gum (105558). This study is limited by small size and low reported use of the gum intervention due to the difficulty of chewing for the minimum required duration of 30 minutes.\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if cannabidiol is beneficial for post-ureteroscopy pain.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults undergoing ureteroscopy with stent placement for kidney and ureteral stones receiving standard treatment with tamsulosin, oxybutynin, and phenazopyridine shows that taking cannabidiol 20 mg daily for 3 days does not reduce pain or opioid usage when compared with placebo (113048).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). A specific cannabis oromucosal spray and oral cannabis extract, providing standard doses of cannabidiol in combination with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), seems to modestly reduce spasticity in patients with MS. The effect of cannabidiol alone on symptoms of MS is unclear.\nMeta-analysis of several clinical studies in patients with MS shows that using a specific oromucosal spray containing cannabis extract (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals), standardized to deliver cannabidiol 2.5 mg and THC 2.7 mg per actuation, for at least 3 weeks modestly reduces subjective spasticity, but does not seem to reduce neuropathic pain or bladder dysfunction, when compared with placebo (104895). Another meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies, that includes many of the same studies as the prior meta-analysis, shows that using Sativex as add-on therapy improves the likelihood of reduced spasticity by 2.4 times when compared with placebo (113020). Limited research suggests that the benefit of Sativex might last for over 11 months and withdrawal of Sativex may cause a rebound of MS symptoms (89923, 89924). Sativex has been approved in the United Kingdom as a prescription medicine to treat MS-related spasticity (89913) and in Canada to treat neuropathic pain associated with MS (61775). This product has not been approved in the United States. The American Academy of Neurology states that Sativex does not improve objective measures of spasticity, reduce the number of urinary incontinence episodes, or reduce MS-related tremors (89460). Notably, much of the research was funded by the manufacturer.\n\nOther oral cannabis extracts containing cannabidiol have also been studied. A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with MS shows that taking a cannabis extract containing cannabidiol 8-18 mg and THC 25-30 mg daily for up to 15 weeks modestly reduces subjective spasticity, neuropathic pain, and bladder dysfunction when compared with placebo. However, objective spasticity measures (Ashworth scale) were not improved when compared with placebo (104895).\n\nRecent clinical practice guidelines for the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for the management of chronic pain strongly recommend the use of cannabinoid-based medicines as adjunct treatment for improvement of pain, muscle spasm, and sleep in patients with MS and inadequate response to other treatments. These recommendations are based on low or moderate quality evidence of smoked cannabis, cannabis extract, and oromucosal cannabidiol/THC, suggesting that benefits exceed the risks of non-serious adverse effects. The strongest evidence of benefit has been shown with oils and capsules, as opposed to smoking or oromucosal formulations. The evidence related to cannabidiol-predominant formulations for this purpose is unclear (110321).\nless\nNeuropathic pain. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for neuropathic pain.\nClinical research shows that taking cannabidiol up to 50 mg alone or with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) up to 25 mg in two divided doses daily for 8 weeks does not reduce neuropathic pain of various etiologies or use of analgesics, when compared with placebo (110249).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if an oral cannabidiol-rich hemp oil extract helps to improve weight loss.\nA small clinical study in healthy overweight adults shows that taking a specific hemp oil extract (PlusCBD Extra Strength Hemp Extract) as 60 mg, providing 15 mg cannabidiol, daily for 6 weeks, does not reduce weight or body mass index when compared with placebo (103805). This study is limited due to its exploratory nature and because it did not control for dietary changes.\nless\nOpioid withdrawal. It is unclear if cannabidiol is beneficial for reducing cravings associated with heroin use disorder.\nA small clinical study in drug-abstinent adults with heroin use disorder shows that taking a specific oil-based solution (Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals) of cannabidiol 400 or 800 mg daily for 3 days reduces cue-induced craving and anxiety acutely and for 7 days after the last cannabidiol dose when compared with placebo (99491). This study was limited by its small sample size and subjective primary outcomes. Furthermore, it is not clear if cannabidiol can prevent heroin use disorder relapse.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral or topical cannabidiol is beneficial for improving pain in patients with osteoarthritis.\nA clinical study in adults with joint disease, including hand osteoarthritis, and moderate pain intensity shows that adjunctive therapy with synthetic cannabidiol 20-30 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve pain intensity in the previous 24 hours when compared with placebo (106635). However, a small clinical crossover trial in patients with thumb basal joint arthritis shows that topical cannabidiol 6.2 mg in shea butter twice daily for 2 weeks modestly improves pain and disability, but not strength, when compared with a shea butter placebo (109183).\nless\nPain (acute). Small clinical studies suggest that a single dose of oral cannabidiol does not reduce acute pain.\nA clinical trial in adults presenting to the emergency department with acute low back pain shows that taking a single dose of cannabidiol (GD Pharma) 400 mg in a 4 mL oil solution, in addition to the standard treatment of acetaminophen 1000 mg with ibuprofen 400 mg, does not reduce pain, length of hospital stay, or need for rescue analgesia with oxycodone over 2 hours when compared with placebo (105492).\n\nSingle doses of cannabidiol also do not seem to reduce experimentally-induced acute pain. Small clinical studies in healthy volunteers shows that taking a single dose of cannabidiol 800-1600 mg as an oil-solution 30-60 minutes prior to electrically-induced pain does not reduce acute pain intensity, hyperalgesia, or allodynia when compared with placebo (105500, 108560). Another small clinical trial in healthy volunteers shows that taking a single dose of cannabidiol 200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg does not reduce pain severity or improve pain tolerance while submerging the left hand in cold water every hour for 8 hours when compared with placebo (105595).\nless\nPain (chronic). It is unclear if oral or topical cannabidiol is beneficial for chronic pain.\nA small observational cohort study suggests that taking cannabidiol for 8 weeks is associated with reduced opioid use, as well as improved chronic pain and sleep quality (104498). Additionally, a small observational study in former professional athletes with chronic pain suggests that applying cannabidiol 10 mg in combination with lemongrass, ylang ylang, wintergreen, and camphor to affected extremities twice daily for 6 weeks is associated with improved self-reported pain scores and pain-related disability compared to baseline (113037). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group and a 30% dropout rate. It is also unclear if these effects are from cannabidiol, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nRecent clinical practice guidelines for the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for the management of chronic pain strongly recommend the use of cannabinoid-based medicines alone and/or as adjunct treatment for improvement of pain and in individuals with chronic pain not responsive to, or intolerant of, non-pharmacologic treatment. The guidelines indicate that cannabidiol-dominant products can be used in combination with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in order to reduce adverse events; however, the strongest evidence of benefit comes from oral or inhaled formulations rich in THC, not cannabidiol. The evidence related to cannabidiol-predominant formulations for this purpose is unclear (110321).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if cannabidiol is beneficial for improving symptoms or reducing psychosis in adults with this condition.\nA small clinical study in adults with Parkinson disease shows that taking a single dose of cannabidiol 300 mg attenuates anxiety and reduces tremor during a simulated public speaking test when compared with placebo (102328). Another very small study in adults with Parkinson disease and psychosis shows that taking flexible-dose cannabidiol starting at 150 mg daily for 4 weeks improves psychotic symptoms when compared to baseline (89689). Also, a small clinical study shows that taking cannabidiol (Epidiolex) titrated from 5 mg/kg to 20-25 mg/kg daily for 10-15 days reduces disease severity by 18% and movement disorders by 25% when compared to baseline (104884). The lack of comparator groups limits the validity of these findings. Conversely, a small clinical study in adults with Parkinson disease conducted in Thailand shows that taking sublingual cannabidiol-enriched cannabis extract, approximately 16 mg, daily for 6 weeks after a 2-week titration does not improve validated Parkinson disease rating scores, anxiety, or depression when compared with placebo (113039). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by the use of lower dosages of cannabidiol and subjective outcomes.\nless\nPeripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for neuropathic pain.\nClinical research in patients with neuropathic pain, mainly peripheral neuropathy, shows that taking cannabidiol up to 50 mg daily alone or with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) up to 25 mg daily in two divided doses daily for 8 weeks does not reduce pain or use of analgesics, when compared with placebo (110249). A small clinical study in adults with peripheral neuropathy of various etiologies shows that applying a specific emu oil product (Theramu Relieve, Theramu) containing cannabidiol, camphor, and eucalyptus leaf oil to symptomatic areas for 4 weeks modestly improves intense pain, sharp pain, and cold and itchy sensations when compared with a placebo emu oil (102329). It is possible that any benefit of this product is due to camphor. Camphor is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for topical use as an analgesic and anesthetic (272).\nless\nPostoperative pain. Small clinical studies suggest that oral or topical cannabidiol may not significantly affect postoperative pain.\nClinical research in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair shows that taking a buccally-absorbed cannabidiol (Oravexx; Orcosa) in a weight-based dose for 14 days postoperatively modestly reduces pain the day after surgery, but not on postoperative days 2, 7, or 14, when compared with placebo. Opioid intake was low and not significantly different between groups. Patients who weighed less than 80 kg received cannabidiol 25 mg three times daily; others received cannabidiol 50 mg three times daily (109174).\n\nTopical cannabidiol has also been investigated. A clinical study in adults undergoing unilateral total knee arthroplasty shows that applying a topical formulation containing cannabidiol 120 mg per ounce three times daily around the knee, beginning on the day of surgery and continued for 2 weeks, does not improve pain, opioid consumption, or sleep scores when compared to patients applying a topical formulation containing arnica and wintergreen (108559). Additionally, an analysis of 6-week postoperative survey data among patients having undergone total hip or knee arthroplasty shows that self-directed cannabidiol use has no effect on pain satisfaction in the perioperative period when compared with patients who did not use cannabidiol (106636).\nless\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial in patients with PTSD.\nA small study in patients with PTSD shows that taking high purity cannabidiol 300 mg attenuates cognitive impairment, but not anxiety, alertness, or discomfort, associated with recall of traumatic events when compared with placebo. Effects on cognitive impairment were sustained for at least 1 week after treatment (107334). It should be noted that patients receiving cannabidiol had more psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., depressive and/or anxiety disorders) at baseline.\nless\nPsoriatic arthritis. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for improving pain in patients with psoriatic arthritis.\nA clinical study in adults with joint disease, including psoriatic arthritis, and moderate pain intensity shows that adjunctive therapy with synthetic cannabidiol 20-30 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve pain intensity in the previous 24 hours when compared with placebo (106635).\nless\nPsychological well-being. It is unclear if an oral cannabidiol-rich hemp oil extract improves psychological well-being in healthy patients.\nAn open-label clinical study in frontline hospital workers in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic shows that taking cannabidiol (PurMed Global) 150 mg, provided in 1 mL of medium-chain triglyceride oil, twice daily for 28 days in conjunction with standard care modestly reduces emotional exhaustion within 14 days of treatment, as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety within 7 days of treatment, when compared with standard care alone. Standard care included motivational and instructional videos and weekly meetings with a behavioral health provider (105696). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of blinding and placebo control. Also, a small clinical study in healthy overweight adults shows that taking a specific hemp oil extract (PlusCBD Extra Strength Hemp Extract) as 60 mg, providing 15 mg cannabidiol, daily for 6 weeks seems to improve ability to cope with stress and general enjoyment of life when compared with placebo (103805). The validity of this study is limited by its exploratory nature.\nless\nPsychosis. It is unclear if inhaling cannabidiol is beneficial in patients with acute psychosis.\nA small open-label study in patients hospitalized with acute psychosis who have either schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, as well as concomitant tobacco use disorder, shows that smoking cigarettes containing cannabidiol 20 mg and tobacco for 4 weeks as add-on therapy has no effect on positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scores, subjective well-being, depressive symptoms, violence prediction assessment, or antipsychotic drug use when compared with smoking cigarettes containing tobacco only (107332).\nless\nRapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for the management of Parkinson disease-related RBD.\nOne small clinical study in patients with RBD due to Parkinson disease shows that taking cannabidiol 75 mg nightly for one week, 150 mg nightly for the second week, and 300 mg nightly for the next 10 weeks does not reduce RBD behaviors or improve sleep when compared with placebo (105494).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear whether an oromucosal cannabis spray containing cannabidiol and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) improves RA symptoms.\nA small clinical study in adults with RA shows that using a specific oromucosal cannabis spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals), containing cannabidiol 2.5 mg and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.7 mg per actuation, daily for 5 weeks may help decrease morning pain and improve quality of sleep, but not joint stiffness or total pain intensity, when compared with placebo (61762). The effects of cannabidiol alone are unclear.\nless\nSchizophrenia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral cannabidiol may modestly reduce symptoms and improve wellbeing in patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform psychosis.\nA small clinical trial in patients with acute paranoid schizophrenia or schizophreniform psychosis shows that taking cannabidiol 400 mg four times daily for 4 weeks modestly improves psychotic symptoms and cognition when compared to baseline and seems to be no better than taking the antipsychotic amisulpride 600-800 mg daily (89680, 105497). Another small clinical trial in patients with schizophrenia shows that adding cannabidiol 1000 mg daily (as 10 mL of a 100 mg/mL solution) for 6 weeks to standard treatment modestly improves positive symptoms and wellbeing when compared with adding placebo to standard treatment (104014).\nless\nSmoking cessation. It is unclear if cannabidiol reduces cravings for cigarettes or limits nicotine withdrawal symptoms.\nA small clinical study in cigarette smokers wishing to quit suggests that inhaling one spray of cannabidiol 400 mcg when craving a cigarette reduces the number of cigarettes smoked during one week by 40% when compared to baseline (89684). The interpretation of this finding is limited by the short study duration and a lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group. A small crossover study in e-cigarette users with nicotine withdrawal shows that taking cannabidiol 320 mg once before an abstinence session reduces self-reported nicotine withdrawal severity and anxiety at 4 hours after administration when compared with not taking cannabidiol before the session (113036). The interpretation of these findings is also limited by the short study duration, as well as lack of blinding.\nless\nSocial anxiety disorder. It is unclear if oral cannabidiol is beneficial for reducing overall anxiety or anxiety during public speaking; the available research is conflicting.\nA small clinical study in Japanese adolescents with social anxiety disorder shows that taking cannabidiol 300 mg daily for 4 weeks improves anxiety when compared with placebo (102326). However, other preliminary clinical research in patients with social anxiety disorder or panic disorder shows that taking cannabidiol (STI pharmaceuticals, UK or THC Pharm) 300 mg about 2 hours prior to each of eight separate cognitive behavioral therapy sessions does not improve symptoms when compared with placebo (109184).\n\nResearch on the use of cannabidiol for anxiety associated with public speaking has yielded conflicting results. Small clinical studies demonstrate that taking cannabidiol 300-600 mg as a single dose tends to reduce overall anxiety, but this reduction was noted only before or after, and not during, the speech in some subjects (89675, 89909, 99602). These differences may be due to small study size, baseline anxiety severity, and the use of non-standardized products. Also, cannabidiol does not seem to reduce speaking anxiety in patients at higher risk for psychiatric complications. One small clinical study in adults at high risk for psychosis shows that taking cannabidiol 600 mg daily for 8 days does not reduce anxiety during a simulated public speaking test when compared with placebo (102325).\nless\nTemporomandibular disorders (TMD). A small clinical study suggests that topical cannabidiol may reduce TMD pain.\nA small clinical study in adults with TMD shows that applying a 20% cannabidiol ointment topically over the masseter muscles twice daily for 14 days improves nerve activity as measured by surface electromyography when compared with placebo. The ointment also seems to reduce pain in the masseter muscle when compared with baseline. However, the validity of this finding is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the placebo ointment (102327).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate cannabidiol for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nCannabidiol has most often been used in daily doses of 200 mg or less for up to 13 weeks. It has also been used in single doses of 300-600 mg. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nTaking cannabidiol with food or beverage, such as whole milk, increases its absorption. Alcohol can also increase the absorption of cannabidiol. Additionally, taking oil-based cannabidiol products with fatty foods significantly increases cannabidiol absorption and reduces the time to maximum plasma concentrations (99613, 100878, 103032).\nTopical:\nCannabidiol has been used in various topical formulations including oils, lotions, and gels, often in combination with other ingredients. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nThere is limited research available for non-prescription cannabidiol products. Use prescription cannabidiol as labeled.\nStandardization & Formulation\nFormulations of cannabidiol used in clinical trials have included oral capsules (61989, 89689, 109177), sublingual spray (61720, 61762), and oil-based solution (97017, 97019, 97020, 97022, 97025, 109185, 109187). An FDA-approved, oil-based solution (Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is formulated with sesame oil and standardized to contain 100 mg/mL pure cannabidiol extract (97017, 97022).\n\nOff-the-shelf evaluations of commercially available oral cannabidiol products have demonstrated consistent issues with product standardization and labeling. One laboratory assessment of the cannabidiol content of 84 products commercially available in the US identified only 26 products that were labeled accurately (95504). Another assessment found that 54% of 121 products available in the US were labelled accurately. Similar issues were found with topical products (109172). The cannabidiol content of the remaining products was either over- or under-labeled. Also, about 21% of products in one analysis contained unlabeled delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (95504). Other assessments of 14 products commercially available in Europe and 25 products available in the US found that up to 90% of the products were not labeled accurately and that up to 86% of products contained detectable quantities of THC (97978, 104015). Another laboratory assessment of 39 commercially available products identified only 6 products that were accurately labeled. Eleven products were oil-based, of which only 36% were accurately labeled and over 50% were found to contain THC. Twenty-one products were aqueous based, of which only 7% were accurately labeled (108563).\n\nThe Cannabis sativa plant is classified as a phytoremediator, meaning that it readily absorbs contaminants from the soil. Due to this, cannabidiol products are at high risk for contamination with these compounds, including heavy metals and pesticides. Alarming concentrations of pesticides have been found in cannabinoid-containing products sold in the Netherlands, California, and Canada (102337). Also, heavy metals, most commonly lead, have been detected in up to 42% of edible cannabidiol products sampled from the US; four products exceeded the California Proposition 65 threshold for daily lead consumption in two servings (109172).\n\nCannabidiol is also available in an e-liquid formulation to be used in e-cigarettes for administration by vaping. Off-the-shelf evaluation of seven commercially available e-liquids found that two of the products were contaminated with an undeclared synthetic cannabimimetic (5F-ADB), two contained undeclared THC, and one contained undeclared dextromethorphan (99601). Cannabidiol sold commercially may be contaminated with synthetic cannabinoids that can increase the risk of serious adverse effects. This seems to be especially prevalent with cannabidiol products intended for vaping (103040, 104015).\n\nNabiximols (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) (Sativex, Otsuka Pharmaceutical) is an oromucosal spray containing whole-plant extract of cannabis. The extract is standardized to contain cannabidiol 2.5 mg and THC 2.7 mg and per actuation. Other constituents in the spray included ethanol, propylene glycol, peppermint oil flavoring, terpenoids, flavonoids, and minor amounts of other cannabinoids such as cannabinol, cannabichromene, and cannabigerol (61762, 91907, 96814).",
            "Interactions with Drugs": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nBRIVARACETAM (Briviact)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCannabidiol might increase brivaracetam levels.\nBrivaracetam is a substrate of CYP2C19. Clinical research shows that cannabidiol inhibits CYP2C19 (89694, 89695, 97018, 97022). Evidence from a case series shows that patients receiving cannabidiol experienced a 95% to 280% increase in brivaracetam levels (100881).\nless\nCAFFEINE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nCannabidiol can increase caffeine levels.\nCaffeine is a substrate of CYP1A2, and cannabidiol has been shown to inhibit CYP1A2 metabolism. A pharmacokinetic study in healthy adults shows that taking oral cannabidiol, starting at 250 mg once daily and titrating to 750 twice daily over a total of 24 days, increases the peak serum level of caffeine by 15% and the overall exposure to caffeine by 95% after a single dose of caffeine 200 mg taken on day 23 (105557). Other clinical research also shows that cannabidiol modestly increases the area under the curve of caffeine but does not increase peak serum levels of caffeine (113025).\nless\nCARBAMAZEPINE (Tegretol)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nCannabidiol might increase carbamazepine levels.\nResearch in murine animal models shows that giving a single oral dose of cannabidiol 50 mg/kg with carbamazepine 80 mg/kg increases carbamazepine's area under the curve (AUC) by 53% when compared with control. A higher single dose of cannabidiol 120 mg/kg has a similar effect on carbamazepine levels. Multiple doses of cannabidiol have a slightly larger effect. Giving cannabidiol daily for 14 days increases the AUC of carbamazepine by 66% (103033).\nless\nCITALOPRAM (Celexa)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nCannabidiol can increase citalopram levels.\nA small open-label study in young adults stabilized on citalopram or escitalopram shows that taking adjunctive cannabidiol 200-800 mg daily for 12 weeks increases plasma concentrations of citalopram from an average of 42 ng/mL at baseline to an average of 79 ng/mL at 8 weeks and 63 ng/mL at 12 weeks. Patients reported fatigue and gastrointestinal disturbances; there were no reports suggestive of serotonergic toxicity. In vitro evidence suggests that this interaction may be due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and 3A4 by cannabidiol (105491). This finding is limited due to small study size and large interindividual variability.\nless\nCLOBAZAM (Onfi)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nCannabidiol might increase levels of clobazam and increase the occurrence of somnolence.\nIn clinical studies, concomitant administration of cannabidiol and clobazam is associated with up to a 60% increase in serum levels of N-desmethylclobazam, the primary active metabolite of clobazam. This increased concentration is likely due to inhibition of CYP2C19 by cannabidiol. However, the interaction does not appear to be dose-dependent. In children and adults, concomitant use of cannabidiol and clobazam is associated with an increased occurrence of somnolence (97018, 97022, 97023, 97979, 97980, 106631).\nless\nCNS DEPRESSANTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, cannabidiol might have additive effects if used with other CNS depressants.\nPreliminary clinical research, case reports, and animal studies suggest that high dose cannabidiol has sedative and hypnotic effects (61989, 89986, 89987, 110248). Theoretically, concomitant use of cannabidiol with drugs with sedative and anesthetic properties may cause additive therapeutic and adverse effects.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, cannabidiol might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A1.\nIn vitro research shows that cannabidiol inhibits CYP1A1 (89690). However, this interaction has yet to be reported in humans. Until more is known, use with caution. Theoretically, concomitant use of cannabidiol with CYP1A1 substrates might decrease the clearance of these substrates and increase the risk for adverse effects.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nCannabidiol may increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2.\nIn vitro research shows that cannabidiol inhibits CYP1A2 (89690, 107325). Furthermore, clinical studies show that cannabidiol may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine, a CYP1A2 substrate. Two pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults show that taking cannabidiol dosed 640 mg once up to 750 twice daily increases the area under the curve of caffeine. However, results are mixed over whether cannabidiol impacts peak serum levels of caffeine (105557, 113025).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, cannabidiol might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1B1.\nIn vitro research shows that cannabidiol inhibits CYP1B1 (89690).

In clinical studies and case reports, cannabidiol use resulted in significant increases in the serum levels of topiramate, methadone, citalopram, omeprazole, and N-desmethylclobazam, the primary active metabolite of clobazam. These chemicals are metabolized by CYP2C19 (97018, 97022, 97023, 102958, 105491, 113025).

In human studies, cannabidiol has been associated with an increase in plasma levels of topiramate and losartan, CYP2C9 substrates (97018, 113025). Concomitant use of cannabidiol with CYP2C9 substrates may increase the risk for adverse effects from these substrates.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, cannabidiol might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6.\nIn vitro research shows that cannabidiol inhibits CYP2D6 (89692, 107325).

In human studies and case reports, cannabidiol has been associated with an increase in plasma levels of the CYP3A4 substrates zonisamide, tacrolimus, everolimus, citalopram, midazolam, and methadone (97018, 100884, 100892, 102958, 105491, 113025).\nless\nESLICARBAZEPINE (Aptiom)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCannabidiol might increase eslicarbazepine levels.\nIn clinical research, concomitant administration of cannabidiol and eslicarbazepine is associated with a modest increase in plasma levels of eslicarbazepine. The mechanism for this interaction is unknown; eslicarbazepine is metabolized via glucuronidation. Eslicarbazepine levels stayed within the normal range and did not require dose adjustment. However, caution should be exercised when cannabidiol and eslicarbazepine are taken together (97018).\nless\nEVEROLIMUS (Zortress)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCannabidiol may increase everolimus levels.\nEverolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4 enzymes. Cannabidiol has been shown to inhibit CYP3A4 (89693, 89694, 89695, 97018). A very small open-label clinical study shows that cannabidiol 12.5 mg/kg twice daily increases the area under the curve of a single dose of everolimus by about 2.5-fold (113053). A retrospective study in children taking everolimus for tuberous sclerosis has found that adding treatment with cannabidiol increases everolimus serum concentration by a median of 9.8 ng/mL (103035). In a case report, a 6-year-old girl stable on everolimus with refractory tonic seizures was started on cannabidiol titrated up to 200 mg daily for 6 weeks. This led to elevated levels of everolimus (100892).\nless\nFLUOXETINE (Prozac)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nCannabidiol might increase fluoxetine levels in certain patients.\nIn one case report, a 17-year-old male with autism previously stabilized on fluoxetine 20 mg daily developed insomnia, agitation, hyperactivity, yelling, and worsening symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder after taking cannabidiol 18 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. The patient was found to be a poor cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolizer (CYP2D6*4/*4). Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent, by CYP2C9. Although fluoxetine levels weren't measured, it was hypothesized that the lack of CYP2D6 activity resulted in fluoxetine being metabolized solely by CYP2C9, which was subsequently inhibited by cannabidiol. This would have increased levels of fluoxetine, resulting in adverse effects (109186).

Theoretically, lithium toxicity might have occurred due to cannabidiol-induced renal dysfunction (104018).\nless\nLOSARTAN (Cozaar)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nCannabidiol may increase levels of losartan.\nA crossover clinical study shows that taking cannabidiol 640 mg once increases area under the curve of losartan, a CYP2C9 substrate, by 77% (113025).\nless\nMETHADONE (Dolophine)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nCannabidiol might increase levels of methadone, but the evidence is limited to a single case report.\nIn a case report, a 13-year-old female with chronic cancer pain who was previously stabilized on methadone 7.5 mg twice daily presented to the emergency room with opioid-related side effects. She had begun experiencing increased sleepiness and fatigue after being given cannabidiol oil 1.5 grams orally in six divided doses daily by her parents. Her serum levels of methadone had risen to 271 ng/mL but decreased to 124 ng/mL after discontinuation of cannabidiol. This coincided with resolution of excessive sleepiness and fatigue (102958). Theoretically, cannabidiol increases levels of methadone by inhibiting cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP2C19 enzymes, which metabolize methadone (99613, 102958).\nless\nMIDAZOLAM (Versed)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nCannabidiol may increase levels of midazolam.\nA crossover clinical study shows that taking cannabidiol 640 mg once increases area under the curve of midazolam by 56%, likely by inhibiting CYP3A (113025).\nless\nOMEPRAZOLE (Prilosec)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nCannabidiol may increase levels of omeprazole.\nA crossover clinical study shows that taking cannabidiol 640 mg once increases area under the curve of omeprazole by 207%, likely by inhibiting CYP2C19 (113025).\nless\nRUFINAMIDE (Banzel)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCannabidiol might increase rufinamide levels.\nIn clinical research, concomitant administration of cannabidiol and rufinamide is associated with a modest increase in plasma levels of rufinamide.

Cannabidiol has been shown to inhibit CYP3A4 enzymes (89693, 89694, 89695, 97018). A retrospective study in children taking sirolimus for tuberous sclerosis has found that adding treatment with cannabidiol increases serum sirolimus concentration by a median of 5.1 ng/mL (103035).\nless\nSTIRIPENTOL (Diacomit)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nCannabidiol can increase stiripentol levels.\nTwo clinical pharmacokinetic studies in patients stabilized on stiripentol shows that adding cannabidiol, 750 mg twice daily for 3-10 days or up to 20 mg/kg daily for 24 days, increases the average maximum concentration of stiripentol by 17% to 28% and the average area under the curve by 30% to 55% when compared with taking stiripentol alone. The mechanism for this interaction is unknown; cannabidiol might inhibit cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) and/or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms, which metabolize stiripentol (103030, 103039). Although there were no adverse clinical outcomes, caution should be exercised when cannabidiol and stiripentol are taken together.\nless\nTACROLIMUS (Prograf)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCannabidiol might increase tacrolimus levels.\nTacrolimus is a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate. Cannabidiol has been shown to inhibit CYP3A4 enzymes (89693, 89694, 89695, 97018). In a case report, a patient stabilized on tacrolimus experienced about a 3-fold increase in tacrolimus concentrations after starting to take cannabidiol 2000-2900 mg daily for epilepsy (100884).\nless\nTAMOXIFEN (Nolvadex)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nChronic use of cannabidiol 40 mg daily might modestly reduce levels of tamoxifen's active metabolites.\nIn one case report, a 50-year-old female who was taking tamoxifen 20 mg daily for the past 5 years and cannabidiol 40 mg daily for about four months, presented with a 9.2% increase in N-desmethyltamoxifen and an 18.8% increase in endoxifen levels after discontinuing cannabidiol for 67 days. Theoretically, cannabidiol may have modestly inhibited cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP2D6, which metabolize tamoxifen into N-desmethyltamoxifen and endoxifen, respectively. Cannabidiol discontinuation may have resulted in a return to normal enzyme activity (104886).\nless\nTOPIRAMATE (Topamax)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCannabidiol might increase topiramate levels.\nIn clinical research, concomitant administration of cannabidiol and topiramate, a CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrate, is associated with a modest increase in plasma levels of topiramate. Topiramate levels stayed within the normal range and did not require dose adjustment. However, caution should be exercised when cannabidiol and topiramate are taken together (97018).\nless\nVALPROATE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT))\nCannabidiol might increase the risk of hepatotoxicity and thrombocytopenia with valproic acid.\nIn clinical research, concomitant administration of valproic acid and cannabidiol is associated with elevated liver transaminases and rare cases of thrombocytopenia. Liver transaminase levels and platelet counts should be closely monitored when cannabidiol and valproic acid are taken together. Liver transaminase elevation appears to be mild in the majority of cases; however, severe elevations can occur. At least 15 cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported following concomitant administration of valproic acid and cannabidiol. While thrombocytopenia is a known adverse effect with valproic acid, the risk may be modestly higher when cannabidiol and valproic acid are administered concomitantly (97017, 97018, 97019, 97022, 97979, 97980, 102323, 103030, 103039, 103041). It is unclear if and how cannabidiol contributes to the risk of these adverse events, as there does not appear to be a direct pharmacokinetic interaction. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans show that coadministration of valproate with cannabidiol does not have clinically meaningful effects on levels of valproate or its metabolite 4-ene-VPA (103030, 103039).\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nCannabidiol might increase warfarin levels.\nThere are at least two case reports of patients who were previously stable on warfarin presenting with a supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) after starting cannabidiol (Epidiolex) titrated up to a dose of 20 mg/kg daily. Warfarin dose reductions of 20% to 30% were required to normalize the INR. Cannabidiol may have inhibited cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), resulting in decreased warfarin metabolism and increased levels (104013).\nless\nZONISAMIDE (Zonegran)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCannabidiol might increase zonisamide levels.\nIn clinical research, concomitant administration of cannabidiol and zonisamide, a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate, is associated with a modest increase in plasma levels of zonisamide.

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with cannabidiol.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAnimal research suggests that oral cannabidiol is poorly absorbed, with a bioavailability between 13% to 19%. This is likely due to a significant first-pass effect (89905, 106629). After oral administration of a specific, oil-based solution (Epidiolex) and other cannabidiol-rich cannabis extracts in humans, maximum plasma concentrations occur after 2-5 hours (99613, 103043, 104883, 106629, 108558). Taking oral cannabidiol 10 mg/kg daily long-term results in mean plasma concentrations of 5.9-11.2 ng/mL (61781). Plasma levels of cannabidiol are dose-dependent (110242).\n\nVarious formulations of oral cannabidiol have been developed, often with the intention of improving absorption. In a study comparing a 100-mg dose of various oral formulations (i.e., oil-based solution, capsule, and pharmaceutical-grade syrup), the highest maximum plasma concentration (21 ng/ml) occurred with Epidiolex (108558). Water-soluble cannabidiol powder in emulsified, homogenized medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil appears to have faster absorption over 90 minutes than lipid-soluble cannabidiol powder in non-emulsified, non-homogenized MCT oil (103036). Additionally, powdered cannabidiol formulated in a self-emulsifying drug delivery system seems to result in faster and greater absorption and an overall greater exposure to cannabidiol when compared with powdered cannabidiol in sesame oil or in MCT oil (100882, 104016). Similar findings occur with the use of a cannabis product in a nanoemulsion delivery system (Solutech) (109181). Furthermore, cannabidiol 90 mg given in a TurboCBD capsule results in higher exposure and higher serum levels at 90 minutes and 120 minutes when compared with regular cannabidiol. However, there were no differences in bioavailability when both formulations were given in 45-mg doses (100886).\n\nVarious inhaled formulations of cannabidiol have also been evaluated. After inhalation of a specific breath-activated dry powder inhaler (DreamBoat, MannKind Corporation) formulation of cannabidiol, peak plasma concentrations occur in 4 minutes and the dose-adjusted peak plasma concentration of a single dose is increased 71-fold when compared with single-dose oral administration of Epidiolex in healthy adults (106629). One study comparing a 100-mg dose of vaporized cannabidiol found that cannabidiol-dominant cannabis (containing THC 3.7 mg) produces a higher plasma cannabidiol concentration (171 ng/mL) and longer time to last detection (17 hours) than pure cannabidiol (108558).\n\nAdministration of oral cannabidiol with food affects absorption (106629). Taking oil-based cannabidiol with a high-fat and high-calorie meal can increase the maximum concentration of cannabidiol by 5-fold when compared to taking cannabidiol in a fasting state. A low-fat and low-calorie meal increases cannabidiol maximum concentration by about 4-fold, whole milk increases its maximum concentration by 3-fold, and alcohol increases its maximum concentration by about 2-fold (103032, 103043). A small analysis in healthy adults shows that maximum concentrations of cannabidiol are higher in a fed state when compared with an overnight fasted state (108558).\n\nIn humans, the bioavailability of inhaled cannabidiol ranges from 11% to 45% (61924). However, inhaled cannabidiol bioavailability of greater than 65% has been reported when using a specific cannabidiol metered dose inhaler (STI Pharmaceuticals) (89684). The dose-adjusted bioavailability of a single dose of inhaled cannabidiol using a specific breath-activated dry powder inhaler (DreamBoat, MannKind Corporation) is increased 9-fold when compared with single-dose oral administration of Epidiolex in healthy adults (106629). Plasma levels of cannabidiol are dose-dependent (110256).\n\nThe transdermal bioavailability of cannabidiol in humans is unknown.\nDistribution\nA specific oil-based solution of cannabidiol (Epidiolex) exhibits a large volume of distribution after oral administration. Cannabidiol and its metabolites are more than 94% protein bound (99613).\nMetabolism\nSimilar to other cannabinoids, cannabidiol is hepatically metabolized and undergoes hydroxylation, oxidation, beta-oxidation, conjugation, and epoxidation (61821, 103043, 106629). Cannabidiol is metabolized to 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol, which is further converted to the primary circulating metabolite, 7-carboxy-cannabidiol. This inactive metabolite occurs at a blood concentration about 40-fold greater than the parent compound. Inhalation of a single dose of a dry powder inhaler formulation of cannabidiol yields a 25-fold reduction in the inactive metabolite-to-parent compound ratio compared with single-dose oral administration of a specific, oil-based cannabidiol solution (Epidiolex) in healthy adults (106629). Conjugation of the parent compound and its hydroxylated metabolites with fatty acids increases their lipophilicity and ability to accumulate in tissues (89907). Additionally evidence in healthy adults shows that females have increased exposure of 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol and 7-carboxy-cannabidiol metabolites in relation to parent cannabidiol, which may represent pharmacokinetic differences among males and females (113046).\nExcretion\nAfter oral administration of a specific, oil-based solution of cannabidiol (Epidiolex), the terminal half-life of cannabidiol is about 58 hours (99613). After oral administration of a sublingual wafer containing cannabidiol (WaferiX, iXSyrinx Pty Ltd) 50 mg twice daily for 5 days, the terminal half-life of cannabidiol was 68.4 hours (104883). Clinical research suggests that the half-lives of inhaled and intravenous cannabidiol are 31 hours and 24 hours, respectively (61924). Cannabidiol is primarily excreted in the feces, with minimal renal elimination (99613). Oral administration of cannabidiol-rich cannabis extracts in children had an average acute half-life of 6.2 hours, ranging from about 3 to 9 hours (103043).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nUnlike delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) does not activate the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptors (89683). This is thought to explain its lack of psychotropic effects. However, when exposed to temperatures typically occurring in e-cigarettes, cannabidiol can be converted to both THC and delta-8-THC, as well as other cannabinoids (106103). Also, CBD has been shown to interact or interfere with a number of endocannabinoid and non-endocannabinoid signaling systems. At low concentrations, CBD has been shown to block the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55, transient receptor potential of melastatin type 8 (TRPM8) channel, and equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT), as well as enhance the activity of the 5-HT1A receptor, alpha3 and alpha1 glycine receptors, and transient receptor potential of ankyrin type 1 (TRPA1) channel. At higher concentrations CBD has been shown to enhance the activity of the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and the transient receptor potential of vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and 2 (TRPV2) channels (89925). CBD also inhibits the cellular uptake and degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide (89680).\n\nSome evidence suggests that CBD enhances the beneficial effects of THC by limiting its psychotropic activity and thus increasing its tolerability at higher doses (89926). This might be explained by research showing that CBD counteracts CB1 activation in the brain (89927). This is further supported by the fact that more psychotic symptoms are reported in cannabis users who smoke preparations with low CBD:THC ratios as opposed to preparations with high CBD:THC ratios (89928). However, not all evidence agrees. In a small clinical study in healthy patients, vaporizing cannabis containing equivalent (11%) concentrations of CBD and THC appears no less impairing than cannabis containing only THC (11%). In fact, vaping THC with CBD might exacerbate THC-induced impairment as measured by lane weaving during a car-following task (100877).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCBD has been shown to modulate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, and interferon (IFN)-gamma and suppress chemokine production (61782, 62004, 89997). In a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, CBD improved arthritis symptoms and blocked disease progression (90000). However, clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking CBD daily for 13 weeks does not alter plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-alpha, or IL-6 (97021). Other clinical research in adults with Crohn disease shows that taking CBD daily for 8 weeks does not alter plasma CRP levels or reduce disease activity (97026). Another study in healthy subjects shows that taking a single dose of cannabidiol 30 mg does not affect levels of IL-10 or TNF in non-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at 90 minutes when compared to baseline. However TNF levels were reduced in LPS-stimulated PBMCs at 90 minutes after CBD administration compared to baseline, which suggests a potential anti-inflammatory effect (103036). Clinical research in male athletes undergoing an endurance-type exercise suggests that taking a single dose of cannabidiol 300 mg (GD Cann®-C; GD Pharma Pty Ltd) 90 minutes before exercise might modestly improve levels of serum IL-1-beta, but has no effect on IL-6 or TNF-alpha, when compared with placebo (108557). However, in female athletes, taking cannabidiol 5 mg/kg a total of three times before and after an exercise session does not affect levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, or IL-10 (109180).\nAntidepressant effects\nAnimal models of depression show that CBD has some antidepressant effects (89977, 89978, 89979, 89980). These effects may be explained by CBD's facilitation of endocannabinoid activity, facilitation of 5HT1A receptor activity, and/or facilitation of hippocampal neurogenesis (89964).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSome animal research shows that CBD reduces insulitis in non-obese, diabetes-prone mice, inhibiting the initiation or progression of diabetes (61783). Conversely, in a mouse model of diabetes, CBD failed to prevent hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and pancreatic beta cell loss, and actually worsened glomerular lesions (107328). Other in vitro and in vivo research suggest that CBD might reduce the risk for cardiac and retinal complications of diabetes via anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects (89948, 89949, 89951). However, clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking CBD daily for 13 weeks does not alter plasma insulin levels, fasting plasma glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin, insulin resistance, or insulin sensitivity. In addition, it does not alter the gastrointestinal levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) (97021).\nAntiepileptic effects\nAnimal models of epilepsy, as well as clinical research, show that CBD has antiepileptic effects (62018, 89981, 89982, 89983, 89984, 89985). A number of human trials have demonstrated antiepileptic activity in a variety of treatment-resistant epilepsy syndromes, including Dravet, Lennox-Gastaut, Sturge-Weber, and tuberous sclerosis complex (97017, 97019, 97022, 97025, 97979, 97980, 106631). However, the mechanism of action is unclear. Overall, the therapeutic effects of CBD might be explained by a combination of factors: CBD increases levels of the antiepileptic drug clobazam, affects gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors, and potentially affects complementary anticonvulsant pathways (100875). These anticonvulsant pathways include blocking ENT and GPR55 and enhancing the activity of the TRPV1 channel, 5-HT1A receptor, and alpha3 and alpha1 glycine receptors (89925). Further, pharmacogenetic variation has been shown to be associated with CBD response in treatment-resistant epilepsy and can influence the expression of potential CBD targets (107324).\nAntineoplastic effects\nThe anti-tumor effects of CBD have been studied in vitro and in vivo in breast cancer, colon cancer, glioma, leukemia, lung cancer, lymphoma, and thyroid cancer (89929). In vitro and in vivo research show that CBD inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cells, interferes with invasion and metastases of breast cancer cells, and decreases tumor mass (89930, 89931, 89932). Additionally, concentration-dependent breast cancer cell death has been shown with CBD in vitro. The purported mechanisms of breast cancer cell autophagy and apoptosis due to CBD include induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress; inhibition of Akt, mTOR, and 4EBP1 signaling; production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, which ultimately leads to activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (89933). An animal model of colon cancer shows that CBD reduces polyps and tumor formation in vivo (89946). In vitro research shows that CBD inhibits proliferation, invasiveness, and migration of glioma cells, and in vivo research shows that CBD reduces glioma tumor growth (61733, 61789, 89934, 89937, 89938, 89939). CBD's effect on glioma cells is thought to be related to a number of mechanisms, including reduction of ERK, Akt, 5-LOX, and HIF-1alpha signaling; capsase-3 activation; ROS production; and increased FAAH signaling (89929). Some in vitro and in vivo evidence shows that CBD induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, possibly via ROS production and CB2 receptor activity (61735, 61784). In vitro and in vivo research shows that CBD impairs the invasion of human lung carcinoma cells, ultimately decreasing lung metastases in vivo (89942, 89943, 89944). CBD has also been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells in vitro (89945).\nAntinociceptive effects\nSome research shows that CBD reduces tactile allodynia and thermal hypersensitivity in an animal model of neuropathic pain (89947). In a mouse model of persistent pain characterized by an initial acute phase and a subsequent inflammatory phase, CBD improved pain limited to the acute phase in male mice only. Conversely, female mice treated with CBD demonstrated increased pain behaviors during the acute phase. CBD combined with low-dose morphine did not provide a synergistic antinociceptive response (107337). Also, in other animal research, CBD did not demonstrate analgesic effects when used alone or in an opioid formulation (107338). Similarly, research in humans suggests that a single dose of cannabidiol does not reduce acute experimentally induced pain (105500, 105595, 108560). Also, a study in healthy adults shows that taking a single dose of oral cannabidiol oil 1600 mg does not improve opioid-induced hyperalgesia when compared with placebo (108560).\nAntioxidant effects\nLaboratory research suggests that cannabidiol (CBD) has antioxidant effects. Laboratory optical and electrochemical methods suggest that CBD has similar antioxidant activity to ascorbic acid, resveratrol, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (103019). However, these tests should be confirmed with in vivo models prior to concluding that CBD has antioxidant effects in animals or humans. Additional in vitro research shows that CBD protects rat cortical neuron cultures from oxidative damage from toxic levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate (103020).\nAntipsychotic effects\nThe exact mechanism of CBDs antipsychotic effects is unclear (89964). The antipsychotic effects of CBD have been evaluated in several animal models of psychosis. In mice, CBD reduced dexamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (89968). Further, CBD has been shown to be superior to haloperidol and comparable to clozapine in reducing ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion in mice (89969). In another animal model, CBD and clozapine were both shown to induce c-fos expression in the nucleus accumbens region of the brain, suggesting that CBD may have a similar mechanism of action to the atypical antipsychotics (89970). Intracerebroventricular administration of CBD has been shown to increase extracellular dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, which differs from the dopamine-2 receptor antagonism seen with antipsychotic drugs (89976). One small clinical study in healthy adults shows that a single dose of CBD increases blood flow in the hippocampus, which could theoretically impact the presentation of schizophrenia (104012). In another clinical study, improvement in psychotic symptoms with CBD was associated with higher anandamide levels (89680). It has been theorized that anandamide counteracts dopamine-2 receptor activity. Thus, increases in anandamide due to CBD administration might counteract the overactivation of dopamine-2 receptors in psychotic disorders (89965). Conversely, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with cannabis use disorder shows that taking CBD 400 mg and 800 mg daily for 28 days does not increase anandamide levels compared to baseline, but 800 mg may limit decreases in anandamide levels when compared with placebo. No changes in anandamide levels correlated to changes in clinical symptoms (113038). In vitro and animal research also suggests that CBD is active in both dopamine-based and glutamine-based models of schizophrenia (89925). Other potential mechanisms of CBD's antipsychotic effects include activation of TRPV1 channels, facilitation of 5-HT1A-mediated neurotransmission, and attenuation of immune responses related to psychotic disorders (89964, 89975).\n\nThere is also interest in using CBD to counteract the psychiatric effects of THC. In rats, CBD has been shown to reverse THC-induced reduction of social interaction and apomorphine-induced sniffing, biting, and other behaviors (89966, 89967). Several small studies in humans show that pretreatment and/or simultaneous treatment with CBD reduces euphoria and anxiety caused by THC administration (61860, 61969, 89973). However, one study shows that a single dose of CBD does not seem to attenuate THC effects (104497). Neuroimaging studies show that CBD has opposite effects compared to THC in brain regions known to be associated with THC-induced psychotic effects.\n\nThese include the ventral and dorsal striatum, anterior cingulate gyrus, and right temporal lobe, suggesting that CBD's antipsychotic mechanism may involve these brain regions (89964).\nAntiviral effects\nOne in vitro and animal study shows that high purity CBD inhibits SARS-CoV-2 viral replication following viral entry into host cells (107333). However, a small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate infection with SARS-CoV-2 found no benefit with the use of CBD 300 mg daily for 14 days when compared with placebo (107331).\nAnxiolytic effects\nAnimal studies show that CBD has anxiolytic activity in animal models of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (89955, 89956, 89957, 89958, 89959, 89960, 89961). According to some animal research, the anxiolytic effects of CBD may follow an inverse U-shaped curve, with very high doses (over 20 mg/kg in rats) being ineffective (89955). Imaging studies of the brain show that CBD influences brain activity in areas related to emotional processes (61732, 89963). In vivo research suggests that the following mechanisms may explain CBD's anxiolytic effects: activation of 5HT1A receptors, facilitation of endocannabinoid system, enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis, and/or activation of TRP channels (89964). There is some concern that some of the reported anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol might be due to a placebo effect. One small study in healthy volunteers found that consuming cannabidiol-free hemp oil while being told that it contains cannabidiol seems to reduce anticipatory stress, but does not reduce other measures of stress and anxiety, when compared with consuming open-label cannabidiol-free hemp oil (105556).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn rat models of primary and secondary hypertension, chronic administration of CBD reduces hypertrophy and improves acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation response in both large and small vessels (107329). Additionally, a crossover clinical study in patients with mild to moderate hypertension shows that taking CBD titrated to 375-450 mg daily reduces serum urotensin-II levels when compared to baseline; urotensin-II levels are weakly correlated to mean arterial blood pressure (113043).\nDrug metabolism effects\nIn vitro and animal research has demonstrated that CBD is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, and 3A5 (89690, 89691, 89693, 89694, 89695, 107325). In human studies, CBD has been associated with elevated serum levels of topiramate, N-desmethylclobazam, and zonisamide, substrates of CYP2C9, 2C19, and 3A4, respectively (97018), but this effect has not been observed for CYP3A5 substrates at the doses of CBD evaluated (89694). Research regarding the effects of CBD on other substrates of these CYP enzymes is lacking. When given in conjunction with a number of antiepileptic medications, no plasma level changes were seen for CBD, nor for valproate, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, ethosuximide, vigabatrin, ezogabine, pregabalin, perampanel, or lacosamide (97018).\n\nConcomitant administration of CBD with CYP3A4 inducers, CYP2C9 inducers, and CYP2C9 inhibitors appears to have no clinically significant effect on CBD concentrations (97023).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSome research suggests that CBD reduces the permeability of the gastrointestinal tract. This might be beneficial for conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, which are associated with increased gut permeability. Research in vitro shows that CBD reduces experimentally induced inflammation. Research in humans shows that CBD attenuates increased absorption of lactulose and mannitol experimentally induced by aspirin use (100879).\nHepatic effects\nCBD appears to improve neuro-inflammation and cognitive and motor impairment in a mouse model of chronic liver disease, suggesting that CBD might provide some benefit to patients with hepatic encephalopathy. This effect is possibly due to indirect activation of hippocampal A2A adenosine receptors (89954). In adults with type 2 diabetes, taking CBD daily for 13 weeks was not associated with an improvement in visceral adiposity or liver triglyceride levels (97021).\nHypnotic effects\nThe hypnotic effects of CBD have been reported in humans and animals (61989, 89986); however, the mechanism of this effect is unclear.\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn vivo and in vitro research suggest that CBD modulates immune system function, including the suppression of cell-mediated and humoral immunity and the inhibition of antigen presentation, humoral response, and proliferation, maturation, and migration of immune cells (89988). CBD has been shown to modulate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, and interferon (IFN)-gamma and suppress chemokine production (61782, 62004, 89997).\nMood effects\nClinical research in healthy, younger adults shows that taking a single dose of oral CBD 600 mg does not improve emotional processing, nor does it impact anxiety, blood pressure, or heart rate during a stress-induced test, when compared with placebo (108562).\nNeurologic effects\nIn vivo and in vitro research suggests that CBD may have neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease. While the mechanism of these effects is still unclear, it is thought to relate to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects (61736, 89989, 89990, 89991, 89992, 89994, 89995, 89996). There is also interest in the use of CBD for mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders. Some early human research suggests that CBD has beneficial effects on some measures of social cognition (110253). Preliminary clinical research suggests that taking CBD decreases gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels and affects functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results in patients with autism spectrum disorders (100887, 100888).\nReproductive effects\nSome animal research shows that dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system by chronic administration of CBD reduces sperm quality and motility, but not concentration, and increases DNA damage in sperm cells (107339).\nSedative effects\nHigh doses of CBD have been shown to have sedative activity in mice, with doses up to 4.72 mg/kg causing sedation in 50% of mice tested (89987). The mechanism of this effect is unclear."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCannabidivarin is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis. It is structurally similar to cannabidiol but with a shorter alkyl side chain. Cannabidivarin is the biosynthetic precursor of tetrahydrocannabivarin in the cannabis plant. Under acidic conditions, cannabidivarin isomerizes into tetrahydrocannabivarin. There is a greater concentration of cannabidivarin in Cannabis indica than in Cannabis sativa (101291). In vitro research shows little to no activity of cannabidivarin at human CB1 receptors, but demonstrable affinity for, and activity at, human CB2 receptors (107341).\nAntinociceptive effects\nThere is interest in using cannabidivarin for pain. Research in a rodent model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain shows that intraperitoneal cannabidivarin slightly reduces pain in female mice but not male mice (115783). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using cannabidivarin for ulcerative colitis. In vitro and animal research shows that cannabidivarin reduces neutrophil infiltration, intestinal permeability, cytokine production, and dysregulation of gut microbiota in ulcerative colitis. Cannabidivarin seems to have intestinal anti-inflammatory effects via blockade of TRPA1, which is typically up-regulated in ulcerative colitis (101296).\n\nThere is interest in using cannabidivarin for reducing symptoms of nausea. Animal research suggests that cannabidivarin has anti-nausea effects (101297).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nIn vitro research shows that cannabidivarin promotes the maturation of muscle cells taken from both healthy people and those with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, by activating TRPA1. Animal research shows that cannabidivarin improves motor activity, inflammation and autophagy which also might be beneficial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (101295).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nThere is interest in using cannabidivarin for various genetic developmental disorders, including fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Rett syndrome. Animal research in experimental mice models of early and advanced Rett syndrome shows that cannabidivarin seems to improve brain activity, movement coordination, and neurological and social deficits (101299, 101300).\n\nThere is also interest in the effects of cannabidivarin for autism spectrum disorder which has some overlap with Rett syndrome. Animal research in rat models of autism spectrum disorder shows that cannabidivarin reduces social impairments, short-term memory deficits, and repetitive behaviors and fidgeting (101301). Cannabidivarin might have these effects by desensitizing the TRPV1 receptor (101326). One small clinical study shows that a single dose of cannabidivarin increases levels of glutamate and glutamine in the left basal ganglia, but not in the frontal cortex, in both neurotypical adults and adults with autism spectrum disorder. This suggests that cannabidivarin might modulate the excitatory glutamate and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid system (104475). Another very small clinical study in adults with autism spectrum disorder shows that a single dose of cannabidivarin shifts atypical striatal functional connectivity at baseline towards neurotypical function (103744).\n\nDue to promising animal and in vitro data, there has also been interest in the anticonvulsant effects of cannabidivarin; however, research in humans has been negative so far (107343). In vitro research suggests that cannabidivarin reduces seizure activity by desensitizing the TRPV1 receptor (101326). Animal research in adult and infant rodents also shows that cannabidivarin reduces experimentally induced seizures such as maximal electroshock, audiogenic seizures, pentylenetetrazole and pilocarpine-induced seizures (101292, 101293, 101294).\n\nEx vivo research in mouse autaptic hippocampal neurons shows that cannabidivarin inhibits endocannabinoid signaling postsynaptically, potentially through interference with endogenous cannabinoid production (107342)."

In an animal model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, while low dose cannabigerol had anti-inflammatory effects, and reduced liver damage, high dose cannabigerol increased both fibrosis and inflammation (110284).\nAntilipemic effects\nIn silico research suggests that cannabigerol binds and stimulates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and PPAR-gamma, which might be beneficial for dyslipidemia (101319).\nAntinociceptive effects\nIn an animal neuropathy model, intraperitoneal cannabigerol reduces hypersensitivity. The mechanism of action of cannabigerol is at least partially related to the alpha-2 adrenergic, CB1, and CB2 receptors. However, cannabigerol does not seem to reduce pain in models of persistent, heat-related, or chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain (110279, 115783).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in the benefits of cannabinoids for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Animal and in vitro research show that cannabigerol reduces inflammation and seems to reverse experimentally-induced colitis (101313).\n\nThere is also interest in cannabigerol for stimulating appetite in disease states such as cachexia and eating disorders. Animal research shows that cannabigerol and cannabigerol-rich Cannabis sativa extract increase appetite, food intake and meal frequency (101316, 101317). Other animal research in cisplatin-induced cachexia models shows that cannabigerol modestly increases food intake and reduces weight loss (101315).\nGenitourinary effects\nIn vitro research shows that cannabigerol decreases bladder contractions induced by acetylcholine but not those induced by electrical stimulation (101307).\nNeurologic effects\nIn vitro research in mouse brain membranes shows that cannabigerol blocks 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1 receptors and stimulates alpha-2-adrenoceptors. Cannabigerol has also been shown to bind to cannabinoid (CB)-1 and CB2 receptors, block CB1 receptors, and partially stimulate CB2 receptors (101318, 101322). Additional in vitro research shows weak partial agonist activity of cannabigerol at human CB1 and CB2 receptors, with a lower binding affinity at the CB1 receptor and a relatively high affinity at the CB2 receptor. However, these partial agonist effects suggest that cannabigerol may be functionally antagonistic at higher concentrations or in vivo (107341). By blocking 5-HT1A receptors, cannabigerol seems to reverse the anti-emetic effects of cannabidiol (101323). Some laboratory research also suggests that cannabigerol is a ligand of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) (110279, 110283).\n\nThere is interest in cannabigerol for neuroprotective effects in diseases such as Huntington disease. In vitro research in motor neurons shows that cannabigerol has neuroprotective effects by reducing markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The anti-inflammatory effects of cannabigerol seem to be greater when used with cannabidiol (101320, 104469). Animal research in Huntington disease models also shows that cannabigerol has neuroprotective effects, improves motor deficits, and preserves striatal neurons (101324). Additional animal research has demonstrated anti-nociceptive and anxiolytic-like effects of cannabigerol (107341)."

            "Overview": "Cannabinol, a mildly psychoactive cannabinoid and a metabolite of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is present in the Cannabis sativa plant in trace amounts (101665). Cannabinol may also be derived from cannabidiol (CBD), another cannabinoid. When CBD is exposed to temperatures typically occurring in e-cigarettes, it can be converted to cannabinol, as well as other cannabinoids (106103). There is interest in using cannabinol as an analgesic, appetite stimulant, immunomodulator, and sleep aid.",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Cannabinol at a dose of 20 mg daily has been used for up to 7 days without serious adverse effects (113055).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of cannabinol when used orally for more than 7 days.\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of cannabinol when used topically.",

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral or sublingual cannabinol (CBN) is beneficial in patients with insomnia.\nA clinical trial in adults with self-reported poor sleep quality shows that taking cannabinol (CBN) 20 mg 90 minutes before bed for 7 days, alone or in combination with cannabidiol (CBD), does not improve sleep quality compared with placebo. This study was likely underpowered to detect a difference between groups (113055).\n\nWhile CBN has been evaluated as monotherapy, studies have also examined its role in combination therapies. A large clinical trial in adults with self-reported sleep disturbances shows that taking CBN 15 mg in combination with CBD nightly for 4 weeks does not improve sleep disturbance scores when compared to melatonin 5 mg, CBD 15 mg, or combination regimens, such as CBN, CBD and melatonin (113051). However, an additional clinical trial in patients with self-reported insomnia shows that using an investigational drug (ZLT-101; Zelira Therapeutics) containing cannabinol 2 mg/mL, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 20 mg/mL, and CBD 1 mg/mL, taken as 0.5-1 mL sublingually one hour before sleep for 2 weeks, improves symptom severity and total sleep time when compared with placebo (108677). The validity of this finding is limited by the short duration of treatment. It is unclear if these findings are due to cannabinol, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if topical cannabinol (CBN) is beneficial for wound healing.\nA very small clinical study in healthy adults with a blister-induced wound shows that applying a cream containing unspecified doses of CBN daily for 14 days does not improve epidermal wound healing when compared with placebo (115992).

Additionally, cannabinol urine concentrations about 20 times greater than the minimum THC concentrations produce a positive THC signal on the Microgenics MultiGent assay (104476).\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with cannabinol.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAnimal research shows that the time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) after a single dose of cannabinol (1-100 mg/kg) ranges from 0.5 to 3 hours. The maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) exhibit dose dependent effects following single and repeated doses of cannabinol (113098, 115838). A small clinical study in cannabis users shows that smoking cannabinol 19 mg results in about a 40% bioavailability (101669).\nDistribution\nA small clinical study in cannabis users shows that the volume of distribution of intravenously administered cannabinol is about 50.5 L/kg (101669). Animal research shows that administration of cannabinol results in equivalent levels of cannabinol and its metabolite 11-hydroxy-cannabinol in brain tissue (115838).\nMetabolism\nIn vitro research shows that cannabinol is metabolized by hepatic microsomes. Specifically, cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) is involved in the 11-hydroxylation and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is involved in the 8-hydroxylation of cannabinol (101670).\nExcretion\nA small clinical study in cannabis users shows that the mean plasma clearance of intravenously administered cannabinol is about 19.1 mL/(min*kg). The terminal half-life was 32 hours after intravenous administration of cannabinol and 43 hours after smoking (101669).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCannabinol is a mildly psychoactive cannabinoid present in trace amounts in the cannabis plant. It is a metabolite of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Cannabinol binds to CB2 receptors and has a weak affinity for CB1 receptors (101652, 101664, 101665). However, some animal research shows that cannabinol has only negligible activity at CB2 receptors in the brain, but that its primary metabolite, 11-hydroxy-cannabinol, exhibits partial agonist activity at CB1 receptors (115838).\nAnalgesic effects\nThere is interest in using cannabinol for analgesia in various types of chronic pain. In vitro and animal research shows that cannabinol might increase analgesia by activating transient receptor potential ankyrin type-1 (TRPA1) channels and weakly binding to CB1 receptors (101652, 101664).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that cannabinol inhibits signaling pathways involved in inflammation, including the phosphorylated form of nuclear factor-kappa B (P-NF-ĸB) and STAT3, reducing pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and COX-2 (115483).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research on dental plaque samples obtained from healthy patients with stage 0, stage 3+, and stage 4 periodontal disease shows that cannabinol 12.5% reduces the colony count when compared with well-established synthetic toothpastes (107348).\nImmunologic effects\nSome in vitro research shows that cannabinol has immunosuppressive effects by binding to CB1 and CB2 on leukocytes and reducing T-cell lymphocyte humoral response (101666, 101667). However, other in vitro research shows that cannabinol might either increase or decrease the secretion of interleukin (IL)-2 from T-cells (101668).\nMetabolic effects\nAnimal research shows that cannabinol increases CB1 receptor-mediated behaviors such as increased feeding quantity and duration of intake. This suggests that cannabinol might increase appetite (101665).\nSleep effects\nCannabinol is of interest for potential effects on sleep (108677, 113051, 113055). Research in a rodent model shows that administration of cannabinol improves most measures of sleep quality. After administration of cannabinol, the metabolite 11-hydroxy-cannabinol exhibits partial agonist activity at CB1 receptors in the brain (115838)."

            "Overview": "Cannabis is an herbal drug produced from Cannabis sativa L., an annual herb believed to originate from Central Asia but now grown worldwide (91921). Cannabis contains more than 100 cannabinoids, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) (13, 62008, 96389).",
            "Warnings": "The 2018 federal Farm Bill defined cannabis as any product containing more than 0.3% THC (99608). In the US, cannabis is federally classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, making possession illegal. However, the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended that the Drug Enforcement Administration reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to III (113091). Additionally, although not currently sanctioned by the federal government, numerous states have legalized or decriminalized cannabis for medical and/or recreational use. Some countries such as Canada also permit the use of cannabis. Avoid confusion with hemp, a distinct variety of Cannabis sativa cultivated for its fiber and seeds. Unlike cannabis, hemp contains less than 0.3% THC (91922, 99608).\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using cannabis for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when a specific cannabis extract spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) is applied topically into the oral mucosa for up to 2 years. This product is available as a prescription drug in the UK and Canada; it is an investigational new drug in the US (61775, 61820, 89460, 89913, 111095).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally or inhaled in large amounts or for an extended duration. Edible cannabis products containing at least 50 mg of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) have been associated with cases of anxiety, psychosis, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmia (103796). Smoking or vaping cannabis can cause various respiratory problems such as coughing, wheezing, and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, and is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke (96378, 99581, 101420, 113092, 115363). E-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI) has occurred among adults and children who use e-cigarette, or vaping, products. The majority of patients with EVALI reported using THC-containing products, such as cannabis, in the 3 months prior to the development of symptoms (101421). Although it is possible that other ingredients, such as vitamin E acetate, may be involved in these cases of lung injury, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned the public to stop using all THC-containing vaping products due to the risk for EVALI (101429). Cannabis use has also been associated with seizures, cognitive impairment, and mood disturbances. Cessation of cannabis may precipitate cannabis withdrawal syndrome in up to 47% of regular users, the severity of which depends on the frequency and quantity of cannabis use prior to cessation (61896, 91909, 96378, 96381, 99588, 99576, 99580, 102801). Excessive and prolonged cannabis use, either by smoking and/or oral use, can lead to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). This condition is characterized by severe, repeat bouts of nausea and vomiting that cannot be alleviated by conventional antiemetics (99585, 99577). In several cases, CHS has been linked to severe complications resulting in death (99585).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of cannabis when used orally or via inhalation, short-term and in moderate amounts.\nPREGNANCY: UNSAFE when used orally or inhaled. Constituents in cannabis pass through the placenta and can reduce fetal growth and increase the risk for preterm birth (101425, 101481, 103792, 104490). Cannabis use during pregnancy is also associated with placental abruption, stillbirth, preterm delivery, fetal abnormalities, congenital birth defects of various organ systems, low birth weight, small for gestational age, increased need for neonatal intensive care, and childhood leukemia (4260, 25162, 61855, 96380, 101425, 101481, 101483, 108699, 113018, 115358). Prenatal cannabis use has also been associated with long-term adverse developmental effects in the offspring, such as worsened cognition, increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and increased risk for psychological issues during adolescence (103792, 104485, 115356). Due to the observational nature of these studies, it is unclear if cannabis causes these adverse effects. Umbilical artery Doppler scans also show that cannabis use can increase placental vascular resistance (101483). Cannabis use during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of anemia and hypertension in the mother (96380, 101481). The rate of negative fetal outcomes due to cannabis use during pregnancy may have been previously underestimated due to reliance on maternal self-reporting of use. Recent programs requiring maternal urine toxicology testing have increased awareness of maternal cannabis use and suggest that negative fetal outcomes occur more frequently than previously recorded (101481, 101482).\nLACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally or inhaled. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is concentrated and excreted in breast milk for longer than 6 weeks after cessation of cannabis use (2619, 2620, 104894). Prolonged cannabis use during lactation has been associated with delayed motor development (25163). Observational research in mothers who successfully abstained from cannabis use for 6 weeks (confirmed by a negative THC urine screen) after smoking cannabis prenatally at least twice weekly, found that THC levels in breastmilk increased during the first 2 weeks of abstinence and then decreased but remained detectable at 6 weeks (104894). For patients planning to breastfeed, recommend abstaining from cannabis use prenatally and during lactation. Recommendations to discard breastmilk until THC levels are undetectable are not practical, as this may take more than 6 weeks.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nWhen inhaled or used orally, cannabis can cause various adverse effects. A specific oromucosal spray containing cannabis extract (Sativex) seems to be well tolerated when used appropriately.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nAll ROAs: Dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, headache, increased appetite, nausea, paranoid and dissociative thinking, and sedation. Intoxicating doses can impair declarative memory, motor coordination, reaction time, and visual perceptions for up to 8 hours.\n\nInhaled: Upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as cough and wheeze.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nAll ROAs: Higher doses of cannabis might cause acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, myocarditis, blood pressure changes, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), hallucinations, pancreatitis, panic, psychosis, and seizures.\n\nInhaled: Upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia and drug-induced lung injury. Smoking cannabis daily is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, edible cannabis products reported to contain 50 mg or more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) have been associated with myocardial infarction (MI) and ventricular arrhythmia (103796). An epidemiological study in adults 18-74 years old suggests daily cannabis use is associated with a 25% increased odds of MI when compared with non-use, with lower odds for less than daily use, regardless of prior history of cigarette or e-cigarette use (113092). However, cannabis was smoked by 74% of respondents; it is unclear if this association applies to other routes of administration. A case-control study suggests that there is a 4.8-fold increased risk of MI within the first hour after smoking cannabis (91909). Also, there are cases of MI that have occurred soon after smoking cannabis, although this was reported to be triggered by physical activity in some regular cannabis users (61840, 96378, 104491, 111073, 111074). In many of these reports, it is unclear if the events were associated with cannabis use or other cardiovascular risk factors such as tobacco use and/or overweight (108692). However, there is at least one case following cannabis use that did not have any other notable cardiovascular risk factors. This 16-year-old healthy male presented with chest pain and an acute MI after smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol (99588). In another case, a 31-year-old male, who was a regular user of cannabis and had a previously undiagnosed myocardial bridge, presented with an MI (111073). In another case, a previously healthy 36-year-old male with a long-term history of cannabis use presented with a suspected spontaneous coronary artery dissection that resulted in cardiac arrest and cardiac catheterization (112924).\n\nCannabis has also been associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (91920, 96378, 104491, 108688). A meta-analysis of epidemiological research suggests that cannabis use is associated with a 29% higher odds of ACS (116443). In some cases, the causality is unclear because patients had other risk factors such as overweight, obesity, and/or tobacco use (91920). In other cases, acute coronary events occurred in young males with no other risk factors for cardiovascular disease besides smoking (96378, 108688). In one case report, ACS was linked to severe complications resulting in sudden cardiac death in a younger adult male with no past medical history (108688). Furthermore, in adults with existing coronary artery disease, the regular use of cannabis has been associated with ACS after physical activity (96378).\n\nOver 30 case reports suggest a causal relationship between cannabis use and ischemic stroke occurrence and/or recurrence (91913, 91915, 96378, 108694). A meta-analysis of epidemiological research suggests that cannabis use is associated with a 20% higher odds of stroke (116443). However, despite this association, evidence from prospective studies is needed to support the link. In many of the reported cases, the patients also regularly consumed alcohol and tobacco, which could have been additional contributing factors (91913, 91915). Other drugs of abuse may have also contributed. One epidemiological study in adults 18-44 years of age who were abusing multiple substances, mainly amphetamines and cocaine, suggests that the addition of cannabis use is associated with 76% higher odds of ischemic stroke (92665). Some studies also suggest that cannabis independently increases stroke risk. An epidemiologic study in young adults suggests that cannabis use within the last 30 days is associated with an 82% increased odds of stroke. The odds were increased further with frequent cannabis use, or with concomitant tobacco smoking or e-cigarette use (103025). Similarly, a larger epidemiological study in adults 18-74 years of age suggests daily cannabis use is associated with a 42% increased odds of stroke when compared with non-use, with lower odds for less than daily use, regardless of prior history of cigarette or e-cigarette use (113092). However, cannabis was smoked by 74% of respondents; it is unclear if this association applies to other routes of administration. Population research has also found that hospitalization related to ischemic stroke is increased by 17% in recreational users of cannabis; this increase is independent of other potential causes (96378). However, not all research has found a link between cannabis use and stroke. A case-control study in stroke patients suggests that cannabis use is not associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack when adjusted for tobacco use (92666). Another retrospective study in adults undergoing urine toxicology screening did not find an association between cannabis use and incidence of acute ischemic stroke over a 2-year period (104379).\n\nMeta-analyses of up to 3 observational studies in adults with recent total hip or knee arthroplasty suggest that a history of cannabis use is associated with a greater risk of postoperative cardiovascular complications, including thromboembolic events and cerebrovascular accidents, when compared with no history of cannabis use (115363).\n\nSmoking cannabis can cause a dose-dependent 20% to 100% increase in heart rate that begins within 10 minutes of smoking and lasts for 2-3 hours (61840, 92668, 96378, 96379). A retrospective study suggests that cannabis use, abuse, and dependence in teenagers is associated with cases of palpitations and arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation (103026). Smoking cannabis might cause tachycardia by inhibiting vagal tone or by stimulating beta-adrenergic receptors (92667, 92668, 96378). Also, smoking cannabis appears to cause orthostatic hypotension or, conversely, modestly increase blood pressure in patients who are supine (92669, 96378). Smoking cannabis has also been associated with 1 case of recurrent vasovagal syncope that required a dual chamber pacemaker implant and 6 cases of atrial fibrillation (96378, 112925). Many of these acute effects of smoking cannabis decrease after continued use for several days to a few weeks (92670). However, abrupt cessation of cannabis might also increase blood pressure (96378).\n\nCannabis use has also been associated with bradycardia. In one case, an elderly male accidentally ate 3 cannabis cookies with a recommended serving of one eighth of a cookie. The bradycardia resulted in dizziness and faintness and was nearly fatal (111084). Cannabis use has also been associated with sinus arrest and heart block. In a review highlighting 11 case reports of severe bradyarrhythmia associated with cannabis consumption, 3 were due to third-degree heart block, 2 were due to second-degree heart block, and 6 were due to sinus arrest (108684). In an additional case report, a 2-year-old boy developed bradycardia with first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block which lasted 12 hours after accidentally consuming an unknown number of cannabis gummies containing THC (110237).\n\nRegular use of cannabis has also been associated with cases of cannabis arteritis, a type of peripheral vascular disease, with some cases requiring amputation (61837, 91910, 108697, 111088, 116433). There is some disagreement over whether cannabis use contributes to the development of arteritis. A review of over 50 cases of arteritis associated with cannabis use suggests that tobacco use was prevalent in most cases. Since the clinical and pathological features of arteritis are the same as those of thromboangiitis obliterans, which is associated with tobacco use, there is limited evidence from these cases to suggest that cannabis is a causative factor for arteritis (61872, 96378). Still, symptoms worsened with use of cannabis in many cases, and disease progression was halted when cannabis was discontinued (96378). Additionally, there are reported cases of cannabis arteritis without concurrent tobacco use. In one case, cannabis arteritis was reported in a 31-year-old male with a 12-year history of cannabis use, in the absence of concurrent tobacco use. The patient reported a 3-year history of claudication symptoms, which coincided with a transition from smoking cannabis to vaping high-potency cannabis oil several times a day. Symptoms improved 4 weeks after cannabis cessation (116433). There is another case of cannabis arteritis in a middle-aged male who was not currently using tobacco; however, he smoked cannabis in blunt wraps, which contained nicotine. Symptoms resolved and did not recur following treatment with aspirin and nifedipine and avoidance of cannabis (111088). Cannabis discontinuation is recommended to prevent disease progression and avoid amputation (108697).\n\nCannabis use may be associated with myocarditis and myopericarditis. There have been at least 12 probable cases of myocarditis reported in the literature, usually based on temporal association and exclusion of other potential causes. In case reports, cannabis was used twice weekly for 3 months in one case and almost daily in others. Most individuals were males under 30 and recovered with treatment (110232, 110236, 111090, 112926). There is at least one case of acute myocarditis with pericarditis in a 26-year-old male who smoked cigarettes and vaped cannabis daily (111090).\n\nA case of ventricular bigeminy and a case of circulatory collapse have been considered to be related to treatment with a specific oromucosal spray containing THC and cannabidiol (CBD) (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) (61759, 61820).\n\nThere have also been several cases of rarer cardiovascular complications. A case of renal and spleen infarction following use of large amounts of cannabis and cocaine has been reported in a 24-year-old male with healthy arteries. The event may have been due to cannabis and cocaine-induced thrombosis (61889). A case of renal artery spontaneous dissection has also been reported (96378). Additionally, a case of spontaneous coronary artery dissection has been reported in a 61-year-old male with recent cannabis use and a history of hypertension (115366). There are at least 2 cases of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage associated with cannabis use, although, in both cases, contaminants and/or other drugs may have contributed (103018, 111072). Anecdotal reports of central retinal vein occlusion, limb ischemia, and acute thrombosis of aorta have also been associated with cannabis use (96378, 108694). The development of stress cardiomyopathy has been temporally related to the consumption of cannabis. In one patient, there was evidence of recurrence (96378). The development of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and cardioembolism has also been temporally related to the consumption of cannabis, as seen in a single case report describing a young male with no previous medical history (108689). There is also a single case report of pericardial effusion suspected to be related to vaping cannabis 1.5 mg daily, providing 95% THC, for 2 months. However, the presence of contaminants in the product could not be ruled out (110231).\nless\nDermatologic\nRarely, topical exposure to cannabis has resulted rarely in a rash and red, itchy skin (96389, 115374). In addition, there are at least 4 reported cases of contact dermatitis and 6 cases of contact urticaria due to cannabis. One of these cases involved airborne allergic contact dermatitis confirmed with patch testing in a 25-year-old male within 30-60 minutes of smoking medical cannabis (112927). Type IV sensitization to cannabis during occupational exposure was also confirmed via patch testing in a 24-year-old female with previously confirmed allergies to rye, grasses, mugwort, and nickel (115374).\n\nThere is at least one case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome thought to be associated with use of cannabis in a 32-year-old female (111078). A case of erythema multiforme-like recurrent drug eruption, characterized by the presence of erythematous, scaly, vesiculobullous, and targetoid rash, has been reported in a 19-year-old male who smoked cannabis for about a year prior to developing the condition. Discontinuation of cannabis improved the condition, but symptoms recurred once cannabis use was re-initiated (91918).\nless\nEndocrine\nSmall clinical studies suggest that smoking cannabis daily for 21 days increases caloric intake and causes weight gain in otherwise healthy adults who are heavy or casual cannabis smokers (92671). It is thought that cannabinoids in cannabis increase appetite by influencing the endogenous endocannabinoid system (61847). However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of chronic cannabis smoking on caloric intake and body weight (61847, 113019). Also, epidemiological research in the US has found that people with a history of cannabis use tend to have a lower body mass index when compared with never users (92672, 101489).\n\nOther epidemiological research suggests that cannabis use is associated with worsened glycemic control and an increased risk for serious complications in patients with diabetes. Observational research has found that people with type 1 diabetes that report recreational cannabis use have worsened glycemic control and a 2-fold increased risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) than those who do not report recreational cannabis use (99574, 100305, 100308). A case of recurrent DKA precipitated by cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome has also been reported in a 21-year-old female with type 1 diabetes who used cannabis regularly (112928). A cohort study in adults with type 2 diabetes suggests that cannabis use is associated with a higher risk for diabetic nephropathy, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial occlusion when compared with no cannabis use (100307). It is not clear if these associations are due to cannabis use or to a difference in lifestyle and self-care behaviors (100305, 100306). Risk-taking behaviors in general have been associated with worsened glycemic control and increased HbA1c (100308). More research is needed to clarify if a causal relationship exists between cannabis use and glycemic control.\n\nCannabis use has also been associated with at least 27 cases of acute pancreatitis (99582, 108686). In one case report, a 30-year-old female developed acute pancreatitis at two different time periods after increasing the frequency of smoking cannabis (99582).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nSmoking and ingesting cannabis can cause xerostomia, nausea, and vomiting (13, 18, 2619, 61896, 96384, 96813, 113016). Vaping cannabis has been reported to cause sore throat and bad taste in up to 35% of patients (101420). Cannabis has also been reported to cause oral candidiasis. There have been 2 case reports of tongue candidiasis attributed to dry mouth after heavy cannabis use (104487). A specific cannabis oromucosal spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) can cause dry mouth, nausea, and bad taste (61759, 61764, 61820, 61896, 61909, 108698). Less commonly, this cannabis product may cause red and white buccal mucosal patches to develop inside the mouth (61820). Clinical research in patients with chronic, cancer-related pain receiving prescription opioids has found that using this product for 2-5 weeks increases nausea by 43% and vomiting by 50% when compared with opioid treatment alone (108676).\n\nExcessive and prolonged cannabis use (2-3 times daily over 2 years) can lead to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). This condition is characterized by cyclic attacks of nausea and vomiting, often accompanied by abdominal pain. CHS does not seem to be alleviated by conventional antiemetic medicine (99585, 101423, 101424, 111076, 111080, 111083, 112929, 115046, 115372, 115375)(116441). Some patients experiencing CHS report using extremely hot baths to temporarily reduce symptoms. In one case, the extreme water temperature caused repeated burns, resulting in sepsis and hospitalization (99585, 101423, 101424, 111076, 111080). Symptoms of CHS resolve only after a sustained period of abstaining from cannabis use (99585, 101423, 115046). CHS can also sometimes precipitate hypophosphatemia, which has been attributed to hyperventilation during CHS (99577, 115375). CHS has been linked to severe complications such as electrolyte imbalances. There is at least one case of nephrolithiasis in a young adult with a history of daily cannabis use and nephrolithiasis. The nephrolithiasis was thought to be related to CHS-associated dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (111091). CHS was also reported to precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in a 21-year-old female with type 1 diabetes who regularly used cannabis (112928). Additionally, CHS was reported to cause thiamine deficiency resulting in Wernicke encephalopathy in a 16-year-old male with chronic cannabis use. Symptoms improved following thiamine supplementation (116441). There is also a case report of superior mesenteric artery syndrome in an adolescent female thought to be precipitated by rapid weight loss due to recurrent CHS (116449). There are 3 case reports of young adults chronically using cannabis that died from complications of cannabis use and CHS (99585).\n\nChronic cannabis use has also been associated with several cases of intussusception; however a causal mechanism and link has not been determined (103028). There are at least 22 reported cases of adult intussusception, with associated abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, possibly associated with the chronic use of cannabis. Most cases resolved spontaneously; however, some required laparoscopic/manual reductions (110233). Intussusception has been also reported in an infant with chronic passive exposure to cannabis via breastfeeding (116456).\n\nAlthough laboratory research has suggested that cannabis use can decrease gastrointestinal motility, observational research suggests that cannabis use is associated with 30% reduced odds of constipation and no change in the likelihood for diarrhea (101485).\n\nIn one case report, a 26-year-old male with a 6-month history of daily cannabis use required cholecystectomy for gangrenous acalculous cholecystitis, presenting as persistent abdominal pain and intractable vomiting (115381).\nless\nGenitourinary\nThe chronic use of cannabis can cause abnormal menstruation (18). Cannabis use has been associated with priapism in a few case reports. There is also some speculation that cannabis use might precipitate a priapism attack in patients with sickle cell trait (99584). However, it is too early to know if a causal relationship exists.\n\nMeta-analyses of 3 observational studies in adults with recent total hip or knee arthroplasty suggests that a history of cannabis use is associated with a greater risk of postoperative urinary tract infections when compared with no history of cannabis use (115363).\nless\nHematologic\nA few cases of intracerebral hemorrhage have been associated with cannabis use. In some but not all cases, reversible vasoconstriction syndrome was associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (96800). Some population research suggests that cannabis use is associated with an 18% increased risk of developing an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, independent of other risk factors. However, other population research does not support these findings (96378).\n\nMeta-analyses of up to 4 observational studies in adults with recent total hip or knee arthroplasty suggests that a history of cannabis use is associated with a greater risk of postoperative thromboembolic events, as well as a greater need for postoperative transfusions, when compared with no history of cannabis use (115363). Additionally, a retrospective chart review in adults undergoing chest masculinization surgery suggests that a history of cannabis use is associated with 3.5-fold greater odds of postoperative hematoma when compared with no cannabis use (115378).\nless\nHepatic\nThere is at least one case of acute hepatitis likely related to the chronic use of cannabis (110234).\n\nIntravenously, cannabis may cause toxic hepatitis (61705).\nless\nImmunologic\nOral, topical, and occupational exposure to cannabis has been associated with reports of sensitization and allergic reactions. More than one allergen in cannabis may be responsible. Exposure to cannabis smoke can also cause nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, coughing, and wheezing, possibly related to an allergic response in some individuals (96389, 116450).\n\nCases of topical and airborne contact dermatitis have been reported after cannabis exposure (112927, 115374). There has also been at least one case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (111078) and a case of erythema multiforme-like eruption (91918) thought to be associated with cannabis use. Additionally, an asthma attack has been reported in a 51-year-old male who inhaled cannabis seeds (61813).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nMeta-analyses of up to 3 observational studies in adults with recent total hip or knee arthroplasty suggests that a history of cannabis use is associated with a greater risk of postoperative surgical revision, dislocation, mechanical loosening of prosthesis, periprosthetic fracture, and infection when compared with no history of cannabis use (115363).\n\nChronic use of large amounts of cannabis has been associated with alterations in bone metabolism. In one case report, a 56-year-old male patient who had smoked up to 7 grams of cannabis daily for 25 years presented with osteoporosis and multiple vertebral crush fractures (92673).\n\nA 26-year-old male developed hypokalemia-induced progressing paralysis, followed by rhabdomyolysis, thought to be related to recreational cannabis use (110238).\n\nOrally, in children ages 12 years and younger, accidental ingestion of cannabis-containing edibles has been associated with ataxia, tremors, hypotonia, hypothermia, nystagmus, respiratory depression, and seizures (103793). Legalization of recreational cannabis has been associated with an increased rate of poisoning from cannabis edibles (104492).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nSmoking, vaping, or ingesting cannabis can cause headache, dizziness, numbness, disorientation, somnolence, and fatigue (17371, 61896, 96384, 96813, 101420, 113016, 116435, 116438). Recurrent, strong headaches associated with cannabis use might be related to reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). In one cohort, 32% of individuals with RCVS were cannabis users (96378). Meta-analyses of 2 observational studies in adults with recent total hip or knee arthroplasty suggests that a history of cannabis use is associated with a greater risk of postoperative cerebrovascular accidents when compared with no history of cannabis use (115363).\n\nIntoxicating doses of cannabis impair reaction time, motor coordination, declarative memory, and visual perceptions, and can also produce panic reactions and other emotional disturbances. An individual's driving ability can be impaired for up to 8 hours (18, 61896, 103023). One small clinical trial shows that inhaling vaporized cannabis containing delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 10 mg, alone or with cannabidiol (CBD) 10-30 mg, modestly impairs verbal recall (110242). A small prospective study has found that inhaling vaporized cannabis containing THC 13.75 mg or THC/cannabidiol 13.75 mg increases lane weaving for the first 100 minutes when compared with placebo. This impairment was comparable to that of a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05%, which is considered to indicate clinically relevant impairment (104482). The validity of this finding is limited because the study only tested a single dose of cannabis, which does not mimic typical real-world use (104484). Acute use of cannabis has also been associated with increased motor collision risk (61911, 61904), especially if the driver is using alcohol or other drugs concomitantly (103024). Two retrospective studies suggest that state-based legalization and commercialization of cannabis is associated with increased traffic fatalities. Based on this data, experts predict that nationwide cannabis legalization could result in 6,800 more traffic fatalities per year. The increase in traffic fatalities may vary state to state. For example, one study found an increase in fatalities in Colorado but not in Washington state (103022, 103024, 103027). These studies are limited due to their retrospective nature and a lack of control over other confounding factors such as out-of-state cannabis tourism that could have affected driving fatalities.\n\nInhalation of highly potent cannabis might sometimes cause intoxication similar to serotonin syndrome. In 2 case reports, patients presented to the emergency room with dilated pupils, lower extremity rigidity, and clonus after smoking a highly potent form of cannabis (103016). Another case reports a 20-year-old male taking cannabis and fluoxetine who presented with 2 episodes of serotonin syndrome that were not correlated to changes in fluoxetine administration (112923).\n\nTwo cases of paralysis secondary to hypokalemia are reported, likely due to coupling of cannabinoid receptors to potassium channels; both patients had complete resolution of symptoms after potassium replacement (110238, 112930).\n\nWhen smoked chronically and in large amounts, cannabis might cause seizures. Two cases report adult males smoking cannabis, one in the form of \"moon rock,\" who presented with secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures that were managed with medications (99580, 113013). Additionally, there have been 2 cases of new-onset seizures in pediatric patients reported after accidental ingestion of cannabis-containing edibles (103794).\n\nCannabis-induced acute encephalopathy has been found in a 94-year-old female given cannabis by a family member. The cannabis had been marketed as being pure cannabidiol (CBD); however, a urinary analysis tested positive for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Symptoms included confusion and disorientation, hallucinations, and diarrhea (111071). A case of acute hippocampal encephalopathy has been reported in a 24-year-old male with a history of heavy cannabis use (8 to 10 joints daily for 6 years) who presented to the emergency department with a nonfebrile status epilepticus and diminished consciousness, requiring intubation and admission to the intensive care unit (115379). Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have also been reported (116434). Additionally, Wernicke encephalopathy has been reported in a 16-year-old male, with cannabis hyperemesis syndrome identified as the underlying cause of his thiamine deficiency. Symptoms improved following thiamine supplementation (116441).\n\nIn one case report, early-onset frontotemporal dementia resulting in extreme behaviors (e.g., eating inedible objects, incontinence, mutism) was visualized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a 34-year-old male after 2 years of cannabis use; psychiatric and other neurodegenerative diagnoses were ruled out (113011).\n\nLong-term use of cannabis can cause cognitive impairment, affecting executive function, learning and memory, and global cognition, that lasts longer than the period of acute intoxication (10242, 61844, 101488). These cognitive impairments develop slowly and worsen as the years of cannabis use increase, with some research suggesting they become clinically significant after about 2 decades of use (10242).\n\nUsing oromucosal spray containing cannabis extract (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, sleepiness, and fatigue (61759, 61764, 61820, 61896, 61909, 96814). Two clinical studies in adults with cancer show that non-inhaled medical cannabis has a negative effect on mental concentration when compared with control (115355).\n\nLimited research shows that consuming large amounts of CBD might increase the adverse effects of THC. A small study in healthy adults shows that consumption of brownies containing THC 20 mg plus cannabidiol (CBD) 640 mg increases feelings of sedation and memory impairment when compared to consuming brownies containing only THC 20 mg (111092).\n\nProspective, observational research in children who were 12 years old at the time of enrollment suggests that cannabis use is associated with poorer sleep quality at 18 years of age. Additionally, more recent use at age 18 years was associated with a greater reduction in sleep quality (101428). In children ages 12 years and younger, accidental ingestion of cannabis-containing edibles has been associated with lethargy, seizures, and coma (103793, 103794). Legalization of recreational cannabis has been associated with an increased rate of poisoning from cannabis edibles (104492).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nThe use of inhaled cannabis can cause a characteristic reddening of the eyes (2619, 96389). Smoking cannabis can also cause dry eyes (17371). Acute poisoning from cannabis can cause lacrimation (18). Orally, in children ages 12 years and younger, accidental ingestion of cannabis-containing edibles has been associated with nystagmus (103793, 103794). A case of bilateral optic neuropathy was reported in a 28-year-old male, 8 hours after smoking cannabis and cigarettes. Treatment involved high-dose corticosteroids, aspirin, and complete abstinence from cannabis use (115368). There is also a case of retinal arterial macroaneurysm rupture causing vision loss and requiring surgery in a 17-year-old male thought to be associated with cannabis consumption the previous day (116457).\n\nObservational research suggests that cannabis use at least once per month increases the risk for tinnitus. The severity of tinnitus does not appear to be correlated to the quantity or frequency of cannabis use (101486).\nless\nOncologic\nThere is some concern that cannabis use increases the risk for cancer. A meta-analysis of observational case-control studies suggests that cannabis is not associated with an increased risk for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or oral cancer. However, more than 10 years of cannabis use is associated with an increased risk for testicular germ cell tumor (101430).\n\nAny correlation between cannabis use and lung cancer risk is unclear. Evidence from a case-control study suggests that smoking cannabis increases the risk of lung cancer by 8% for each joint-year of smoking (61829). However, other observational research did not find an association between duration, intensity, or cumulative smoking of cannabis and lung cancer (99590). A meta-analysis of case-control studies could not clarify this association due to the poor methodological quality and reporting of the available research (101430). More data is needed to determine if there is a link between specific types of lung cancer and smoking cannabis.\n\nTwo observational studies in adults with cancer who were receiving immunotherapy suggest that using cannabis and/or cannabinoids may worsen outcomes. In one observational study, adults with advanced cancer who used cannabis had a shorter time to cancer progression and shorter average overall survival. In a retrospective review, adults with advanced cancer who used cannabis had similar progression and survival rates, but a reduced response to immunotherapy treatment (115047).\nless\nPsychiatric\nWhen used short-term, smoking cannabis or using oromucosal spray containing cannabis extract (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) can cause anxiety or paranoid thinking or dissociation (61896, 96814). One small clinical trial shows that inhaling vaporized cannabis containing delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 10 mg, alone or with cannabidiol (CBD) 10-30 mg, modestly induces psychotic symptoms (110242). However, a single dose of inhaled cannabis containing an increased ratio of CBD to THC seems to result in reduced feelings of anxiety when compared to a higher ratio of THC to cannabidiol (110254).\n\nVaporized cannabis also seems to reduce motivation. In a clinical study in healthy adults, inhaling vaporized cannabis containing 8 mg THC with or without CBD 10 mg and repeating half the dose 1.5 hours later, reduces motivation when compared to placebo (99583).\n\nThe chronic use of cannabis can cause apathy, psychic decline, psychosis, and sexual dysfunction (18, 113013). Cannabinoids can increase anxiety, confusion, and hallucinations (96384).\n\nCannabis use can be habit-forming. Meta-analyses of the available research suggest that as many as 47% of regular cannabis users develop some form of dependence, and up to 9% of all users develop cannabis use disorder (101701, 102801). Another meta-analysis of clinical and observational studies suggests that the prevalence of cannabis use disorder is 25% among individuals who use medicinal cannabis (115360). An additional meta-analysis of observational research suggests that the risk of cannabis use disorder is positively associated with frequency of use (110228). In patients with cannabis dependence, cessation of use can precipitate cannabis withdrawal within 1-2 days. The risk for cannabis withdrawal syndrome seems to be greater in males, those with higher cannabis use, and those with concomitant drug or tobacco use (102801). Symptoms of cannabis use withdrawal typically last for 7-14 days and include irritability, nervousness, difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite, and depressed mood. Physical symptoms such as stomach pain, tremors, sweating, fever, or headache might also occur. In one case report, abrupt withdrawal from chronic cannabis use precipitated cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (116447). Severity of withdrawal varies, and largely depends on the cumulative amount of cannabis used prior to cessation (99576, 101702). Withdrawal symptoms may be particularly problematic in individuals with pre-existing depression or anxiety, resulting in failed cessation attempts (102801). Additionally, psychosis has been reported as a withdrawal symptom (110227, 115382, 116436). In these cases, psychosis was reported within a few days of abrupt cannabis withdrawal, following a history of daily use over a period of years (110227, 115382, 116436). In one case series, major symptoms resolved within 2 weeks although some minor symptoms remained in most patients (116436).\n\nObservational and population research suggests that using cannabis is associated with increased risk of developing psychotic symptoms or a psychotic condition, particularly in males and/or patients with preexisting psychosis propensity (61810, 61812, 61850, 61873, 61888, 61891, 96381, 108687, 111097). One case report also suggested a potential relationship between cannabis use and antepartum psychosis in a patient with pre-eclampsia (115377). This increased risk for psychosis might be attributed to the THC content in cannabis (103021, 108687). Observational research suggests that cannabis use is associated with about a 2-fold increased risk of psychosis when compared to never using cannabis (96381). Case-control observational research suggests that cannabis use is associated with a 3-fold increased risk for a first-episode psychosis; daily use of high-potency cannabis was associated with a nearly five-fold increased risk for first-episode psychosis when compared with never using cannabis (101426). Similarly, a meta-analysis of observational research in adolescents suggests that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychosis, with an even greater risk observed in adolescents with a history of childhood trauma, heavier and more frequent use, and those who began using at an earlier age (108687).\n\nCannabis may also increase the risk of relapse in patients with psychotic disorders, with longer hospital admissions and more severe symptoms compared with nonusers and discontinued users (61848, 96382). Furthermore, using cannabis appears to be associated with a 3-fold increased risk of new onset mania (91912). Cannabis use, usually heavy, has also been associated with cases of catatonia in children and adults with or without a previous history of psychiatric illness (104493, 104494, 108683, 111086, 113012, 115365). In two of these cases, management with electroconvulsive therapy and lorazepam was successful (113012, 115365).\n\nUse of cannabis is associated with depression, panic attacks, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and suicide ideation/attempt. In one case, a 32-year-old male chronic cannabis user of about 10 years developed panic attacks. His symptoms had started about 2 years previously. He had recently abstained from cannabis use and had no past history of mental illness (111077). In one case, a 22-year-old male with no previous psychiatric history developed symptoms of OCD after 2-3 months of consistent cannabis use, with worsening of symptoms when cannabis use increased. Symptoms disappeared when the patient abstained from use and recurred when use resumed (115361). Use of cannabis, at least once weekly, has been associated with an increased risk of developing depression. In patients with depression, cannabis use is associated with worsened symptoms and increased suicidal ideation. However, due to the retrospective nature of these studies it is not clear whether depression resulted in increased cannabis use or if the cannabis use worsened or triggered depression. Having depression is associated with an increased odds of cannabis use, especially more frequent daily use, when compared with people without depression (91916, 99575, 104488, 115362). Population research also suggests that using cannabis is associated with 24% increased odds of anxiety when compared to never using cannabis (96386). A meta-analysis of 6 prospective observational studies in adolescents with no pre-existing physical or mental health disorders suggests that cannabis use is associated with 2-fold greater odds of developing an anxiety disorder when compared with adolescents without cannabis exposure (115359). Additionally, clinical research in adults with cancer shows that higher doses of synthetic THC increase the likelihood of anxiety events by about 2-fold when compared with lower doses (115355).\n\nObservational research in young adult chronic cannabis users suggests that smoking high potency cannabis, containing 10% or more of THC, is associated with greater risk of anxiety when compared with smoking lower potency cannabis (103795). The increased anxiety might also contribute to the 2-fold higher odds of youth violence seen with cannabis use when compared with non-use (104486). A meta-analysis of observational research in individuals aged 11-21 years suggests that cannabis smoking is associated with an approximate 2-fold increased risk of both suicidal ideation and attempt when compared with non-cannabis smoking (110229). Similarly, a meta-analysis of 15 observational studies in individuals aged 10-24 years suggests that recurrent cannabis use is associated with a 1.6 greater odds of suicidal ideation when compared with non-use (115357). Similarly, a large observational study of hospitalized adolescents suggests that cannabis use disorder is associated with a 40% increased odds of suicide attempt or self-harm (113015). Between 2009 and 2021, over 18,000 intentional, suspected suicidal cannabis exposures were reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) in children and adults aged 5 years and up. Death or another major outcome occurred in approximately 10% of all cases and in 19% of adults aged 65 years and up. Almost all cases occurred in individuals using at least one additional substance; therefore, a direct link cannot be made between cannabis use and attempted suicide (110324).\n\nWhen consumed in large amounts, edible cannabis products containing at least 50 mg of THC have been associated with anxiety, abnormal behavior, psychosis, and suicidal tendencies (91914, 103796). A case of erratic speech and hostile behaviors, followed by suicidal actions resulting in death, has been reported in a 19-year-old male who consumed an edible cannabis cookie. According to the product's label, the serving size should have been one-sixth of the cookie. This serving size would have contained 10 mg of THC. However, the decedent ate the entire cookie after not experiencing effects within 30-60 minutes of the initial dose (91914). Due to this case and other cases of overconsumption of edible cannabis products, in February 2015 the state of Colorado began requiring that edible cannabis products contain no more than 10 mg of THC per serving or that the products have clear demarcation of each 10-mg serving if they contain more than 10 mg of THC (91914). Additionally, a small study in healthy adults shows that oral consumption of brownies containing THC 20 mg plus cannabidiol (CBD) 640 mg increases feelings of anxiety, paranoia, and irritability, when compared to consuming brownies containing only THC 20 mg (111092).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nSmoking or vaping cannabis can cause cough and bronchodilation (17371, 61799, 96378, 96389, 99581, 101420). At least 5 cases of pneumomediastinum have been reported (61915, 108679, 110235, 113014). These cases occurred in patients aged 19 to 27 years. In one case, cannabis was smoked the evening before symptoms occurred and in the others, cannabis was smoked daily or chronically; all cases made significant recoveries (61915, 108679, 110235, 113014). There are also cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis related to the use of cannabis; corticosteroid treatment resulted in resolution (111089, 116445).\n\nWhen smoked long-term, cannabis can cause laryngitis, bronchitis, phlegm, wheezing, and coughing (18, 61799, 61811, 61855, 96378, 99581, 110321). Using oromucosal spray containing cannabis extract may cause pharyngitis, hoarseness, and throat irritation (61759).\n\nAcute eosinophilic pneumonia has been reported in at least four cases (110240, 110241). A 21-year-old male reported using 20 homemade cannabis joints the evening before symptom onset which included respiratory distress and abdominal pain. An 88-year-old male developed cough and dyspnea after using 3 cannabis joints daily for 2 months to control pain (110240, 110241). Acute respiratory distress syndrome was reported in a 25-year-old male with a history of smoking both cannabis and methamphetamine (115367). Chronic use of cannabis has also been associated with several cases of an unusual pattern of bullous emphysema (1395, 61814, 110235, 115373). A healthy 17-year-old male with a history of illicit substance use was diagnosed with cannabis-induced thermal epiglottitis after presenting with acute airway obstruction (108682). In one case report, a 51-year-old male presented with drug-induced lung injury following daily cannabis smoking for over 20 years (111094). Heavy, chronic cannabis smoking has also been associated with a case of isolated pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis in a 16-year-old male presenting with recurrent, spontaneous bilateral pneumothoraxes and cystic lesions on pulmonary imaging (108693). In another case, a small apical pneumothorax occurred in a 20-year-old male with a history of disordered cannabis use (110235). Similarly, spontaneous right-sided pneumothorax with bilateral apical blebs was reported in a 23-year-old male with a 5-year history of daily cannabis smoking (115048). Additionally, recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, and multiple apical blebs were reported in a 26-year-old male with a 10-12-year history of smoking cannabis 7 grams daily (115371).\n\nMeta-analyses of 2 observational studies in adults with recent total hip or knee arthroplasty suggests that a history of cannabis use is associated with a greater risk of postoperative pneumonia and respiratory failure when compared with no history of cannabis use (115363).\n\nRegular smoking of 3-4 cannabis cigarettes per day is reported to produce symptoms and airway histological effects similar to those seen with an average tobacco cigarette use of 20-22 per day (1395). A small clinical trial shows that inhaling a high-grade cannabis (Bedrocan International B.V., Veendam, The Netherlands) 100 mg, containing THC 21.8% and cannabinol 0.1%, does not produce respiratory depression (111096).\n\nAny correlation between cannabis use and lung cancer risk is unclear. Evidence from a case-control study suggests that smoking cannabis increases the risk of lung cancer by 8% for each joint-year of smoking (61829). However, other observational research did not find an association between duration, intensity, or cumulative smoking of cannabis and lung cancer (99590). A meta-analysis of case-control studies could not clarify this association due to the poor methodological quality and reporting of the available research (101430). More data is needed to determine if there is a link between specific types of lung cancer and smoking cannabis.\n\nOrally, in children ages 12 years and younger, accidental ingestion of cannabis-containing edibles has been associated with respiratory depression (103793, 103794). In one case, a 5-week-old infant exposed to cannabis in utero and via breastmilk experienced recurrent apneic episodes. After switching to infant formula, the apnea improved (115370).\nless\nRenal\nAcute kidney injury has been reported after oral cannabis use. In one case, it was likely caused by pre-existing mild dehydration related to a lack of fluid intake, followed by cannabis-induced diarrhea (111071). Meta-analyses of 2 observational studies in adults with recent total hip or knee arthroplasty suggests that a history of cannabis use is associated with a greater risk of postoperative acute kidney injury when compared with no cannabis use (115363).\n\nAcute eosinophilic pneumonia with acute renal failure has been reported in a 21-year-old male who reported using 20 homemade cannabis joints the evening before symptom onset (110240).\n\nCannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is characterized by cyclic attacks of nausea and vomiting, often accompanied by abdominal pain (99585, 101423, 101424). CHS has been linked to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. There is at least one case of nephrolithiasis in a young adult with a history of daily cannabis use and nephrolithiasis. The nephrolithiasis was thought to be related to CHS-associated dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (111091).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). A foreign prescription drug spray (Sativex) and oral cannabis extract seem to modestly reduce spasticity in patients with MS. It is unknown if inhaled cannabis is beneficial.\nA meta-analysis of several clinical studies in patients with MS shows that using a specific oromucosal spray containing cannabis extract (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals), standardized to deliver delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.7 mg and cannabidiol (CBD) 2.5 mg per actuation, for at least 3 weeks modestly reduces subjective spasticity, but does not seem to reduce neuropathic pain or bladder dysfunction, when compared with placebo (104895). Similarly, another meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies, that includes many of the same studies as the prior meta-analysis, shows that using Sativex as add-on therapy improves the likelihood of reduced spasticity by 2.4 times when compared with placebo (113020). Limited research suggests that the benefit of Sativex might last for over 11 months and withdrawal of Sativex may cause a rebound of MS symptoms (89923, 89924). Sativex has been approved in the United Kingdom as a prescription medicine to treat MS-related spasticity (89913) and in Canada to treat neuropathic pain associated with MS (61775). This product has not been approved in the United States. The American Academy of Neurology states that Sativex does not improve objective measures of spasticity, reduce the number of urinary incontinence episodes, or reduce MS-related tremors (89460). Notably, much of the research was funded by the manufacturer.\n\nOral cannabis extracts have also been studied. A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with MS shows that taking a cannabis extract containing THC 25-30 mg and CBD 8-18 mg daily for up to 15 weeks modestly reduces subjective spasticity, neuropathic pain, and bladder dysfunction when compared with placebo. However, objective spasticity measures (Ashworth scale) were not improved when compared with placebo (104895). Two of the largest studies included in the meta-analysis used a specific cannabis extract (Cannador, Society for Clinical Research) (11168, 91919). A third study used cannabis extract standardized to THC 2.5 mg and CBD 0.9 mg per capsule, for an escalating daily dose of 6-12 capsules in 3 divided doses (61746). One small clinical study in patients with MS with upper limb tremors shows that taking a specific cannabis extract (Cannador) titrated to a maximum of THC 0.125 mg/kg twice daily for 2 weeks does not appear to improve tremor when compared with placebo (61739).\n\nIt is unclear if SMOKING cannabis improves MS symptoms. Epidemiological research suggests that smoking cannabis is associated with reduced muscle spasms, pain in the extremities, and tremors associated with MS (11167).\n\nRecent clinical practice guidelines for the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for the management of chronic pain strongly recommend the use of cannabinoid-based medicines as adjunct treatment for improvement of pain, muscle spasm, and sleep in patients with MS and inadequate response to other treatments. These recommendations are based on low or moderate quality evidence of smoked cannabis, cannabis extract, and oromucosal THC, suggesting that benefits exceed the risks of non-serious adverse effects. The strongest evidence of benefit has been shown with oils and capsules, as opposed to smoking or oromucosal formulations. A total daily dose of THC 10-15 mg was most commonly used in clinical research. Initiating treatment with a low dose reduces the risk of adverse effects (110321).\nless\nNeuropathic pain. Inhaled cannabis seems to temporarily reduce neuropathic pain in some patients, although the optimal dose remains unclear.\nA meta-analysis of five small clinical studies shows that inhaling cannabis providing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in doses of approximately 1.6-96 mg daily for up to 2 weeks reduces the intensity of neuropathic pain caused by HIV, trauma, diabetes, chemotherapy, and other conditions (96383). Six patients with chronic neuropathic pain would need to inhale THC-containing cannabis for one patient to experience a pain reduction of at least 30% (96383). A small clinical trial also shows that inhaling cannabis containing 2.9% or 6.7% THC reduces neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury. About 3 patients would need to inhale cannabis during an 8-hour period for one person to achieve a pain reduction of at least 30%. Pain relief was immediate, but lasted less than 2 hours (96379). Cannabis has been smoked, vaporized, or inhaled from gelatin capsules in a pipe (17371, 61800, 61833, 61846, 96383, 96388, 96379). There is speculation that smoking cannabis may relieve chronic neuropathic pain similar to gabapentin, but high-quality research is needed to confirm (96383).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlcohol use disorder. It is unclear if smoked cannabis with a high concentration of cannabidiol is beneficial for reducing alcohol use in patients with alcohol use disorder.\nObservational research in people with alcohol use disorder suggests that smoking 1-3 grams of cannabis flower containing about 24% cannabidiol (CBD) and 1% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) over 5 days is associated with reduced alcohol use when compared with smoking cannabis with equal parts CBD (10%) and THC (9%) or higher THC (24%) than CBD (1%) (105496). This study is limited by its observational nature and short duration.\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if sublingual cannabis improves behavior in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking sublingual cannabis extract (Bedrocan, Bedrocan International BV, Veendam, The Netherlands) 0.5 to 1 mL twice daily for 12 weeks modestly improves appetite, mood, and behavior, including aggression, when compared to baseline. There were also some modest improvements in some, but not all, cognitive outcomes. The cannabis extract contained 0.5% cannabidiol and 22% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (111085). This study is limited by its small size and lack of control treatment.\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). It is unclear if smoking cannabis improves symptoms of ALS.\nPopulation research in patients with ALS has found that smoking cannabis is associated with improved appetite and reduced depression, pain, spasms, and drooling (61737).\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if non-inhaled cannabis is beneficial for anxiety.\nA review of five clinical studies in adults with cancer shows that non-inhaled medical cannabis does not reduce the severity of anxiety symptoms when compared with control (115355).\nless\nBlepharospasm. It is unclear if oral cannabis extract is beneficial for blepharospasm previously unresponsive to botulism toxin injections.\nA very small clinical trial in adults with blepharospasm unsuccessfully treated with botulism toxin A injections shows that using a cannabis extract containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 3.2% (1 drop estimated to contain 1.2 mg), titrated to a maximum of 10 drops, nightly for 12 weeks improves the frequency, duration, and severity of eyelid spasm attacks when compared with placebo (108691). The validity of this study is limited by poor study design and lack of follow-up.\nless\nCachexia. It is unclear if oral cannabis extract improves appetite in patients with cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome.\nOne clinical study shows that using a cannabis extract standardized to contain delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.5 mg and cannabidiol (CBD) 1 mg twice daily for 6 weeks does not increase appetite when compared with placebo in patients with cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome (61785). However, the substantial placebo effect and dropout rate limits the reliability of these findings.\nless\nCancer-related anorexia. It is unclear if non-inhaled cannabis is beneficial for cancer-related anorexia.\nA meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies in adults with cancer shows that non-inhaled medical cannabis increases the odds of improved self-reported appetite and reduces the severity of appetite loss when compared with control (115355).\nless\nCancer-related pain. It is unclear if oral or inhaled cannabis products are beneficial for patients with cancer-related pain. The evidence is mixed.\nClinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology conclude that evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against the use of cannabis to manage cancer-related pain (115047). Conversely, a 2021 British Medical Journal clinical practice guideline states that the evidence weakly supports a trial of non-inhaled medical cannabis in conjunction with standard pain management in individuals with moderate to severe chronic pain and insufficient pain relief. The recommendation is based on research in studies using non-inhaled medical cannabis products containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) for 1-4 months showing modest improvements in pain, physical function, and sleep, but not emotional, role, or social functions, when compared with standard treatment alone (108676, 108698). However, the recommendations suggest using products providing specific doses of THC and CBD and do not recommend inhaled cannabis or other oral cannabis products (108698). For more information on the specific doses of THC and CBD, see the individual monographs for these cannabinoids.\n\nA specific oromucosal cannabis extract spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals), standardized to deliver delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.7 mg and cannabidiol (CBD) 2.5 mg per actuation, has also been evaluated. Meta-analyses of up to 5 clinical studies in patients with chronic, cancer-related pain receiving prescription opioids show that using this spray for 2-5 weeks does not improve prescribed opioid consumption, sleep, or pain. One meta-analysis shows that taking this spray actually increases nausea and vomiting by 43% and 50%, respectively, when compared with opioids alone (108676, 111095). All studies instructed patients not to alter the prescribed opioid dose, which may have increased the risk for adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if oral cannabis or an oromucosal cannabis extract spray are beneficial for the prevention of CINV.\nClinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology weakly recommend that adults who are experiencing refractory CINV despite the use of recommended antiemetic prophylaxis may consider adding a prescription cannabinoid, such as nabilone or dronabinol, or a quality-controlled oral extract providing equal parts delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), to their antiemetic regimen (115047).\n\nA small crossover study in adults receiving moderately-to-highly emetogenic chemotherapy who are still experiencing CINV despite conventional antiemetic prophylaxis shows that taking a cannabis extract (TN-TC11M) containing THC 2.5 mg and CBD 2.5 mg 3 times daily during chemotherapy prevents CINV in 25% of patients, compared with 14% of patients receiving placebo. The extract was started the day before chemotherapy and continued for 7 days (104489). In a pre-specified analysis limited to the first cycle of chemotherapy in these and additional patients, taking this extract prevents CINV in 24% of patients, compared with 8% of patients receiving placebo (116438). Collectively, these studies suggest that 7-9 patients must be treated with this cannabis extract in order to prevent CINV in one person. Limited research has also evaluated a specific cannabis extract oromucosal spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) standardized to deliver THC 2.7 mg and CBD 2.5 mg per actuation. A very small clinical study shows that when used in addition to a standard antiemetic regimen, 1-3 sprays after each daily chemotherapy infusion and then up to 8 sprays every 4 hours as needed for 4 days, prevents delayed CINV in 71% of patients, compared with only 22% of patients in the placebo group. There was no between-group difference in the occurrence of acute CINV, which was low in both groups (96814). This study is limited due to its small size and non-standardized treatment regimens.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if medical cannabis is beneficial for cognitive function.\nA small observational study in adults suggests that using medical cannabis containing low amounts of THC (64-36 mg/week) and high amounts of CBD (202-114 mg/week) to treat various conditions for 12 months may be associated with modest improvement in some measures of executive function, but no changes in memory or cognitive performance, when compared to baseline (108681). However, this study may have been too short to identify effects on cognition. In addition, improvement of clinical symptoms (e.g., pain or sleep) may correlate with cognitive improvement; results may not apply to patients using cannabis for recreational reasons.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Oral cannabis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for management of long COVID-19 symptoms, its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA single-center clinical study in Thailand in adults with a prior laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection plus 1 long COVID-19 symptom (e.g., altered sense of smell/taste, cough, fatigue, headache) shows that taking a combination product containing cannabis, alpinia, black pepper, lime, and Tiliacora triandra daily for 7 days slightly improves patient-reported symptom severity, but not C-reactive protein levels, when compared with placebo (116204). The validity of these results is limited by poor methodology and a lack of clinical validation for the symptom severity assessment tool.\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral cannabis oil or smoked cigarettes containing cannabis flowers can improve Crohn disease symptoms.\nA meta-analysis of 4 clinical trials in patients with Crohn disease shows that taking cannabis oil or smoking cigarettes containing cannabis flowers for 8-10 weeks modestly increases clinical remission rates, based on factors including abdominal pain and frequency of soft/liquid stools, when compared with placebo. Quality of life is not improved (116451). Additionally, data in patients with Crohn disease suggest that cannabis use does not improve endoscopic findings, when compared with placebo (108678).\n\nOverall, the available studies are small and utilize heterogeneous dosing regimens. Doses used in clinical research include cannabis oil containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 4% and cannabidiol (CBD) 16%, titrated gradually to satisfactory response to a maximum of 20 drops (THC 40 mg) twice daily before meals for 8-10 weeks or smoking cigarettes containing cannabis flowers 0.5 grams standardized to THC 115 mg twice daily for 8 weeks (96387, 108678, 116451).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if non-inhaled cannabis is beneficial for depression.\nA review of five clinical studies in adults with cancer shows that non-inhaled medical cannabis does not reduce the severity of depression symptoms when compared with control (115355).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if inhaled cannabis vapor might reduce fibromyalgia pain.\nA small clinical study in female adults with fibromyalgia and chronic pain shows that a single vapor inhalation of cannabis containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) increases the pressure pain threshold. Inhaling cannabis containing THC 22.4 mg and less than 1 mg of CBD also reduces pain scores by 30% when compared with placebo. However, inhaling cannabis containing THC 13.4 mg and CBD 17.8 mg does not improve pain when compared with placebo. Additionally, no cannabis products affected electrical pain thresholds or spontaneous pain scores (101420).\n\nRecent clinical practice guidelines for the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for the management of chronic pain strongly recommend the use of cannabinoid-based medicines as adjunct treatment for improvement of chronic back, fibromyalgia, or other pain in patients with fibromyalgia and inadequate response to other treatments. These recommendations are based on low quality evidence suggesting that benefits exceed the risks of non-serious adverse effects. Initiating treatment with a low dose reduces the risk of adverse effects (110321).\nless\nGlaucoma. It is unclear if smoking cannabis affects glaucoma risk or severity.\nSmoking seems to reduce intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. However, the effect is short-term (1268). There is some evidence that cannabis can decrease blood flow to the optic nerve (1268). Decreased ocular blood flow has been associated with increased visual field loss in patients with glaucoma (92664). So far, it is not known if smoking cannabis can improve visual function (1268).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related wasting. It is unclear if oral or smoked cannabis might attenuate wasting in patients with HIV.\nA questionnaire-based study has found that up to 97% of patients with HIV who smoke or ingest cannabis to treat symptoms experience improvements in appetite (61753). However, it is unclear if there are specific beneficial effects on wasting and controlled clinical research is needed to confirm these results. Recent clinical practice guidelines for the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for the management of chronic pain strongly recommend the use of cannabinoid-based medicines for management of nausea, lack of appetite, and weight loss in patients with HIV also using antiretroviral therapies (110321).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral cannabis oil lowers blood pressure.\nA very small study in older adults with hypertension shows that taking cannabis oil containing 1% to 10% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 2% to 20% cannabidiol (CBD), for an average total daily dose of about 21 mg of each cannabinoid, seems to modestly reduce blood pressure when compared with baseline (104480). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group and the non-standardized formulations and dosing used.\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if inhaled cannabis reduces migraine severity.\nObservational research in adults with migraine found that self-reported cannabis use via inhalation (smoking, vaping, etc.) is associated with a subjective reduction in migraine symptom severity. However, females were more likely than males to report a worsening in severity after cannabis use. Additionally, cannabis users reported a reduced magnitude of effect over time and an increase in the cannabis dose used, suggesting the development of tolerance (101487). Recent clinical practice guidelines for the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for the management of chronic pain weakly recommend the use of cannabinoid-based medicines as adjunct treatment for management of chronic headaches, including migraines and inadequate response to other treatments. These recommendations are based on low quality evidence related to cannabis suggesting that benefits exceed the risks of non-serious adverse effects. Initiating treatment with a low dose reduces the risk of adverse effects. The administration route may be patient specific (110321).\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Although there is interest in using cannabis for OCD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cannabis for this condition.\nPain (chronic). It is unclear if most oral or inhaled cannabis products are beneficial for patients with chronic pain. Some medical non-inhaled cannabis products seem to be beneficial in patients with chronic pain due to various causes.\nA 2021 British Medical Journal clinical practice guideline states that the evidence weakly supports a trial of non-inhaled medical cannabis in conjunction with standard pain management in individuals with moderate to severe chronic pain and insufficient pain relief. The recommendation is based on research in studies using non-inhaled medical cannabis products containing delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) for 1-4 months showing modest improvements in pain, physical function, and sleep, but not emotional, role, or social functions, when compared with standard treatment alone (108676, 108698). Recent clinical practice guidelines for the use of cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for the management of chronic pain strongly recommend the use of cannabinoid-based medicines, especially THC-predominant formulations, alone and/or as adjunct treatment for improvement of anxiety, pain, and sleep, in individuals with chronic pain not responsive to, or intolerant of, non-pharmacologic treatment. This recommendation includes slowly introducing cannabinoid-based medicines for individuals experiencing unsatisfactory response from, using high doses of, or experiencing adverse effects related to, opioids. These guidelines also weakly recommend the adjunct use of cannabinoid-based medicines for improvement of depression, mobility, nausea, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with chronic pain, stating that the risk of non-serious adverse events outweighs the risk of adverse events associated with standard analgesics. These recommendations are based on studies investigating a variety of cannabinoid-based medicines, including oral or inhaled whole plant, extracts, and isolated cannabinoids. The use of non-inhaled products, and/or initiating treatment with a low dose and titrating as needed, reduces the risk of adverse effects (110321). Specific doses of THC and CBD, and not other oral or inhaled cannabis products, may be recommended for some outcomes (108698, 110321). For more information on the specific doses of THC and CBD, see the individual monographs on these cannabinoids.\n\nHowever, not all professional organizations agree. A Presidential Task Force from the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) does not endorse the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for pain relief due to the lack of high-quality evidence and significant gaps in scientific knowledge (115380).\n\nA meta-analysis of low- to moderate-quality clinical studies in adults with chronic non-cancer pain shows that using non-inhaled medical cannabis for 1-6 months improves pain, physical functioning, and sleep quality, but not role, social or emotional functioning, when compared with placebo. Additionally, a meta-analysis of other low- to moderate-quality clinical studies shows that there may be little to no difference between cannabis and opioids for improving pain, physical functioning, and sleep quality. However, opioids were associated with a higher odds of discontinuation due to adverse events (115045).\n\nThe effects of a specific inhaled cannabis product have also been investigated. A small clinical study in patients with chronic pain shows that a single inhalation of a cannabis extract containing THC 0.5 mg or 1 mg reduces pain for 150 minutes when compared with baseline. However, only the THC 1 mg dose reduces pain when compared with placebo (104481). Due to the single-dose nature of this study, the effects of continued administration of inhaled cannabis containing THC on chronic pain are unclear. Also, the effect of most oral or inhaled cannabis products in patients with chronic pain is unclear.\n\nThe placebo response in the available research is moderate to large and any additional benefit of cannabis-based products is small and possibly insignificant (110230).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if smoking cannabis or taking oral cannabis extract is beneficial for improving Parkinson disease symptoms.\nAn observational study in patients with Parkinson disease has found that smoking cannabis 0.5 grams during a single session improves most motor symptoms, including tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, by 30 minutes after smoking. Patient-reported pain and quality of sleep also improved (96813). Most preliminary clinical research included in a meta-analysis shows that cannabis, usually inhaled, improves specific symptoms such as pain, sleep problems, anxiety and rigidity (108685). However, a small clinical trial in patients with Parkinson disease shows that using a specific cannabis extract standardized to THC 2.5 mg and cannabidiol 0.8-1.8 mg per capsule (Cannador, Society for Clinical Research) twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve the severity of disease when compared with placebo. Dosing was escalated over the 4-week period reaching THC levels of 0.034 to 0.25 mg/kg daily (108342).\nless\nPostoperative pain. It is unclear if oral cannabis extract is beneficial for improving pain following endodontic treatment.\nA small clinical trial in patients undergoing endodontic treatment shows that taking a cannabidiol-rich cannabis extract does not reduce postoperative pain when measured for up to 7 days when compared with placebo. The extract, consisting of cannabidiol (CBD) 78.5% and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 3.7%, was placed under the tongue and held for 3 minutes before swallowing (116435).\nless\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear if smoking cannabis is beneficial for PTSD.\nA small clinical crossover study in veterans with PTSD shows that self-administration of smoked cannabis, titrated to a maximum dose of 1.8 grams daily for 3 weeks, improves PTSD symptoms when compared with baseline, but not when compared with placebo. Patients used cannabis flower that contained either delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 12%, cannabidiol (CBD) 11%, or a combination of THC 7.9% with CBD 8.1% (108675). The validity of this finding is limited due to unclear reporting.\nless\nPre-procedural anxiety. It is unclear if oral cannabis extract is beneficial for improving anxiety prior to endodontic treatment.\nA small clinical trial in patients undergoing endodontic treatment shows that taking a cannabidiol-rich cannabis extract does not reduce pre-procedural anxiety when compared with placebo. The extract, consisting of cannabidiol (CBD) 78.5% and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 3.7%, was placed under the tongue and held for 3 minutes before swallowing (116435).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear whether an oromucosal cannabis spray (Sativex) improves RA symptoms.\nA small clinical study in adults with RA shows that using a specific oromucosal cannabis spray (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals), containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2.7 mg and cannabidiol (CBD) 2.5 mg per actuation, daily for 5 weeks may help decrease morning pain and improve quality of sleep, but not joint stiffness or total pain intensity, when compared with placebo (61762).\nless\nSickle cell disease. It is unclear if vaporized cannabis is beneficial for reducing chronic pain associated with sickle cell disease.\nA small clinical study in patients with sickle cell disease and chronic pain shows that inhaling vaporized cannabis, containing 4.4% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 4.9% cannabidiol (CBD), 3 times daily for 5 days does not seem to reduce pain ratings or opioid use when compared with placebo cannabis containing no active cannabinoids (104479). This study is limited by its short duration and small sample size.\nless\nStress. It is unclear if cannabis is beneficial for reducing cancer-related stress.\nA review of two clinical studies in adults living with cancer shows that using medical cannabis does not reduce stress when compared with control (115355).\nless\nSubstance use disorder. It is unclear if cannabis use is associated with non-medical opioid use in adults receiving pharmacological treatment for opioid use disorder.\nA meta-analysis of 10 longitudinal studies in adults receiving methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone for opioid use disorder for an average of 10 months found that cannabis use is not associated with the risk of non-medical opioid use when compared with no cannabis use (115364).\nless\nTourette syndrome. Although there is interest in using cannabis for Tourette syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cannabis for this condition.\nUlcerative colitis. Small studies suggest that smoking cannabis flower may improve symptoms of ulcerative colitis; however, it is unclear if cannabis improves clinical response.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis shows that smoking a cannabis flower cigarette containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 80 mg twice daily for 8 weeks, in conjunction with standard therapy, improves Lichtiger disease activity index scores, abdominal pain, and number of bowel movements, but does not improve endoscopic disease activity or markers of inflammation, when compared with placebo. At a 1-year follow-up, all patients who received cannabis and achieved remission during the study retained long-term remission (108680).

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nCannabis formulations include capsules, oromucosal sprays, and cigarettes. Capsules and oromucosal sprays may be standardized to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) content. Some cigarettes have been standardized based on THC concentration (11167, 11168, 17371, 61739, 61762, 61800, 61820)(61833, 61846, 96387, 96814).\n\nA specific oral product containing cannabis extract (Cannador, Society for Clinical Research) is standardized to contain THC 2.5 mg and cannabidiol 0.8-1.8 mg per capsule (91919, 108342, 108685).\n\nNabiximols (Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals) (Sativex, Otsuka Pharmaceutical) is an oromucosal spray containing whole-plant extract of cannabis. The extract is standardized to contain THC 2.7 mg and CBD 2.5 mg per spray. Other constituents in the spray included ethanol, propylene glycol, peppermint oil flavoring, terpenoids, flavonoids, and minor amounts of other cannabinoids such as cannabinol, cannabichromene, and cannabigerol (61762, 91907, 96814).\n\nThe Cannabis sativa plant is classified as a phytoremediator, meaning that it readily absorbs contaminants from the soil. Due to this, cannabis products are at high risk for contamination with these compounds, including heavy metals and pesticides. Alarming concentrations of pesticides have been found in cannabinoid-containing products sold in the Netherlands, California, and Canada (102337).",

In vitro studies in kidney cell lines show that a 1-hour exposure to CBD and THC inhibits P-gp (61769, 104889). Cannabis may also alter the expression of P-gp, although this effect appears to vary based on duration of exposure. Some in vitro research in lymphoblastoid leukemia cell lines indicates that a 1-hour exposure to cannabinoids does not affect P-gp expression, while a prolonged 72-hour exposure decreases P-gp expression (61771).

            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nBIPOLAR DISORDER\nPopulation research has found that cannabis use is associated with a 3-fold increase in the risk of new onset of mania symptoms. Using cannabis also appears to worsen manic symptoms in patients already diagnosed with bipolar disorder (91912). Following cessation of cannabis use for at least 3 months, previous users had high rates of remission and recovery with outcomes related to work impairment and relationship status similar to those that had never used cannabis (96385).\nless\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES\nCannabis has the potential to cause tachycardia and transient hypertension, and may increase the risk of myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest in the general population (6, 61840, 61893, 100307, 111073, 111079, 113092).\nless\nCROSS-ALLERGENCITY\nCannabis may cause an allergic reaction in patients sensitive to certain other fruits and vegetables. In a case report, a developing allergy to cannabis in a regular cannabis user was associated with the development of allergies to peach and various food pollens. A specific allergen was identified in these products (96389). Cross-reactivity has also been found between parts of the cannabis plant and tomato, peach, mugwort, banana, and/or citrus (96389). Theoretically, using cannabis might increase the risk of allergies to various fruits or vegetables.\nless\nDEPRESSION\nThere is concern that cannabis use might worsen symptoms of depression. Observational research in patients with depression found that cannabis use is associated with worsened symptoms and suicidal ideation when compared with those that do not use cannabis (99575, 115357).\nless\nDIABETES\nThere is concern that cannabis can worsen glycemic control and complications of diabetes. Cannabis use has been associated with worsened glycemic control and increased glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with type 1 diabetes (100305, 100306). It has also been associated with a 2-fold increased risk for diabetic ketoacidosis in this population (99574). In patients with type 2 diabetes, cannabis use has been associated with an increased risk for diabetic nephropathy, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial occlusion (100307). Until more is known, advise patients with diabetes to be cautious using cannabis.\nless\nEPILEPSY\nThere is some concern that high doses of cannabis might precipitate seizures in patients with epilepsy. Although there has been some documentation of the protective effects of cannabis in epilepsy, high doses have been linked with exacerbations. There have been several case reports where high doses of cannabis with or without chronic use was associated with new onset or relapse of seizures (99580, 103793, 103794).\nless\nIMMUNODEFICIENCY\nDue to potential fungal contamination, cannabis use might cause fungal infections in patients who are severely immunocompromised. There is a case of mucormycosis which had spread to the renal allograft in a patient who smoked cannabis following a kidney transplant (111087).\nless\nLIVER DISEASE\nThere is concern that cannabis might increase progression of fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease. Observational research in people with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection found a non-significant trend of advanced fibrosis risk (99589). However, other observational research in patients with chronic liver diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), HCV infection, or coinfection with hepatitis C and HIV, did not find that cannabis use increases progression of hepatic fibrosis (99579). Until more is known, advise patients with chronic liver disease to be cautious using cannabis.\nless\nPERIOPERATIVE\nObservational research suggests that cannabis might increase the risk for various postoperative complications. A meta-analysis of observational research in adults with recent orthopedic surgeries suggests that patients with a history of chronic cannabis use have a higher risk for a wide range of complications (115363). A retrospective chart review in adults undergoing chest masculinization surgery suggests that prior cannabis use is associated with a greater risk of postoperative hematoma (115378). Additionally, cannabis has demonstrated CNS depressant effects in clinical research and could theoretically cause additive CNS depression when combined with anesthesia and other medications during and after surgical procedures (16815, 61934). Tell patients to discontinue cannabis at least 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures.\nless\nQTC PROLONGATION\nThere is some concern that cannabis may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and Torsades de pointes in patients at high risk for these conditions. In a 28-year-old female, a history of cannabis use was associated with prolonged QT interval and sudden cardiac arrest. It was hypothesized that a congenital ventricular septal defect (VSD) increased her risk (111079). In a 19-year-old female, vaporizing a highly concentrated THC wax using a butane torch and inhaling as a single breath (also known as dabbing), has been associated with the development of QTc prolongation-related ventricular fibrillation, followed by recurrent episodes of Torsades de pointes. This patient had certain genetic predispositions for this condition, such as a robust family history of Torsade de pointes and the presence of the KCNH2 mutation (108690).\nless\nRESPIRATORY DISEASES\nThere is concern that inhaled cannabis may worsen respiratory diseases. Observational research has found that long-term use of cannabis is associated with worsened lung function and respiratory conditions (6, 1395, 61806, 61814, 61901).\nless\nSCHIZOPHRENIA\nThere is concern that cannabis might worsen psychosis in schizophrenia. Population research has found that cannabis use is associated with about a 6% increased risk of psychosis in people with schizophrenia who are not at risk for psychosis. The risk appears to be even greater for those already at risk for psychosis, with a 24% increased risk of psychosis (92674). Other population research has found that using cannabis is also associated with an increased risk of psychosis in patients with a genetic risk for developing schizophrenia (92675).\nless\nSMOKING CESSATION\nCannabis use may reduce the success of smoking cessation attempts. Observational research in adults seeking smoking cessation treatment found that recreational cannabis use is associated with a lower cessation success rate after 6 months when compared with no cannabis use (101484).\nless\nSTROKE\nTheoretically, using cannabis may be linked with an increased risk of stroke recurrence. Epidemiological research has found that there are increased cases of stroke recurrence in patients who resumed cannabis use during follow-up from an initial stroke (91913).\nless\nSWALLOWING DYSFUNCTION\nOral cannabis oil may be aspirated in patients with swallowing dysfunction.

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nBased on emergency department surveillance data, the most common presenting symptoms of acute toxicity related to lone cannabis use include agitation, anxiety, chest pain, drowsiness, hallucinations, palpitations, psychosis, and vomiting. Headache, hypertension, and seizures are less common. Of patients presenting to the hospital with acute toxicity due to cannabis, death occurred in 0.1% (116437).\n\nOrally, edible cannabis products reported to contain 50 mg or more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) have been associated with cases of anxiety, psychosis, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmia (103796). In one case of acute cannabis toxicity in a 29-year-old male, due to accidental overdose related to cannabidiol gummies, presentation included altered mental status, aggression, lactic acidosis, tachycardia, and vomiting. A urine drug screen was positive for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and negative for other substances (116446).\n\nAccidental ingestion of cannabis-containing edibles has been associated with poisoning in children ages 12 years and younger (103793, 103794, 110237). Additionally, in one case, accidental ingestion of cannabis resin by a toddler resulted in death (116452).\n\nExcessive and prolonged cannabis use can lead to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), which is characterized by cyclic attacks of nausea and vomiting that is not alleviated by conventional antiemetics (99577, 99585, 115046, 115372, 115375). In rare cases, hypophosphatemia has also occurred (99577, 115375). In several cases, CHS has been linked to severe complications resulting in death (99585).\n\nA meta-analysis of 18 observational studies suggests that legalization and decriminalization of cannabis is associated with an approximately 3.5-fold increase in the relative risk of acute poisoning (113022).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with cannabis.\n\nVarious treatments for CHS have been proposed, although cessation of use is considered the only cure (115046). CHS symptoms are not alleviated by conventional antiemetic medicine (99585, 101423, 101424, 116447). However, acute CHS has been successfully managed with benzodiazepines (101424) and dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (115372) in case reports. Anecdotally, patients that have developed CHS use extremely hot baths to temporarily reduce symptoms (99585, 101423, 101424, 115372). Topical capsaicin, which is thought to mimic the physical sensation produced by hot baths, has also shown some benefit in small clinical studies (105193, 105201, 109021). The use of haloperidol has also been considered for refractory and severe nausea and vomiting in patients with CHS (115046).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCannabinoids in cannabis, such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), are absorbed orally or by inhalation (108344). Absorption of vaporized THC appears to be greater than smoked THC, although absorption from any type of inhalation ranges from 2% to 56% (101427, 101506). Maximum plasma concentrations of THC occur approximately 3-30 minutes after inhalation of smoke or vapor (101427, 108344). Orally, approximately 6% to 20% of THC is absorbed, with a peak plasma concentration occurring most commonly between 1-3 hours (101506, 108345, 111092). A small study in healthy adults shows that oral consumption of brownies containing 10-50 mg THC resulted in peak plasma concentrations of THC and 11-hydroxy-THC at between 1.5 and 2 hours (104496). Another small study in healthy adults shows that oral consumption of brownies containing THC 20 mg plus cannabidiol (CBD) 640 mg increases maximal plasma levels of THC by 1.8-fold, and the area under the curve by 2.5-fold, when compared to consuming brownies containing only THC 20 mg (111092).\n\nAnimal research suggests that oral CBD is poorly absorbed, with a bioavailability between 13% to 19%. This is likely due to a significant first-pass effect (89905, 106629).\n\nFollowing inhalation of cannabis, cannabigerol (CBG) is detectable in the plasma of some individuals within 30 minutes (111081).\nDistribution\nOral or inhaled cannabinoids such as THC, found in cannabis, are rapidly distributed throughout the body and have a high affinity for fat tissues (6, 61796). THC concentrations in the oral fluid seem to be affected by direct contact between cannabis and the oral cavity, and not by plasma levels of THC (104496). Cannabidiol and its metabolites are more than 94% protein bound (99613).\nMetabolism\nOral cannabinoids are metabolized by hepatic microsomal enzymes. The major metabolic route of cannabidiol (CBD), found in cannabis, was identified as hydroxylation and oxidation at C-7, followed by further hydroxylation in the pentyl and propenyl groups to give 1\"-, 2\"-, 3\"-, 4\"-, and 10-hydroxy derivatives of CBD-7-oic acid (61992). Metabolism of THC results in the production of 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) and 11-carboxy-THC (11-COOH-THC). These compounds undergo glucuronidation (108344, 111070).\nExcretion\nTHC, CBD, and their metabolites are excreted in feces and urine (61874, 99613, 108344), although CBD is primarily excreted in the feces (99613). The elimination half-life of the cannabis constituent CBD has been estimated to be 1-5 days (61781, 61924). The metabolites appear in the urine for ten days or more after a single exposure and for several weeks after chronic exposure (6, 61821, 61916). Clinical research suggests that the half-lives of inhaled and intravenous CBD are 31 hours and 24 hours, respectively (61924).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of cannabis are the flower and leaf. Cannabis contains more than 100 cannabinoids, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (13, 62008, 96389). The THC concentration is highest in the flowers and leaves and lowest in the stems, roots, and seeds (6). THC can interact with cell-wall lipids or affect prostaglandin biosynthesis (18).\nAging effects\nObservational research suggests that current cannabis smoking is associated with an acceleration in epigenetic age when compared with former or never smoking. Additionally, for every year of cannabis smoking there was an approximately 0.12-year increase in DNA methylation GrimAge (115369).\nAnalgesic effects\nVarious clinical trials have shown that cannabis has analgesic effects. These effects have been attributed to the cannabinoid constituents of cannabis (61741, 61721). Evidence from animal research shows that cannabinoids in cannabis, particularly delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), reduce pain by functioning as type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) agonists (61698, 61808). However, some research in humans suggests that THC does not have analgesic effects. In healthy adults, a single dose of intravenous THC 0.01-0.03 mg/kg caused cognitive and physiological effects, but did not reduce the severity of experimentally-induced acute pain (104495).\n\nSome research also suggests that certain cannabinoids might reduce the analgesic effects of other cannabinoids. One clinical study of inhaled vaporized cannabis suggests that the inhalation of a product containing THC and cannabidiol (CBD) in combination antagonizes the analgesic effects that occur when THC is used alone (101420).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLaboratory research suggests that anti-inflammatory effects of the cannabinoids in cannabis are related to the cannabinoid 2 receptor. Inflammatory cytokine levels are reduced. However, in patients with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis, cannabis had no effect on C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (96387, 108678, 108680). Observational research has found that recent cannabis use is not associated with inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP, fibrinogen, or interleukin-6. However, a history of 11 to over 100 occasions of cannabis use was associated with modestly reduced fibrinogen levels when compared to never using cannabis (103014).\nAnticancer effects\nResearch on the effect of cannabinoid constituents of cannabis on cancer is conflicting. The effect of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, and other cytokines suggests it might promote the growth of cancer cells (10239, 10240). However, some in vitro research suggests that cannabinoids inhibit human breast cancer cell proliferation. Other in vitro research shows that cannabidiol (CBD) induces apoptosis in leukemia cells, possibly by functioning as a cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) antagonist and increasing the expression of NAD(P)H oxidases (61735, 61784). When THC is infused directly into the tumor mass, it seems to produce tumor eradication or improvements in survival in animals with experimentally-induced malignant gliomas (a type of brain tumor). THC induces tumor cell apoptosis via CB1 and CB2 receptors expressed on the glioma cells (5887). CBD also appears to induce apoptosis of glioma cells in vitro and tumor regression in vivo, possibly by triggering caspase activation (61733, 61789). In vitro research also shows that CBD inhibits the migration of glioma cells. The exact mechanism is unclear (61751).\nAntiemetic effects\nIn human and animal research, cannabinoid constituents of cannabis, particularly delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), have been shown to have antiemetic properties by inhibiting neurotransmitter release by specific cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) (61706, 61721, 61771). Cannabinoids are at least as effective as prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, thiethylperazine, and other conventional antiemetic drugs (6606, 10241). However, in animal research, cannabidiol (CBD) was ineffective (61706).\nAntiestrogenic effects\nIn laboratory research, a cannabis smoke condensate was found to have an antiestrogenic effect in human breast cancer cells. However, the three major constituent cannabinoids - delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabinol - did not have this effect (61767).\nAntioxidant effects\nLaboratory research suggests that the cannabis constituents delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) have antioxidant effects. Laboratory optical and electrochemical methods suggest that THC and CBD have similar antioxidant activity to ascorbic acid, resveratrol, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) (103019). Additional in vitro research shows that THC and CBD protect rat cortical neuron cultures from oxidative damage from toxic levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate (103020).\nAntiplatelet effects\nBoth cannabis constituents delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) have been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro, with THC exhibiting a more potent effect than CBD (61689, 61917).\nAntipsychotic effects\nIn human research, cannabis constituents delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) had opposing effects in psychosis. In healthy human volunteers, anxiety and psychotic-like symptoms were observed to occur with THC; however, these effects were significantly reduced by CBD (61742, 61780, 61969). Neuroimaging (61732) and animal research (61949) have reported similar findings for CBD. However, not all research agrees. A small study in healthy humans shows that a single dose of CBD does not attenuate anxiety and euphoria from THC, which theoretically might contribute to psychotic symptoms (104497).\nCardiovascular effects\nAcute use of cannabis increases heart rate. This is thought to be due to cannabis-induced vasodilation causing a reflex-type tachycardia (96378). Some experts think that cannabis use increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, based on findings in case reports. Potential mechanisms of action include a change in the electrophysiological properties of the heart muscle and ischemia of the circulation in the heart (96378). Increased catecholamine release and hyperstimulation of vagal tone might explain cases of ventricular tachycardia (96378). Acute coronary reactions might be related to a cannabis-induced transient coronary vasospasm and/or to increases in carboxyhemoglobin levels with reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood (96378, 111074). Increased blood pressure and heart rate decreases the angina threshold by almost 50% (96378). Oral and inhaled cannabis use is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction, but not arterial stiffness, possibly due to decreased production of nitric oxide by endothelial cells (116442). In laboratory research, cannabis has also been shown to have procoagulant and prothrombotic effects (96378). Laboratory research also suggests that the cannabinoid delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has direct toxic effects on the blood vessel wall increasing the risk of arteritis and causing peripheral vasoconstriction (96378). In vitro research has found higher expressions of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 in atherosclerotic lesions from a cannabis user when compared with plaque histology from a non-user; however, the implications of this finding are unclear (108688).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nTwo types of cannabinoid receptors have been identified in animals: CB1, which is found predominantly in the CNS and is thought to be responsible for the psychoactive effects, and CB2 which is found in high levels on immune system cells including leukocytes, and to a lesser extent in the brain (5887, 5888, 5889, 108688). The cannabis cannabinoid delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) seems to suppress the immune function by its action at the CB2 receptors. It increases the activity of interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-4, and other cytokines that inhibit immune function and decreases interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-12, cytokines responsible for stimulating immune function. This effect might reduce resistance to infections (10239, 10240).\nNeurological/CNS effects\nCannabinoids in cannabis, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), act on the central nervous system (CNS) (13). THC can act via cannabinoid receptors in neural tissues or opiate receptors in the forebrain, leading to indirect inhibition of the emetic center in the medulla oblongata (13, 2619).\n\nTwo types of cannabinoid receptors have been identified in animals: CB1, which is found predominantly in the CNS and is thought to be responsible for the psychoactive effects, and CB2 which is found in high levels on immune system cells including leukocytes, and to a lesser extent in the brain (5887, 5888, 5889, 108688). THC is a partial CB1 receptor agonist and has limited CB2 agonist activity (5889). In an animal model of multiple sclerosis, THC has been reported to reduce tremor and spasticity, possibly through its activity at CB1 receptors in the brain (5889).\nOcular effects\nThere is concern that regular cannabis use might alter vision. Observational research has found that regular cannabis users have a delay in signal transmission in retinal ganglion cells when compared to patients that do not use cannabis (99586)."

    "Canola Oil": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Canola oil is a type of oil used in food. It is produced from the canola plant, which is an edible variety of rapeseed. Unlike rapeseed oil, which contains the toxin erucic acid at levels of 30% to 50% of fatty acids, canola oil contains erucic acid at levels of less than 2% (98590).\n\nOleic acid is one of the main unsaturated fatty acids in canola oil. In October 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that due to its unsaturated fat content, there was credible evidence to support a qualified health claim that consuming canola oil in place of other fats and oils higher in saturated fat may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (95736). In November 2018, the FDA determined that there was also credible evidence to support a similar qualified health claim for foods with high oleic acid content (at least 70% per serving of oil), which includes some canola oils (98563).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Canola oil with an erucic acid content of no more than 2% of the component fatty acids is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in foods (98543). However, like many other edible oils, canola oil contains some saturated fatty acids and should be used in moderation.\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of canola oil when used orally in medicinal amounts.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Canola oil with an erucic acid content of no more than 2% of the component fatty acids is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in foods. Also, canola oil is generally recognized as safe when used in infant formulas at levels of up to 31% of the total fat blend (98543). In Europe, infant formulas are allowed a maximum of 1% erucic acid as fatty acids, with no restriction on canola oil (98590). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of canola oil in medicinal amounts.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods (98543). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of using canola oil in medicinal amounts during pregnancy or lactation. Consuming canola oil, a source of alpha-linolenic acid, increases levels of this fatty acid in breast milk (98582). While alpha-linolenic acid is likely safe during pregnancy and lactation when used in amounts typically found in food (7141, 7142, 7145), it is unknown if it is safe in amounts exceeding those typically found in foods; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nCanola oil is well tolerated when used in foods (98543). No adverse effects have been reported.",
            "Effectiveness": "POSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). One preliminary clinical study shows that including canola oil, high oleic acid canola oil, or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched canola oil 60 grams per 3000 kcal of energy daily as part of a fixed composition diet for 4 weeks can reduce Framingham 10-year coronary heart disease risk scores by 8.2%, 19%, and 6.8% compared to baseline in patients with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (26466). Other preliminary research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that eating a canola oil-enriched bread supplement as part of a low glycemic load diet as an adjunct to oral hypoglycemic agents for 3 months reduces the Framingham risk score for CVD by 0.6% compared to eating a wheat fiber bread as part of a whole-grain diet (98569). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows for a qualified health claim that replacing dietary fats and oils higher in saturated fat with canola oil, which contains less saturated fat, may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. To achieve this benefit, canola oil or other oleic-acid containing oils should not increase total daily energy intake. The suggested daily dietary intake is about 20 grams (1.5 tbsp) of canola oil in place of other fats and oils (98563).\nHypercholesterolemia. Most research shows that consuming canola oil as part of the diet in place of other dietary fats may improve cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nA meta-analysis of 27 clinical trials shows that taking canola oil as part of a canola oil-enriched diet, or as an additional 12-50 grams daily, reduces levels of total cholesterol by 7.4 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 6.4 mg/dL compared to control (101768). Another meta-analysis of 42 trials shows that canola oil significantly reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, LDL to HDL cholesterol ratio, total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio, apolipoprotein B, and Apo B to Apo A1 ratio. In most cases, the reductions in these values seen with canola oil are greater than those seen with olive oil, sunflower oil, and saturated fats. The maximum benefit is seen when about 15% of the total daily caloric intake from other oils is replaced with canola oil (110416). Other clinical research in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome shows that taking canola oil, 25 grams daily for 10 weeks reduces non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol, and also the ratios of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides to HDL cholesterol, when compared with sunflower oil (110412). In a meta-analysis of 13 trials comparing canola and olive oils, canola oil improved total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and the LDL to HDL cholesterol ratio when compared with olive oil (110417).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with at least one cardiovascular risk factor shows that including canola oil, high oleic acid canola oil, or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched canola oil as part of a fixed composition diet for 4 weeks can reduce total cholesterol by 7.4% to 9.4% and LDL cholesterol by 7.0% to 12.5% when compared with baseline (26466). Other research in patients with hypercholesteremia shows that using a high oleic acid canola oil (Canola Harvest HiLow, Richardson Oilseed Limited), with or without flaxseed oil, as the main source of dietary fat for 4 weeks reduces LDL cholesterol by 7.4% and 15.1%, respectively, when compared with a blend of fats found in a regular Western diet (21698, 98589).\n\nPreliminary clinical research also shows that consumption of a canola oil-based cheese for 4 weeks reduces levels of total and LDL cholesterol in adults with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia, when compared with a milk-fat based cheese (98577).\n\nSome studies in postmenopausal females, and those with polycystic ovarian syndrome, show that taking canola oil, 25-30 grams daily for 6-12 weeks decreases serum triglyceride levels (110412, 110414), but there is also conflicting data showing no significant effect on triglycerides (98572, 110417). Canola oil also does not have a significant effect on HDL cholesterol levels (110414, 110417).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nObesity. Although taking canola oil may modestly reduce body weight in obese patients by about 0.3 kg when compared with taking control fats, the benefit is probably not clinically significant. Taking canola oil does not appear to improve body composition or reduce body mass index (BMI) (98564, 98568, 101767).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDiabetes. Preliminary clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that eating a canola oil-enriched bread supplement as part of a low glycemic load diet as an adjunct to oral hypoglycemic agents for 3 months reduces HbA1c by 0.47% compared with a reduction of 0.31% following intake of a wheat fiber bread as part of a whole-grain diet. Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were also reduced in those taking canola oil (98569). Other preliminary research in mainly postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes shows that taking canola oil 30 grams daily for 8 weeks reduces levels of LDL cholesterol by a small amount, as well as levels of C-reactive protein, when compared to a sunflower oil control. However, it is less effective than rice bran oil for LDL cholesterol reduction, and there is no benefit to glycemic measures (98584, 101766).\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia. A small clinical trial shows that using canola oil in place of all visible fat, at levels of 14-27 grams daily as part of a low-fat diet, for 13 weeks reduces levels of LDL cholesterol by 12.7% compared with baseline in children 6 years and up with familiar hypercholesterolemia. However, canola oil is no more effective than the same amount of sunflower oil (98586).\nHypertension. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched canola oil for 4 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by 3.3% and diastolic blood pressure by 4.1% compared to baseline in men and women with central obesity and at least one other cardiovascular disease risk factor. However, conventional canola oil and high oleic acid canola oil did not reduce blood pressure, suggesting that the benefit may relate to DHA content (26466).\nMetabolic syndrome. Preliminary clinical research shows that using canola oil (Virgino, Kankaisten Öljykasvit Ltd) 35 mL daily instead of butter 37.5 grams daily for 6-8 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 11% in males with metabolic syndrome. There were no differences in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, glucose, or HbA1c (98573).\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Preliminary clinical research in men with NAFLD shows that cooking with canola oil (Hudson Canola Oil, Dalmia Continental Pvt. Ltd.) no more than 20 grams daily along with therapeutic lifestyle modifications for 6 months reduces the grading of fatty liver based on ultrasound imaging to normal liver grading in about 77% of patients compared with 10% of those cooking with soybean/safflower oil while following therapeutic lifestyle modifications (98570).\nMore evidence is needed to rate canola oil for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nCoronary heart disease (CHD): The FDA has determined that there is credible evidence to support a qualified health claim that consuming edible oils such as canola oil, which contain low levels of saturated fat and high levels of oleic acid, in place of other fats and oils higher in saturated fat may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. The suggested daily intake is about 20 grams (1.5 tbsp) of canola oil daily in place of other fats and oils (98563). In clinical research, foods providing canola oil 31 grams per 2000 kcal or 60 grams per 3000 kcal of energy, as part of a controlled diet for 1-3 months, has been used (26466, 98569).\n\nDiabetes: Food providing canola oil 30-31 grams per 2000 kcal energy daily as part of a balanced or low glycemic load diet for 2-3 months has been used (98569, 98584, 101766).\n\nHypercholesterolemia: Canola oil 60 grams per 3000 kcal daily for 4 weeks has been used (26466). Replacing fat with canola oil in prepared food for 3 weeks has been used (98572). A high oleic acid canola oil (Canola Harvest HiLow; Richardson Oilseed Limited), alone or as a 1:1 flaxseed oil blend, providing 70% of the dietary fat for 4 weeks has been used (21698). Canola oil-based cheese providing canola oil 11 grams daily for 4 weeks has been used (98577).\n\nHypertension: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched canola oil containing 63% oleic acid and 6% DHA has been used in place of other dietary fats at a dose of 60 grams of canola oil per 3000 kcal of energy daily for 4 weeks (26466).\n\nMetabolic syndrome: Canola oil (Virgino, Kankaisten Öljykasvit Ltd) 35 mL daily in place of butter 37.5 grams daily for 6-8 weeks has been used (98573).\n\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Dietary canola oil (Hudson Canola Oil, Dalmia Continental Pvt. Ltd.) no more than 20 grams daily along with therapeutic lifestyle modifications for 6 months has been used (98570).\nChildren\nOral:\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia: Using canola oil in place of all visible fat, at levels of 14-27 grams daily as part of a low-fat diet, for 13 weeks has been used in children age 6 years and up (98586).\nStandardization & Formulation\nEdible canola oil contains low levels of saturated fatty acids (about 7%), and significant amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Most often canola oil is standardized to oleic acid content. Typically, canola oil contains >60% oleic acid. Canola oil described as being \"high oleic\" canola oil usually contains >70% oleic acid (95735).",

            "Interactions with Supplements": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with canola oil.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCanola oil contains alpha-linolenic acid. Following consumption of canola oil, levels of alpha-linolenic acid increase in the blood (98567, 98568, 98572, 98585). Canola oil enriched in oleic acid or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), increases levels of these respective fatty acids in the blood (98567). Consuming canola oil containing alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, and coenzyme Q10, increases levels of these compounds in the blood (98588).\nMetabolism\nConsumption of canola oil results in increases of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the blood and erythrocytes by a small amount following metabolism of alpha-linolenic acid to EPA (98568, 98585).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCanola oil is a type of vegetable oil derived from the canola plant, which is a variety of rapeseed. Unlike rapeseed oil, which contains the toxin erucic acid at levels of 30% to 50% of fatty acids, canola oil contains erucic acid at levels of less than 2%, and usually approximately 0.5% (98590). Edible canola oil typically contains low levels of saturated fatty acids (about 7%), and significant amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (95735). The main unsaturated fatty acids in canola oil are oleic acid, linoleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid (98572). Some cold-pressed or unprocessed canola oils contain phenolic compounds like sinapine, sinapic acid, and vinylsyringol, as well as coenzyme Q10 and plant sterols (98573, 98588).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nConventional canola oil and canola oil enriched in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduce some measures of inflammation in human research (98587).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, using canola oil in place of regular dietary oils for 9 weeks results in increased fasting blood glucose levels, but favorable changes in insulin sensitivity, fasting serum insulin levels, and beta cell function (106035). In females with polycystic ovary syndrome, taking canola oil 25 grams daily for 10 weeks decreases insulin resistance, as measured by the HOMA-IR (homeostasis model evaluation for insulin resistance index) (110412).\nCardiometabolic effects\nIn an analysis of data from over 520,000 people aged 50-71 years, followed for 16 years, total mortality was higher with butter and margarine consumption, when compared with canola or olive oil consumption, and decreased when canola or olive oil was substituted for butter and margarine in the diet. The hazard ratios for cardiometabolic mortality for each one tablespoon increase in intake were 1.08 for butter, 1.06 for margarine, 0.99 for corn oil, 0.98 for canola oil, and 0.96 for olive oil (110413). Research in patients with, or at risk for, the metabolic syndrome shows that using canola oil in the diet in place of regular oils does not improve flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, indicating no improvement in endothelial function or cardiovascular disease risk (110415).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn human research, canola oil intake reduces levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (98573, 98579). Also, taking high oleic acid canola oil seems to prevent the binding of LDL particles to the arterial wall (98567). However, in adults with type 2 diabetes, replacing regular dietary oils with canola oil for 9 weeks does not change cardiovascular disease risk scores (108353).\nHepatic effects\nUsing canola oil in place of regular dietary oils for 9 weeks is associated with an increase in serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (106035, 108349), although the clinical significance is unknown. In females with polycystic ovary syndrome, taking canola oil 25 grams daily for 10 weeks reduces the fatty liver grade (110412).\nWeight loss effects\nIn human research, canola oil increases plasma levels of leptin slightly in men and decreases levels in women. The clinical significance of these changes is unclear; however, changes in leptin values play a role in weight, as well as glycemic response (98578). Clinical studies in healthy adults and in those with type 2 diabetes receiving oral antidiabetic agents show that replacement of regular dietary oils with canola oil for 9 weeks, or replacement of 30 grams of regular dietary fats with 30 grams canola oil daily for 6 weeks, is associated with minor reductions in waist and hip circumference and central adiposity, but without significant effects on body weight, body mass index, total body fat, or visceral fat (106036, 106037, 110414)."

Oral tanning preparations containing canthaxanthin have been found to be readily available to consumers in the United States through mail order and tanning salons despite warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (5635, 5638). A combination product containing beta-carotene and canthaxanthin (Phenoro: 10 mg beta-carotene and 15 mg canthaxanthin) is used in Europe for treatment of photosensitivities associated with EPP (5637).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCanthaxanthin is a carotenoid that is found naturally and produced synthetically (5637). It is not a precursor of vitamin A, has no vitamin A activity, is highly lipid soluble (5635), and accumulates in fatty tissue (5632).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro, canthaxanthin inhibits prostaglandin PGE2 formation (39698).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro and animal studies suggest canthaxanthin may inhibit the growth and transformation of tumor cells (5642, 5647, 5648) by inducing the gap junctional communication between cells (5649). In preliminary clinical research, canthaxanthin with beta-carotene prevented the onset of second primary tumors in the lung, colon, urinary bladder, and head and neck (39691) and increased disease-free intervals in patients following radical removal of the primary tumors in organs such as the lung, breast, colon, and head and neck areas (39710, 39700). However, antiproliferative effects were lacking in some in vitro and human studies (39683, 39688, 39687). Some of canthaxanthin's protective activities may come from its degradation products, including 4-oxo-retinoic acid, which enhances both GJC and expression of connexin43 mRNA (5649). Canthaxanthin may protect by directly inhibiting cell growth (39742), affecting retinoid signaling pathway products (39684), or being largely independent of conversion to retinoic acid, as is the case for beta-carotene (39727). Cell types (keratinocytes vs. fibroblasts) may differ in how they process canthaxanthin (39731).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, phenoxy radicals effectively oxidized canthaxanthin (39736); canthaxanthin was found to effectively quench singlet molecular oxygen (32696), and canthaxanthin inhibited low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation in human monocyte-macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner (39735). Ingesting canthaxanthin and beta-carotene together inhibited the appearance of canthaxanthin in plasma, chylomicrons, and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) subfractions, but not in LDL (39739).\nDermatologic effects\nOral canthaxanthin is thought to color the skin by accumulating in the epidermis and subcutaneous fat tissue (5635). Evidence suggests canthaxanthin and other carotenoids protect against photosensitization due to their antioxidant activity against reactive oxygen species by deactivating electronically excited molecules or acting as chain-breaking agents (1326, 5649). However, some evidence in vitro shows that canthaxanthin does not reduce oxidative damage in human skin cells (32665).\nOcular effects\nCanthaxanthin, even at relatively low concentrations, has the ability to modify retinal lipid properties and membrane organization (39695). Limited and subtle differences in vision have been identified between participants ingesting canthaxanthin and those not (39704, 5639, 39707, 39732, 39709, 5636, 5640, 39708, 1326, 34641, 39692). After isolating a specific xanthophyll-binding protein or proteins, binding between canthaxanthin and a solubilized retinal xanthophyll-binding protein or proteins was found to be lacking; therefore, the role of canthaxanthin in protecting against age-related macular degeneration is unclear (39686)."

These improvements were significant when compared with the placebo group. Patients taking caper fruit extract also showed improvements in triglyceride levels but not cholesterol levels (96124). However, preliminary clinical research in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome shows that taking caper fruit extract in a solution of grape vinegar and lactulose for 3 months does not reduce fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, or plasma lipid levels.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of capers.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of capers are the unopened flower bud, aerial parts, fruit, and root. Capers contain alkaloids, lipids, flavonoids such as quercetin and rutin, tocopherols, carotenoids, and glucosinolates (12738, 12739, 39754, 96124, 101894, 101895). Components of the seeds include palmitic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and sterols (110692). An extract of the aerial parts contains capparine A and B, flazine, guanosine, capparisine A and C, cappariloside, galocatechin, 4-hydroxy-1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde, kaempferol and derivatives, thevetiaflavone, sakuranetin, quercetin and derivatives, rutin, chrysoeriol, p-coumaroyl quinic acid, and eriodictyol-7-O-rutinoside (110693, 110696).\nAnalgesic effects\nResearch in an animal model of neuropathic pain shows that a caper extract reduces nociceptive pain, reduces inflammation in the spinal cord, and improves antioxidant status when compared with control. Levels of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1-beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha are reduced, and levels of antioxidant thiols, including glutathione, are increased (110696).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nCapers are traditionally used for rheumatism, arthritis, and gout. In vitro research in chondrocytes shows that caper bud extracts have anti-inflammatory effects, resulting in reduced activity of inflammatory cytokines. Caper bud extracts, containing the antioxidant polyphenolic flavonoids, also protect against chondrodegeneration by protecting against the production of oxidative and other inflammatory mediators (39747).\nAntidiabetes effects\nCaper fruits are traditionally used for hyperglycemia and diabetes. Some preliminary clinical research shows that caper fruit extract can lower blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes (96124). Animal research suggests that this effect is independent of insulin secretion. In animals, caper extract decreases fasting blood glucose, glucose intolerance, and oxidative stress by reducing hepatic lipid peroxidation and increasing antioxidant enzyme levels. It also improves dyslipidemia, increases weight gain, and increases serum insulin levels. Caper fruit extract might inhibit gluconeogenesis in the liver, or increase uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues. In vitro, caper flower extracts inhibit the enzymes alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, while increasing activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase (12736, 101894, 110692).\nAntimicrobial effects\nCaper extracts have shown antibacterial effects against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and antifungal activity against Candida albicans (12741).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary research suggests that capers might have antioxidant effects (12738, 39746, 101894). The antioxidant effects of capers are thought to play a role in any anti-inflammatory effects (39747).\nAntiviral effects\nCapers are traditionally used for various types of infections. Laboratory research has shown that caper bud extract interferes with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This is possibly due to the production of inflammatory cytokines by the mononuclear cells (39752).\nCognitive effects\nIn a rat model of Alzheimer-type cognitive impairment, an extract of the aerial parts of capers reduces the time for rats to escape from a water maze and reduces the distance they travel, suggesting an improvement in their memory of the maze. The extract seems to reduce inflammation in the brain associated with cognitive impairment, reducing levels of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclo-oxygenase 2, interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-6, nitric oxide, and prostaglandin-E2, and increasing levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (110693).\nHepatoprotective effects\nA constituent of the aqueous extract of capers, p-methoxy benzoic acid, seems to have hepatoprotective effects in animal and laboratory research (12740). In a rat model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a caper fruit extract taken orally attenuates liver steatosis, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis, reduces liver weight, and improves liver function tests and plasma lipid levels. Suggested mechanisms are down-regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and upregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase expression (110694).\nSedative effects\nIn mice, extracts of the aerial parts of capers augment pentobarbital-induced sleep, with reduced latency time and lengthened sleeping time. These effects are reversed by flumazenil (110695)."

In addition to mitochondrial beta-oxidation, caprylic acid can be metabolized in peroxisomes and microsomes to form medium-chain dicarboxylic acids, (omega-1)-hydroxyacids, octanoylglucuronide, and octanoylcarnitine (26151, 26152). These processes are the primary forms of caprylic acid metabolism in patients with acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (26151).\nExcretion\nIn general, carbon dioxide formed during the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of caprylic acid is excreted in the breath (25100).

Another case of coronary vasospasm and acute myocardial infarction has been reported for a healthy 29-year-old male; the event was attributed to the use of a topical capsicum-containing patch that the patient had been applying to the middle of the back for 6 days (40658). Two cases of arterial hypertensive crisis have been reported for individuals who ingested a large amount of peppers and chili peppers the day before. One of the patients also had an acute myocardial infarction, and the other had high levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (40569, 40606).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, capsicum or its constituent capsaicin may cause urticaria and skin wheals in rare cases (96457, 105203).\n\nTopically, capsicum can cause a prickling sensation, itching, pain, burning, edema, stinging, irritation, rash, and erythema. About 1 in 10 patients who use capsaicin topically discontinue treatment because of adverse effects. These effects seem to occur more often with topical formulations containing higher concentrations of capsaicin, the active constituent of capsicum. Side effects tend to diminish with continued use (12401, 15260, 15261, 40358, 40439, 40483, 40547, 40676, 40682, 40719)(40784, 40847, 92979, 92983, 92984, 96453, 105193, 105197, 105202, 111514). In one case, application of a capsaicin 8% patch (Qutenza) for 60 minutes caused a second-degree burn, characterized by burning, erythema, severe pain, and blistering at the administration site. The burn was treated with topical corticosteroids, but 9 months later neuropathic pain persisted, resulting in limited mobility. It is unclear whether the mobility sequalae were caused by topical capsaicin or the patient's pre-existing neurological disorders (111514). Skin contact with fresh capsicum fruit can also cause irritation or contact dermatitis (12408).\n\nIntranasally, capsaicin can cause nasal burning and pain in most patients. It also often causes lacrimation, sneezing, and excessive nasal secretion; however, these side effects appear to diminish with repeat applications (14323, 14329, 14358). In some cases, the burning sensation disappears after 5-8 applications (14351, 14358). In some cases, patients are pretreated with intranasal lidocaine to decrease the pain of intranasal capsaicin treatment. However, even with lidocaine pretreatment, patients seem to experience significant pain (14324).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, capsicum can cause upper abdominal discomfort, including irritation, fullness, dyspepsia, gas, bloating, nausea, epigastric pain and burning, anal burning, diarrhea, mild constipation, and belching (12403, 12410, 40338, 40427, 40456, 40503, 40560, 40584, 40605, 40665)(40718, 40725, 40745, 40808, 40828, 96456, 96457, 105194, 105196). There is a case report of a 3-year-old female who experienced a burning and swollen mouth and lips after touching the arm of a parent that had been treated with a capsaicin patch and then placing the fingers in the mouth (105199). Excessive amounts of capsaicin can lead to gastroenteritis and hepatic necrosis (12404). In a case report, a 40-year-old male with diabetes consumed white wine daily and chewed cayenne which was thought to result in black teeth stains and loss of enamel (40809). Some preliminary research links ingestion of capsaicin with stomach and gallbladder cancer; however the link may be due to contamination of capsaicin products with carcinogens (40771).\n\nTopically, capsaicin can cause diarrhea and vomiting (105202).\nless\nImmunologic\nIn a case report, a 34-year-old female had anaphylaxis involving difficulty breathing and stupor and also urticaria after consuming a red bell pepper, which is in the capsicum genus. The causal chemical was theorized to be 1,3-beta-glucanase (92978). In another case report, a 33-year-old female experienced angioedema, difficulty breathing and swallowing, and urticaria after ingesting raw green and red peppers (92982).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, capsicum can cause sweating and flushing of the head and neck, lacrimation, headache, faintness, and rhinorrhea (7005, 12410, 105196, 105203). Topically, applying capsaicin can cause headache (96450, 105202). Injection of capsaicin into the intermetatarsal space has also been associated with headache (96454).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nTopically, capsicum can be extremely irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes. Capsicum oleoresin, an oily extract in pepper self-defense sprays, causes intense eye pain. It can also cause erythema, blepharospasm, tearing, shortness of breath, and blurred vision. In rare cases, corneal abrasions have occurred (12408, 12409, 40345, 40348, 40383, 40720, 40857).\n\nInhalation of capsicum can cause eye irritation, and allergic alveolitis (5885). In a case report, a 38-year-old female had acute anterior uveitis that developed about 12 hours after using a specific patch (Isola Capsicum N Plus) that contained capsaicin 1.5 mg per patch and methyl salicylate 132 mg per patch for neck pain. The uveitis was controlled with topical steroids and did not recur (92977).\nless\nOncologic\nPopulation research suggests that moderate to high intake of capsaicin, the active constituent of capsicum, is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, while low intake is associated with a decreased risk. It is not clear from the study what amount of capsaicin is considered high versus low intake (92988). Additionally, some research suggests that any link may be due to contamination of capsaicin products with carcinogens (40771).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, difficulty breathing was reported in a clinical trial (105196).\n\nTopically, nasopharyngitis related to the use of a cream containing capsaicin has been reported (105202).\n\nInhalation of capsicum and exposure to capsicum oleoresin spray can cause cough, dyspnea, pain in the nasal passages, sneezing, rhinitis, and nasal congestion (5885, 15016, 40522, 40546, 40647). In rare cases, inhalation of the capsicum oleoresin or pepper spray has caused cyanosis, apnea, respiratory arrest and death in people. Death was caused by asphyxiation probably due to acute laryngeal edema and bronchoconstriction from inhalation of the capsicum oleoresin spray (40546, 40672, 40837, 40879).\n\nIn a case report, a 47-year-old female who was exposed to capsaicin gas for more than 20 minutes experienced acute cough, shortness of breath, short-term chest pain, wheezing, and difficulty breathing for months afterwards (92980). In rare cases, exposure to capsicum oleoresin spray resulted in apnea, pulmonary injury, cyanosis, and even respiratory arrest (40383, 40546).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nDiabetic neuropathy. Applying a specific prescription patch containing capsaicin 8% or a specific cream containing capsaicin 0.075% can reduce pain in diabetic neuropathy.\nClinical research has evaluated the use of a specific patch (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.) containing capsaicin 8%, which is approved as a prescription medication by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The research in this population shows that a single application of the patch on the painful parts of the feet for 30-90 minutes following pretreatment with topical anesthetics reduces pain for up to 12 weeks when compared with placebo (40719, 96453). Patients using the patch experience reduced sleep interference and an average 28% reduction in pain, compared with a 21% reduction with placebo. Additionally, 50% of patients receiving the patch experience pain relief within 19 days, compared to 72 days for those receiving placebo (96453). A meta-analysis of the available clinical research for diabetic peripheral neuropathy found that one-time application of this patch is equally effective to duloxetine 20-120 mg daily, pregabalin 75-600 mg daily, and gabapentin 300-3600 mg daily in producing a 30% or 50% pain reduction. The dose of oral medication used in the evaluated studies did not impact the comparative efficacy of the capsaicin patch (96450).\n\nOther clinical research shows that applying cream containing capsaicin 0.075% four times daily for 8 weeks reduces pain intensity when compared with placebo in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (40547, 40592, 40607). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that applying cream containing capsaicin 0.075% reduces pain similarly to 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster (40674). Topical cream containing capsaicin 0.075% (Zostrix-HP, Link Medical Products Pty Ltd.) is FDA-approved as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication for this indication (272).\n\nHowever, applying a capsaicin lotion less frequently or with a lower concentration of capsaicin does not seem to be beneficial. A small clinical study in patients with diabetic neuropathy shows that applying a specific lotion (Capsika-75 lotion, Bangkok Drug Company) containing capsaicin 0.075% three times daily for 8 weeks improves pain to a similar degree as a placebo lotion (102277). This study was limited by a high dropout rate, high placebo effect, and poor adherence to therapy. Furthermore, cream or gel (such as Capsika-25 gel, Bangkok Drug Company) containing lower amounts of capsaicin do not appear to be effective for reducing diabetic peripheral neuropathy pain (92984).\nless\nPain (chronic). Topical cream containing capsaicin can reduce chronic pain associated with various conditions. Topical capsaicin is FDA-approved for this use.\nSeveral clinical studies show that topically applying cream containing capsaicin, the active capsicum constituent, 0.05% to 0.075% temporarily relieves chronic pain from rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, back pain, jaw pain, psoriasis, and neuropathic conditions (12401, 17701). Capsaicin, used in topical preparations, is FDA-approved for these uses (272). It can take up to 14 days for the full analgesic effect. For neuropathic pain, the number needed to treat using capsaicin 0.075% for eight weeks is 5.7 (12401). For musculoskeletal pain, for every 8.1 patients treated with capsaicin 0.025%, 1 patient would achieve at least a 50% reduction in pain (12401). Also, applying capsaicin 0.05% (Finalgon CPD Warmecreme) three times daily for 21 days seems to cause a 49% reduction in chronic soft tissue pain when compared with placebo (17701).\nless\nPostherpetic neuralgia. Applying a specific prescription patch containing capsaicin can reduce postherpetic neuralgia pain, especially in patients with the lowest pain scores.\nClinical research has evaluated the use of a specific patch (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.) containing capsaicin 8%, which is approved as a prescription medication by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. Research in this population shows that applying a single patch for 60-90 minutes reduces average pain over 24 hours by 27% to 37% for up to 12 weeks, compared to only 4.4% to 26% in patients in the control group (40659, 40679, 40686, 40691, 40719, 40728, 40800, 92985, 96451, 96452). The number needed to treat to achieve at least a 30% or 50% reduction in pain intensity is 10 and 12, respectively; the number needed to treat to achieve an additional beneficial outcome over placebo at 8 weeks and 12 weeks is 9 and 7, respectively (40800, 96451). The pain reduction with this patch has an onset of a few days after treatment and the effect lasts for about 5 months (92986). However, some evidence shows that the reduction in pain is only significant for patients who have had postherpetic neuralgia for at least 6 months (40686). Additionally, the reduction in pain and duration of response appears to be greatest for patients with lower pain scores and low sensitivity to light touch at baseline, as well as patients not using concomitant systemic neuropathic pain medications, whereas patients with high pain scores, high sensitivity to touch, or those using systemic neuropathic pain medications experience the smallest and least sustained reduction in pain (40728, 96458). Also, other evidence suggests that this patch may be less effective at relieving postherpetic neuralgia when compared with 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster (40688).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBack pain. Topical capsicum or capsaicin seems to be beneficial for reducing back pain.\nA meta-analysis of generally low-quality clinical research, as well as individual studies, show that applying a capsicum-containing plaster providing 11 mg of capsaicin per plaster or 22 mcg of capsaicin per square centimeter of plaster to the back once daily in the morning for 4-8 hours reduces low back pain when compared with placebo (15259, 15260, 15261). Applying capsaicin 0.05% (Finalgon CPD Warmecreme) three times daily for 21 days seems to cause a 58% reduction in low back pain when compared with placebo (17701). Also, in a mixed group of patients with acute back or neck pain, a large clinical trial shows that four topical applications with a gel containing capsaicin 0.075% with diclofenac 2% every 12 hours modestly reduces pain on motion when compared with diclofenac alone or placebo. The number of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain from baseline was modestly higher. Capsaicin 0.075% was similarly effective alone and when combined with diclofenac 2% (105202). However, only about half of the patients in this study had back pain.\nless\nCluster headache. Intranasal capsaicin seems to be beneficial for preventing cluster headaches. Its effect in the treatment of cluster headache is unclear.\nSome clinical research shows that using the capsicum constituent capsaicin intranasally reduces the frequency of episodic or chronic cluster headache attacks (14323, 14351, 14352, 14358). Capsaicin suspensions of 0.1 mL of a 10 mM suspension, providing 300 mcg/day of capsaicin, has been applied to the ipsilateral nostril. Applications are continued once daily until a burning sensation is no longer experienced (14351, 14358). Intranasal application of capsaicin 0.025% (Zostrix, Rodlen Laboratories) might also decrease symptom severity during an acute cluster headache attack. Clinical research shows that daily treatment for 7 days decreases symptom severity over the following week (14353). Ipsilateral, or same side, nostril application of capsaicin appears to be more effective than contralateral application (14351). Due to severe pain associated with intranasal capsaicin administration, pretreatment with intranasal local anesthetic is usually used.\nless\nNonallergic rhinitis. Intranasal capsaicin in a dose of at least 0.1 mM seems to improve symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis. It is unclear if lower doses of capsaicin are beneficial.\nClinical research shows that repeated intranasal in-clinic treatments with capsaicin, the active capsicum constituent, or with capsicum oleoresin, over a period of one to three days, can significantly decrease symptoms of non-allergic, non-infectious perennial rhinitis symptoms (14328, 14357, 15016, 40595, 105204, 105205). A decrease of symptoms has been observed for up to 6-9 months following these treatments (14328, 14357). The following doses have been used: capsaicin 0.15 mg per dose for up to 7 doses over a 14-day period (14328), capsaicin 0.0033 mol once weekly for 5 weeks (14357), capsaicin 15 mcg/0.1 mL applied three times daily for 3 days (15016), and capsaicin 1-4 mcg per puff, applied 3 times in each nostril daily for 3 days (40595). Due to severe pain associated with intranasal capsaicin administration, pretreatment with intranasal local anesthetic is usually used.\n\nPersonal use of an intranasal spray with a lower dose of capsaicin might also be effective. Clinical research shows that two 0.4 mL puffs with an intranasal spray in each nostril daily for 4 weeks providing capsaicin 0.01 mM, but not 0.001 mM, is more effective than placebo for reducing symptoms of idiopathic rhinitis. This benefit is maintained for an additional 8 weeks. This protocol was at least as effective as receiving five repeated hourly intranasal spray treatments in hospital with capsaicin 0.1 mM (105204).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) conditionally recommends topical capsaicin for knee osteoarthritis, but not for hip or hand osteoarthritis.\nA meta-analysis of 4 preliminary clinical trials shows that using topical capsaicin 0.025% four times daily has modest benefit for osteoarthritis when compared with placebo. Using capsaicin 0.0125% doesn't seem to be effective (102408). The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) conditionally recommends topical capsaicin for knee osteoarthritis. However, it does not recommend its use for hip osteoarthritis due to the depth of the joint beneath the skin surface, nor for hand osteoarthritis, due to the risk for contamination of the eye (102114).\nless\nPain (acute). Topical capsicum seems to be beneficial for reducing acute pain due to trauma.\nClinical research in patients with trauma-related acute pain shows that topical application with a gel (Sanli Gel) containing capsaicin 0.05% three times daily for 3 days reduces pain by at least 50% in 87% of patients, compared with 63% of those using a piroxicam gel 0.5% (Felden). There was also a significantly greater number of patients with a final pain score of 4 or less. In the capsaicin group, only 12% of patients did not achieve either of these endpoints, compared with 31% in the group receiving piroxicam (105197).\nless\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Applying topical capsicum to acupoints seems to be beneficial for preventing PONV.\nClinical research shows that applying a capsicum-containing plaster to acupoints on the hand and forearm 30 minutes prior to anesthesia and leaving in place for 6-8 hours daily for up to 3 days after surgery reduces the incidence of PONV by about 29% to 36% when compared to control (40405, 40483, 40610). Plasters used in these studies included Sinsin PAS (Sinsin Pharm Co.), which is standardized to contain capsicum 345.8 mg and capsicum tincture 34.58 mg per sheet (40405, 40610); and Johnson's Perforated Capsicum Plaster (Johnson & Johnson Ltd.), which is standardized to contain capsicum oleoresin 1% w/w (40483).\nless\nPostoperative pain. Applying topical capsicum-containing plaster to acupoints seems to be beneficial for reducing postoperative pain. It is unclear if a capsicum patch or capsaicin instillation prior to wound closure is beneficial for reducing postoperative pain.\nSome clinical research shows that applying a capsicum-containing plaster to acupoints on the hands or near the knees of adults or children 30 minutes prior to anesthesia, and leaving in place for 6-8 hours daily for up to 3 days after surgery, reduces the amount of rescue analgesics needed by 29% to 39% within the first 24 hours and by 16% to 19% within the first 48 hours when compared to control (40405, 40483, 40520, 40524, 40610). The capsicum-containing plaster used in these studies (Sinsin PAS, Sinsin Pharm Co.) is standardized to contain capsicum 345.8 mg and capsicum tincture 34.58 mg per sheet (40520, 40610).\n\nOther preliminary clinical research shows that applying a single patch containing the capsicum constituent capsaicin 8% (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.) for 30-60 minutes leads to an improvement in overall health status and an average 22% reduction in pain that lasts up to 12 weeks in patients with postoperative and posttraumatic neuropathic pain. Patches were applied to various parts of the body, including the legs, torso, feet, hands, arms, head, and neck, and the reduction in pain continued with the use of a second and third patch application. The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group (96452).\n\nOther clinical evidence suggests that instilling capsaicin 15 mg during surgery immediately prior to wound closure reduces the need for pain medication for up to 2 weeks postoperatively when compared with placebo (40741).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if intranasal capsaicin is beneficial for preventing allergic rhinitis symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that intranasal treatment with cotton wads soaked in the active capsicum constituent capsaicin 30 mcM, applied for 15 minutes and repeated over two days, reduces the severity of experimentally-induced allergic rhinitis. The severity of symptoms seems to be reduced for up to 2 months after treatment (14324). However, contradictory research shows that patients with allergic rhinitis caused by house dust mites do not have significantly improved symptoms after using a capsaicin solution providing 0.15 mg/dose for up to 7 doses over a 14-day period when compared with placebo (14360).\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Although there is interest in using oral capsicum for ALS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of capsicum for this condition.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral capsaicin is beneficial for improving athletic performance; the available research is limited to small, conflicting studies.\nSeveral small clinical studies in physically active young adults show that taking capsaicin might improve some measures of athletic performance, but results are mixed overall (99409, 99410, 102276, 105191, 105198, 105200). A meta-analysis of these and several other small clinical studies shows that taking the capsicum constituents capsaicin or capsiate 45 minutes before exercise improves measures of muscular endurance but does not improve aerobic endurance when compared with placebo. Doses of the capsicum constituents ranged from 1.2-24 mg, with most studies assessing a single 12 mg dose (111515). The included studies have a number of methodological problems that limit the validity of the findings, such as a small sample size, short study duration, and insufficient blinding. Also, most of the study participants were male.\n\nOther small clinical studies not included in the meta-analysis also show conflicting results. One small clinical study in untrained young adults undergoing resistance training shows that taking capsiate, a capsaicin analog, 6 mg orally twice daily for 6 weeks improves upper body, but not lower body, weightlifting performance when compared with placebo (109024). However, another small clinical trial in experienced male athletes shows that taking cayenne (GNC Nature's Fingerprint Cayenne Herbal Supplement) 3 grams, providing capsaicin 25.8 mg, daily for 7 days does not improve sprint time, rate of perceived exertion, or muscle soreness over three days when compared with placebo (105206).\n\nCapsicum has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical study in untrained males shows that taking a supplement containing capsicum extract 66.7 mg, caffeine 400 mg, black pepper extract 10 mg, and niacin 40 mg prior to exercising does not improve strength, time to exhaustion, or maximal oxygen consumption when compared with placebo (37873).\nless\nBurning mouth syndrome. It is unclear if applying topical capsaicin in the mouth is beneficial for burning mouth syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical studies show that using 15 mL of a mouth rinse containing the active capsicum constituent capsaicin 0.02% for 30 seconds daily for 7-21 days modestly decreases burning discomfort when compared to baseline in patients with burning mouth syndrome (92991, 105195). Other preliminary clinical research shows that applying 0.5 mL of a gel containing capsaicin 0.01% or 0.025% to the tongue three times daily for 14 days modestly reduces pain when compared to baseline in patients with burning mouth syndrome. The gel is spread with a cotton swab, and no food or drink is consumed for 30 minutes after application (96456). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group, the small number of patients, and occasionally unclear statistical comparisons.\nless\nCancer. It is unclear if eating more chili is beneficial for preventing mortality due to cancer.\nPopulation research has found that consuming chili more than four times weekly is not associated with a reduced odds of cancer mortality (105208). Also, other population research has found that any consumption of hot red chili peppers is not associated with a reduced odds of mortality related to cancer (105210).\nless\nCannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). Preliminary clinical research suggests that topical capsaicin might be beneficial for reducing symptoms of CHS.\nOne small clinical study in adults presenting to an emergency department (ED) with CHS shows that applying 5 grams of a cream containing capsaicin 0.1% to the abdomen modestly reduces nausea severity at 60 minutes, but not 30 minutes, when compared with a placebo cream. Nausea was completely resolved in 29% of patients, compared with 0% of those using the placebo cream. However, there was no difference in vomiting at 30 or 120 minutes (105193). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference in some of these outcomes. A meta-analysis of two small, low-quality studies involving the topical use of capsaicin on the abdomen, chest, and possibly back, shows that the mean time to resolution of symptoms was 326 minutes and the mean length of stay in the emergency department was 379 minutes. However, it is unclear how these times compare to the use of placebo or standard antiemetics. This study also conducted a systematic review of the available literature, which indicates that the creams most commonly used in research provide 0.025% to 0.1% capsaicin (105201).\n\nTwo low-quality, retrospective reviews also suggest that capsaicin cream may be beneficial for CHS. A retrospective review of patients in the ED with CHS has found that applying capsaicin cream 0.025% is associated with a 39% shorter time to discharge when compared with control. Patients treated with capsaicin also required fewer additional rescue treatments when compared with control (109021). Another retrospective review of patients in the ED with CHS also suggests that capsaicin cream 0.025% modestly reduces abdominal pain when compared with baseline. However, 47% and 28% of patients, respectively, received additional antiemetics or an opioid after the use of the cream (105345).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if eating more chili is beneficial for preventing mortality due to CVD.\nPopulation research has found that consuming chili more than four times weekly is associated with a 34% reduced odds of CVD mortality when compared with never or rarely consuming chili, as well as 44% and 61% reduced odds of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular death, respectively (105208). Other population research has found that consumption of hot red chili peppers is not associated with a reduced odds of mortality related to CVD when compared with not eating hot red chili peppers (105210).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral capsaicin is beneficial for gestational diabetes. Details: Preliminary clinical research shows that taking chili powder containing capsaicin 5 mg daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces total cholesterol levels and reduces postprandial blood glucose levels by an average of 36 mg/dL and postprandial insulin levels by an average of 14 IU/L in patients with gestational diabetes. Compared to a placebo group, these changes are significant. However, capsaicin intake does not alter fasting plasma glucose or insulin levels (96457).\nDry skin. It is unclear if oral capsicum is beneficial for dry skin.\nPreliminary clinical research in adult females with low skin moisture shows that taking paprika oil extract 400 mg, standardized to include 9 mg of xanthophyll, orally daily for 4 weeks improves skin moisture and viscoelasticity scores, but not the number of wrinkles, when compared with control (109026).\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral capsicum is beneficial for reducing lipid levels.\nA meta-analysis of three or four mainly small clinical trials in healthy adults shows that taking capsicum does not improve levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with no treatment or placebo. However, there was a small to moderate effect on levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Freshly chopped chili or fermented red pepper were studied for 4 and 12 weeks, respectively (105194). It is unclear if capsicum can lower lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia or hyperlipidemia.\nless\nDyspepsia. It is unclear if oral capsicum is beneficial for dyspepsia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking red pepper powder 2.5 grams daily in three divided doses for 5 weeks reduces symptoms of functional dyspepsia when compared with placebo. However, in some patients, there seems to be a worsening of symptoms prior to any improvement (12410).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral capsicum is beneficial for fibromyalgia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying cream containing the active capsicum constituent capsaicin 0.025% four times daily to tender points for 4 weeks reduces localized tenderness in patients with fibromyalgia (7038). Other preliminary clinical research shows that applying capsaicin 0.075% cream (Sensedol) three times daily to tender points for 6 weeks in addition to standard therapy increases the pain threshold when compared with standard therapy in patients with severe fibromyalgia (92979). However, capsaicin does not appear to reduce overall pain or improve physical function in patients with fibromyalgia (7038, 92979). Also, the long-term effects of capsaicin on fibromyalgia-related pain are unclear.\nless\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Although there is interest in using oral capsicum for GERD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of capsicum for this condition.\nHIV/AIDS-related peripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if topical capsaicin is beneficial for this condition.\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of Qutenza (NeurogesX Inc.), which contains the active constituent of capsicum, capsaicin 8%. Although some research shows it reduces pain in patients with HIV and peripheral neuropathy (22395), other research shows no significant benefit (40746). A meta-analysis of results from both of these studies shows that applying a single capsaicin 8% patch for 30-90 minutes reduces pain intensity by at least 30% in about 30% more patients when compared to control (40800). Additional meta-analyses of the results from these two studies suggests that pain reduction with capsaicin begins a few days after treatment and lasts for about 5 months, with a number needed to treat of 11 to achieve at least a 30% reduction in pain intensity (92986, 96451). Reduction in pain and duration of response appears to be greatest for females with lower pain scores at baseline, whereas males with high pain scores at baseline experience the smallest and least sustained reduction in pain (96458).\n\nSome research has also evaluated topical capsaicin 0.075%. One small clinical study shows that applying this cream does not relieve symptoms of HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy when compared with placebo (3891).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral capsicum is beneficial for lowering blood pressure.\nTwo meta-analyses of small clinical trials show that taking capsicum as freshly chopped chili, fermented red pepper, red pepper capsules, or capsinoid capsules orally daily for 4-12 weeks does not reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with control. However, most subjects included in these clinical trials did not have hypertension (105194, 109025).\nless\nIntermetatarsal neuroma. It is unclear if injecting capsaicin into the third intermetatarsal space is beneficial for intermetatarsal neuroma.\nClinical research in adults with intermetatarsal neuroma shows that a single injection of capsaicin 0.1 mg into the third intermetatarsal space 5 minutes after administration of 2 mL of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine leads to a modest reduction in pain at weeks 1 and 4, but not weeks 2 and 3, when compared with placebo. Capsaicin also reduces the extent to which pain interferes with walking and mood, but not with work, sleep, relationships, or general activity (96454).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral capsicum is beneficial for IBS.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking ground guajillo chili 1 gram, containing capsaicin 0.112%, with each meal for 7 days does not reduce symptoms of IBS (12403). A small clinical study shows that taking chili (Nguan Soon Co., Ltd.) 2.1 grams, providing 2.5 mg capsaicin, daily before meals for 6 weeks does not improve abdominal burning, fecal urgency, or abdominal pain or bloating after a spicy meal. However, there was a modest reduction in abdominal burning after a spicy meal (105207). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference in some of these outcomes.\nless\nLaryngitis. Although there is interest in gargling with capsicum for laryngitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of capsicum for this condition.\nMotion sickness. Although there is interest in oral capsicum for motion sickness, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of capsicum for this condition.\nMyofascial pain syndrome. It is unclear if topical capsaicin is beneficial for myofascial pain syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific capsaicin cream (Dipental Cream, Dalim BioTech) containing capsaicin 0.25 mg/gram along with a ketoprofen 30 mg patch (KetotopVRPlaster, Pacific Pharma) to the trapezius does not reduce pain when compared with a ketoprofen patch alone in patients with myofascial pain (92983).\nless\nNeck pain. It is unclear if topical capsaicin is beneficial for neck pain.\nIn a group of patients with acute back or neck pain, a large clinical trial shows that four topical applications with a gel containing capsaicin 0.075% with diclofenac 2% every 12 hours modestly reduces pain on motion when compared with diclofenac alone or placebo. The number of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain from baseline was modestly higher. Capsaicin 0.075% was similarly effective alone or when combined with diclofenac 2% (105202). However, only about half of the patients in this study had neck pain.\nless\nNeuropathic pain. It is unclear if topical capsicum is beneficial for neuropathic pain.\nA very small study in adults with neuropathic pain secondary to spinal cord injury shows that applying a patch containing the capsicum constituent capsaicin 8% for 60 minutes daily to the affected area for 12 weeks reduces pain at weeks 2 and 4 and improves mobility, but not quality of life, for up to 12 weeks when compared with placebo (111517). The validity of these findings is limited by insufficient blinding and the small sample size.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral capsicum is beneficial for obesity.\nA meta-analysis of 3-5 small clinical trials shows that taking capsicum does not reduce body weight, body fat, or body mass index (BMI) in individuals with a BMI of at least 25 kg/m2 when compared with placebo or no treatment. Freshly chopped chili, fermented red pepper, or capsicum constituents were studied for 4-12 weeks (105194). In one clinical trial included in the analysis, taking capsinoids 3 mg twice daily 30 minutes prior to eating for 12 weeks reduced abdominal fat by about 1%, but did not significantly reduce body weight, when compared with placebo (40599). In overweight individuals, one small clinical trial shows that taking a specific chili extract 200 mg, formulated with fenugreek dietary fiber for sustained release (Capsifen, Akay Natural Ingredients), providing capsaicinoids 4 mg daily for 28 days reduces body weight and BMI by about 2% when compared with placebo. There was no effect on blood pressure (105196).\n\nCapsicum has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients, with some evidence of benefit. One study evaluated a combination product (Prograde Metabolism) containing capsicum extract (Capsimax, OmniActive Health Technologies), raspberry ketone (Razberi K, Integrity Nutraceuticals), caffeine, garlic root extract, ginger root extract, bitter orange fruit (Advantra Z, Nutratech Inc), L-theanine, and black pepper fruit extract (Biperine, Sabinsa Corporation) twice daily for 8 weeks (40802).\nless\nOverall mortality. Eating chili may be beneficial for preventing mortality. It is unclear if taking capsicum supplements is beneficial for preventing overall mortality.\nPopulation research has found that consuming chili is associated with a reduced risk of overall mortality. In one study, eating chili more than four times weekly was associated with a 23% reduced odds of overall mortality when compared with never or rarely consuming chili (105208). Other population research has found that any consumption of hot red chili peppers is associated with a 13% reduced odds of mortality when compared with not eating these peppers (105210). Also, eating spicy foods at least once each week, consisting mainly of fresh chili pepper, dried chili pepper, chili sauce, or chili oil, was associated with at least a 10% reduced risk of death when compared with eating these foods less than once a week (105211).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. It is unclear if oral capsicum is beneficial for peptic ulcers.\nPopulation research has found that eating capsicum fruit (chili) an average of 24 times per month is associated with a reduced likelihood of having an ulcer when compared with eating chili an average of 8 times per month. This applies to chili in the form of chili powder, chili sauce, curry powder, and other chili-containing foods (12053). However, clinical research shows that consuming chili peppers 1 gram three times daily for 4 weeks does not improve duodenal ulcer healing when compared to control (40828).\nless\nPeripheral neuropathy. Preliminary clinical research suggests that topical capsaicin might be beneficial for reducing peripheral neuropathy pain.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying patches containing the capsicum constituent capsaicin 8% (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.) reduces pain in people with non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy (96452, 111516). Up to four patches, applied to different painful areas, are used at one time and are left in place for 30 minutes on the feet, or 60 minutes on other parts of the body such as the legs, torso, hands, arms, head, or neck (96452). After an interval of at least 90 days, treatment can be repeated, with new patches applied for 30-60 minutes (99407). There is an average 27% reduction in pain when compared to baseline, lasting up to 12 weeks (96452). Another similar study reported a decrease of 1 point, on a 10-point pain scale, in the typical daily pain intensity (99407). The validity of these findings is limited by methodological problems, including the lack of control groups. Further research shows that using a single application of up to four capsaicin 8% patches for 30-60 minutes, or taking pregabalin orally, 150-600 mg in 2-3 divided doses daily for 8 weeks, reduces the intensity and area of dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA, pain evoked by light brushing of the skin) in people with non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Complete resolution of DMA occurred in 24% of people using the patches, and 12% of those taking pregabalin (99408). The validity of these findings is limited by methodological problems, including a lack of blinding.\nless\nPrurigo nodularis. It is unclear if topical capsaicin is beneficial for prurigo nodularis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a cream containing the active capsicum constituent, capsaicin 0.025% to 0.3%, 4-6 times daily improves burning sensations, erythema, pruritus, and healing of skin lesions over a period of 2 weeks to 33 months when compared to baseline. Symptoms may return after discontinuation of therapy (10650).\nless\nSinonasal polyposis. It is unclear if intranasal capsaicin is beneficial for sinonasal polyposis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with severe sinonasal polyposis shows that intranasal application of 0.5 mL of a 30 mmol/L capsaicin solution to each nostril for 3 days, followed by 0.5 mL of a 100 mmol/L capsaicin solution for 2 days, can cause significant subjective improvement in symptoms as well as objective improvement in nose/sinus air volume and endoscopy scores; however, capsaicin does not seem to significantly affect eosinophil cationic protein levels (14359).\nless\nSwallowing dysfunction. Preliminary research shows that oral capsaicin might be beneficial for improving swallowing ability.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that elderly patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia due to swallowing dysfunction have improved swallowing reflexes after dissolving a lozenge containing capsaicin 1.5 mcg in the mouth before each meal when compared with using a placebo lozenge (13100). Preliminary clinical research also shows that capsaicin may be beneficial in patients with swallowing dysfunction due to stroke (102278, 105192). One study shows that taking 1 mL of nectar containing capsaicin 150 mcM/L with each meal daily for 3 weeks, in addition to thermal tactile stimulation, improves eating and swallowing when compared with using thermal tactile stimulation and placebo nectar (102278). Another study shows that 20 minutes of stimulation with an ice swab containing capsaicin 0.15 mM before lunch and dinner daily for three weeks modestly improves the ability to swallow water when compared with ice stimulation alone. After treatment, approximately 70% of those using the capsaicin ice were able to drink the water without choking, compared with only 33% in those using ice alone (105192).\n\nCapsaicin solution has also been administered by nebulizer. A clinical study in patients with swallowing dysfunction secondary to hemorrhagic stroke shows that inhaling capsaicin solution twice daily for one week reduces the incidence of post-swallow residue and pulmonary infection and increases number of coughs in response to capsaicin compared with placebo. However, treatment with nebulized capsaicin does not reduce the number of patients with swallow or cough reflexes compared with control (111518).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate capsicum for these uses.",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with capsicum.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nTaking capsicum 5 grams results in a maximum concentration of capsaicin of 2.47 ng/mL at about 47 minutes after ingestion (40614). Topically, capsaicin achieves the greatest absorption when mixed with isopropyl alcohol compared to mineral oil and propylene glycol vehicles (40469). Topical administration of capsaicin patch 640 mcg/cm2 results in 1.86 ng/mL of capsaicin in the plasma 60 minutes after application and ~3.7 ng/mL after 90 minutes (40628). After injection of capsaicin 0.1 mg into the intermetatarsal space, a peak concentration of 278 pg/mL is reached 1 hour after administration (96454).\nMetabolism\nIn vitro evidence suggests that capsaicinoids, which are components of dried chili peppers, are metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) enzymes (40417, 40478, 40478, 40771).\nExcretion\nCapsicum 5 grams taken by mouth had an elimination half-life of approximately 25 minutes (40614). Capsaicin, the active ingredient in capsicum, mixed with mineral oil, propylene glycol, or isopropyl alcohol and applied topically had an elimination half-life of 24 hours (40469). Topical administration of capsaicin patch 640 mcg/cm2 had an average elimination half-life of 1.64 hours (40628).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of capsicum is the fruit. Capsicum contains capsaicinoids, the most common of which is capsaicin (40669, 40360). Other examples are dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin, and homodihydrocapsaicin (105191). Capsaicin and other capsaicinoids are what makes capsicum taste hot. Naturally-occurring capsaicin exists only in the trans-stereoisomer form. However, the synthetic cis-isomer, known as zucapsaicin or civamide, also appears to have pharmacologic activity (14323). Some non-pungent capsiconinoids have also been identified, including capsiate, dihydrocapsiate, and nordihydrocapsiate (40627, 105191, 105194). Other constituents of capsicum include 3-hydroxypyridine (40559), N-hydroxycinnamic acid amides of serotonin (e.g., feruloylserotonin and p-coumaroylserotonin) (40493), flavonoids (40428), saponins (40394, 40398, 40504, 40844), and carotenoids (40449, 40451, 40457, 40591, 40644, 40486, 105203).\nAnalgesic effects\nCapsaicin, the active constituent of capsicum, is used for various disorders involving chronic pain such as arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, headaches, fibromyalgia and more. When used topically, capsaicin binds to peptidergic vasoactive nociceptors, a subclass of afferent nociceptors in the skin. This is felt as itching, pricking, or burning (7007, 12401, 12404, 12410, 40853, 96456, 111516).\n\nCapsaicin also causes cutaneous vasodilation. Observational research suggests that the magnitude of pain reduction after application of topical capsaicin correlates with the degree of neurogenic vasodilation. Researchers theorize that capsaicin accelerates the regeneration of peptidergic nociceptors (111516). Another possible mechanism for these effects is thought to be the result of selective stimulation of afferent C fibers, which act as thermoreceptors and nociceptors, release of substance P, a sensory neurotransmitter that mediates pain, reversible retraction of nerve fiber terminals, and temporary loss of membrane potential. This is followed by a refractory period with reduced sensitivity. After repeated applications, persistent desensitization occurs, possibly the result of substance P depletion. Pain relief may also be caused by degeneration of epidermal nerve fibers (7007, 12401, 12404, 12410, 40853, 96456). In animal models, capsaicin seems to alleviate pain by desensitizing the vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1) at the peripheral nerve endings (40422).\n\nWhen applied intranasally, capsaicin is also thought to decrease intranasal and central blood vessel neurotransmitters, cause vasodilation, and induce histamine or serotonin release (14323, 17701, 40696, 40774). In animal models, intranasal capsaicin also seems to deplete nerve fibers that are immunoreactive to the neuropeptides substance P or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (14352).\nAnti-emesis effects\nCannabinoid use is thought to lead to desensitization of TRPV1 receptors, which can cause intractable emesis. There is interest in using capsaicin to reduce these desensitization effects in patients with a condition called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (105201).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCapsicum appears to have acute inflammatory effects and anti-inflammatory effects after prolonged use. Anti-inflammatory effects of capsicum can contribute to its therapeutic effects for various conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, cluster headache, and fibromyalgia. Capsaicin, the active ingredient in capsicum, appears to suppress inflammation and itching induced by histamine and bradykinin (40873). Capsaicin seems to deplete the neuropeptides at their site of action (40839).This can help to prevent cutaneous allergic reactions (40452, 40810, 40814). However, other research suggests that after topical application of capsaicin to capsaicin-sensitive areas such as psoriatic lesions result in histamine release and subsequent increased blood flow and inflammation of the area (40327).\nAntibacterial effects\nSome evidence shows capsicum extract has antibacterial properties (12402, 40326, 40864). Laboratory research shows that capsaicin inhibits the growth of Helicobacter pylori (40526), Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium tetani, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes (12402, 40815). Additionally, some animal research shows that consuming capsaicin reduces bifidobacteria and staphylococci in the intestinal flora (40466).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is conflicting animal and laboratory research regarding the effects of capsaicin, the active constituent of capsicum, on cancer development. Some preliminary research suggests that capsaicin has antineoplastic effects. Capsaicin has been shown to inhibit proliferation, inhibit growth factor signaling pathways, induce apoptosis, and inhibit certain kinases and nuclear factors that signal cancer cells to multiply (40381, 40402, 40403, 40464, 40495, 40657, 40690, 40732, 40771, 40880). Another theory is that capsaicin has anticancer effects due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity (11139).\n\nCapsaicin is thought to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system to active metabolites. Whether these substances can cause cancer or protect against cancer by altering carcinogen metabolism is an area of active research (12404, 40771). Other preliminary research in animals shows that long-term capsaicin cream use increases occurrence of skin cancer (40715).\nAntidiabetic effects\nMeta-analyses of controlled trials in adults show that taking capsaicin 2-135 mg or red pepper 11.9 grams orally daily for 1 day to 12 weeks does not lower blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), or insulin levels when compared with placebo or no intervention. However, the validity of these meta-analyses is limited by the inclusion of healthy patients and other subjects without diabetes (109022, 109023). Individual preliminary studies in healthy patients have reported conflicting effects of capsicum on blood glucose and insulin levels when compared with control (40453, 40614). Preliminary clinical research in adults with gestational diabetes shows that ingestion of capsaicin 5 mg daily for 4 weeks lowers postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels, but not fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, when compared with placebo (96457).\n\nAnimal research in diabetic rats and healthy dogs also shows conflicting effects of capsicum and capsaicin on blood glucose and insulin levels when compared with control (40586, 40376). However, in vitro research shows that capsaicin inhibits intestinal glucose absorption (40831).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of capsicum constituents are thought to play a role in some of its clinical effects, including its anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects. Antioxidant effects have been shown both in human, animal, and laboratory research via the reduction of lipid oxidation and the inhibition of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), and other markers of oxidation (40389, 40515, 40517, 40423, 40626, 40694).\nAthletic performance effects\nExercise fatigue is associated with a decreased rate of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells, reducing the force of muscle contraction. Capsaicin is reported to activate TRPV 1 receptors in skeletal muscle, increasing calcium release and the force of muscle contraction (99409, 99410). Other potential mechanisms include the reduced oxidative costs of muscle contraction and an increase in epinephrine-induced plasma free fatty acid levels (105191).\nBone effects\nAfter menopause, taking a paprika extract rich in carotenoids for 6 months modifies bone markers, suggesting decreased bone resorption with no change in bone formation (105203).\nCardiovascular effects\nCapsaicin-induced vasodilation may be beneficial in conditions such as cluster headache and coronary artery disease. Topically, capsaicin appears to cause arterial vasodilation due to increased nitric oxide release which improved ischemic threshold during an exercise test in patients with stable coronary artery disease (14352, 40375, 40850, 40471). Furthermore, capsaicin seems to have antiplatelet effects in laboratory research and can decrease blood coagulation (7006, 12406, 12407). However, some clinical research shows that capsaicin does not impact platelet aggregation (92990).\n\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials also shows that taking capsicum as freshly chopped chili, fermented red pepper, red pepper capsules, or capsinoid capsules 2 mg to 32 grams orally daily for 4-12 weeks does not reduce heart rate when compared with control. However, most subjects included in these clinical trials did not have elevated heart rates at baseline (109025).\nDermatologic effects\nSome clinical research suggests that capsicum may improve microcirculation and protect tissue from hypoxia and ischemia in the setting of dermatologic surgery. Topical capsaicin cream applied to the upper back of adults increases superficial relative hemoglobin count and superficial and deep tissue oxygenation and velocity of dermal blood flow. These effects peaked 30 minutes after application and endured for up to 120 minutes (111519).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSome researchers theorize that capsaicin, a constituent of capsicum, might have gastroprotective effects. Preliminary evidence suggests that capsicum protects against alcohol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa. This has also led to the hypothesis that capsaicin might decrease the risk of peptic ulcer disease (12053). Capsaicin appears to induce the release of mucus to create a thick layer in the stomach in animals, which may explain its protective effect (40502, 40877). However, with heavy ingestion, capsaicin has been associated with necrosis, ulceration, and carcinogenesis (12404). In people with swallowing dysfunction, capsaicin is thought to provide sensory stimulation that increases the swallowing reflex (13100, 40516).\nRespiratory effects\nFor allergic and perennial rhinitis, it is not clear how capsaicin nasal spray might work. Like for pain syndromes, capsaicin likely depletes substance P, resulting in desensitization of the nasal mucosa to antigens (14324, 14354, 40450). Some research suggests that capsaicin does not cause significant changes in nasal neuronal tissue. Capsaicin is thought to possibly have anti-inflammatory effects. But some research suggests that capsaicin does not affect inflammatory cell density in the nasal mucosa (14322, 14324) or concentrations of inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes or prostaglandins (14328). In both human research and animal models of nasal hypersensitivity, intranasal capsaicin decreases substance P. In human research, the changes in substance P levels correlated with symptom improvement (14355, 105204). Other research in animal models suggests that intranasal capsaicin also decreases tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactive nerve fibers (14355). Capsaicin also stimulates the unmyelinated slow C-fibers of the sensory nervous system. C-fibers innervate the larynx, bronchi, and trachea, and other organs. Stimulation of C-fibers by capsaicin can induce cough, dyspnea, nasal congestion, and eye irritation after inhalation (5885, 40700). Some research with inhaled capsaicin suggests that severity of ACE inhibitor cough correlates with sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin (12411, 12412, 12413, 12414).\nSwallowing effects\nThere is interest in using capsaicin in patients with difficulty swallowing. Capsaicin is thought to activate peripheral C fibers and stimulate normal swallowing reflexes. In human research, oral capsaicin decreases substance P (105192). However, preliminary clinical research in adults with neurodegenerative diseases shows that taking a specific wafer product containing capsaicin (Capfilm, Yamada Bee Farm) 1.5 mcg orally once does not improve swallowing latency time when compared with placebo (109027).\nWeight loss effects\nCapsicum has been used and studied for weight loss (40599, 40745). Capsaicin and other constituents of capsicum appear to increase metabolic rate, energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and body temperature, which may contribute to weight loss (40434, 40453, 40539, 40553, 40692, 40762, 92988, 92992). Further research suggests that adding capsicum to meals can suppress appetite, which can result in decreased calorie consumption and subsequent weight loss (40341, 40617). Clinical research shows that an infusion of capsicum directly into the duodenum leads to a reduction in feelings of satiety but not feelings of hunger. The duodenal infusion of capsicum was associated with an increase in burning sensation, bloating, and nausea but not with a blood plasma increase in satiety hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or peptide YY (PYY) levels. It is hypothesized that the increased satiety associated with capsicum intake may be due to an elevation in gastrointestinal stress as opposed to an increase in satiety hormones (96455). Finally, capsicum appears to reduce postprandial insulin levels. Since insulin contributes to weight gain, the reduction insulin in the blood may then contribute to weight loss or prevent further weight gain (40512, 96457)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of caralluma are the aerial parts. Caralluma contains a variety of constituents including pregnane glycosides, megastigmane glycosides, saponins, and a variety of flavonoids (15272, 92083). It also contains beta-sitosterol (15273, 94083).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that beta-sitosterol isolated from caralluma is chemoprotective against colon and breast cancer cells. The mechanism of action is thought to be via inhibition of cell proliferation (94083).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research shows that ethanolic and aqueous extracts of caralluma have activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The flavonoids are thought to be responsible for this activity (94083).\nAntioxidant effects\nAntioxidant effects may be attributed to the phenolic compounds contained in methanolic extracts of caralluma. Beta-sitosterol isolated from caralluma may also act as an antioxidant (94083).\nAnxiolytic effects\nIn humans, the anxiolytic effects of caralluma are thought to be related to a decrease in cortisol levels (100000).\nLipid effects\nAnimal research shows that an aqueous extract of caralluma reduces methimazole induced elevations of total cholesterol and triglycerides (94083). The mechanism of caralluma's lipid effects is unclear.\nMusculoskeletal effects\nThere is interest in using caralluma for rheumatism. Extracts of caralluma may increase secretion of synovial fluid leading to increased mobility (94083).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using caralluma for weight loss. Pregnane glycosides are thought to be the active constituents in caralluma responsible for its weight loss effects (94080, 94081). They may act as an appetite suppressant by decreasing ghrelin synthesis as well as neuropeptide-Y, which leads to appetite suppression (94083, 106437). However, in a small clinical study in overweight and obese adults taking caralluma extract for 16 weeks, no differences in ghrelin concentrations were observed when compared with placebo (106437).\n\nIt is speculated that in genetic disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome, there is a decrease in serotonin mediated signaling, resulting in decreased signaling of being full. Pregnane glycosides may have selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) like activity, and this may be a possible mechanism of action for their functioning (94081).\n\nAdditionally, caralluma may block the formation of acetyl co-enzyme A and malonyl co-enzyme A, which are needed for fat synthesis (94083). Lastly, cell culture research shows that caralluma extract inhibits preadipocyte cell division (94082)."

Oral caraway in combination with peppermint and possibly other ingredients, seems to reduce symptoms of dyspepsia. It is unclear if oral caraway alone is beneficial.\nSeveral small, low-quality clinical studies and a meta-analysis of this research show that taking proprietary combinations of caraway oil 50 mg and peppermint oil 90 mg (Enteroplant or Menthacarin, Dr Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co.), 1-3 times daily for 4 weeks, improves quality of life and reduces symptoms of dyspepsia, including feelings of fullness, pain, and mild gastrointestinal (GI) spasms, when compared with placebo (6740, 6741, 10075, 96344, 102600). A meta-analysis of three of these clinical studies shows that taking this combination product 2-3 times daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces abdominal pain when compared with placebo (110091). This combination appears to be comparable to cisapride for relieving dyspepsia (6740, 6741, 10075). It also improves postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome, two subtypes of dyspepsia, when compared with placebo (96344). Another small clinical study in patients with functional dyspepsia shows that taking a combination of caraway oil 50 mg and L-menthol 41.4 mg (equivalent to 100 mg peppermint oil), in a microsphere formulation that releases the oils in the duodenum (FDgard, IM HealthScience LLC), twice daily for 28 days reduces symptoms of postprandial distress syndrome within 24 hours and reduces severe symptoms of epigastric pain syndrome at 28 days when compared with placebo. However, when all patients with functional dyspepsia are considered, symptom scores are not significantly different than placebo at 28 days (103161).\n\nAnother specific combination product containing caraway, peppermint leaf, clown's mustard plant, German chamomile, licorice root, milk thistle, angelica, celandine, and lemon balm (Iberogast, Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH) has also been evaluated in patients with dyspepsia, with promising results (7049). A meta-analysis of three small clinical studies using this combination product shows that taking 1 mL three times daily for 4 weeks reduces severity of acid reflux, epigastric pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting when compared with placebo (13089). Other clinical research in patients with dyspepsia shows that taking a similar combination product (STW 5-II, Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH) that does not contain milk thistle, angelica, or celandine as 1 mL three times daily for up to 8 weeks eliminates gastrointestinal symptoms in 40% more patients when compared with placebo (12724).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of caraway are the seed, fruits, and oils. The caraway fruits contain 2% to 7% volatile oil, which is obtained by steam distillation (103162). The main constituents of the oil are D-carvone and limonene, with smaller quantities of beta-myrcene, trans-dihydrocarvone, and trans-carveol (7, 103162). In addition to the oil, caraway fruits contain carbohydrates, proteins, fatty acids, flavonoids, and terpenoids (103162). Caraway seeds contain carveol, dihydrocarveol, thymol, and flavonoids (12736).\nAnti-allergy effects\nCaraway might have antihistamine activity (12735).\nAntibacterial effects\nCaraway might have antibacterial effects (12736). Cell culture research shows that caraway extracts and oil have activity against numerous organisms including: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Penicillium citrinum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces venezuelae, Shigella dysenteriae 1 and Shigella flexneri (similar to the activity of ampicillin), Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholera, Helicobacter pylori, Clavibacter, Curtobacterium, Rhodococcus, Erwinia, Xanthomonas, Ralstonia, and Agrobacterium (31471, 36131, 39759, 39774, 39838, 39839, 39840, 39845). Caraway essential oil has more activity against gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria (39806).\nAnticancer effects\nPreliminary evidence indicates that carvone, a volatile oil constituent of caraway, induces glutathione S-transferase (GST), which might inhibit carcinogenesis (11, 911).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nIn animal research, (s)-(+)-carvone, a major component of caraway oil, exhibited anticonvulsant activity (39800).\nAntidiabetes effects\nPreliminary research suggests that caraway might have anti hyperglycemic activity. This effect appears to be independent of insulin secretion. It might inhibit production of glucose by the liver or increase uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues (12736).\nAntifungal effects\nCell culture research shows that caraway has antifungal activity against Saccharomyces pastorianus, Candida albicans, Rhizopus nigricans, Aspergillus (fumigatus, niger, parasiticus, ochraceaus), Penicillium digitatum, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium moniliforme, Epidermatophyton, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (30655, 31344, 39834, 39835, 39836, 39837).\nDiuretic effects\nAnimal research shows that caraway fruit extract exhibits strong diuretic action without causing renal toxicity. The mechanism may involve two different activities, one having a furosemide-like activity and the other a thiazide-like activity (39797).\nGastrointestinal effects\nComponents of the essential oil of caraway have been shown to cause local stimulation of the gastric mucosa, which activates the vagus nerve, leading to an increase of stomach tonus and rhythmic contraction. The result of this action is an eructation of air from the stomach and an increase in gastric secretion (6742, 39854, 39855, 96344). Caraway may also have effects on bile flow (96344). A combination of caraway oil and peppermint oil seems to have a prokinetic effect in the GI tract, and also attenuates increased sensitivity to pain seen with chronic inflammation (102600).\nWeight loss effects\nThe carvacrol and fatty acids in caraway may contribute to its weight loss effects. It is thought these components may balance the microflora of the gut to help improve food digestion and absorption. These two components may also inhibit the growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, which may increase the amount of gut microflora present. Gut microflora disrupts the conversion of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes, preventing adipogenesis. Caraway may also possess antioxidant properties that lead to stimulation of apoptosis in pre-adipocytes and prevent adipogenesis via enhancement of lipolysis. Anti-inflammatory actions may also lead to inhibition of macrophage infiltration and prevention of adipogenesis (94086, 94088). Caraway may also have stimulating effects on the thyroid, which may contribute to decreased body weight (94087).\nWound healing effects\nThere is interest in using caraway seed extract topically for wound care. In rats with surgical wounds, applying caraway seed extract 10% or 20% gel daily seems to improve the wound healing ratio at day 10 when compared with no treatment, with results similar to tetracycline 3% ointment, possibly due to improved angiogenesis and collagen production (110443)."

It is sparingly soluble in organic solvents such as toluene, chloronaphthalene, and dichlorobenzene, and soluble in vegetable oils, especially those with a lower degree of saturation. To improve its solubility, carbon 60 can be encapsulated in carriers such as cyclodextrins or liposomes, or mixed with octanol, lecithin, or phospholipids (102447, 108495).\nAnti-aging effects\nGiving carbon 60 dissolved in olive oil, as 25 doses of 3.4 mg/kg spread over 7 months, to mature mice was associated with an extension of lifespan by 5% to 7% when compared with olive oil alone. However, the lifespan of mice given carbon 60 in olive oil was similar to that of mice given water, and olive oil alone decreased lifespan when compared with water. Carbon 60 had no effect on body weight, spontaneous locomotor activity, grip strength, blood glucose parameters, or blood chemistry parameters (108494).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro evidence shows that combining application of carbon 60 with light irradiation of 405 nm wavelengths decreases human leukemic cell viability by 46% (102482).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that carbon 60 decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Animal research in rats with experimentally induced arthritis shows that injecting carbon 60 into the ankle joint reduces synovitis, bone resorption and joint destruction when compared with injection of saline (102487).\nAnti-viral effects\nIn vitro research shows that a hydrophilic form of carbon 60 inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase and HIV aspartic protease; both enzymes are necessary for the virus life cycle and replication (102488).\nAntioxidant effects\nCarbon 60 is considered to be an efficient free radical scavenger because it has 30 carbon double bonds which can react with free radicals. It has been used in vitro and in vivo to protect cells and animals from free-radical damage (102447). Animal research shows that giving intraperitoneal carbon 60 protects against the cardiotoxicity from high dose doxorubicin, due to its hydroxyl radical scavenger activity (102486). Research in diabetic rats shows that carbon 60 reduces levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress, and increases levels of the antioxidants glutathione (GSH), alpha-tocopherol, retinol, stigmasterol, and beta-sitosterol (108496).\n\nLipophilic carbon 60 can be covalently modified or solubilized non-covalently by macromolecules to increase its hydrophilicity. Sometimes this modification leads to increased antioxidant properties, but it can also lead to pro-oxidant effects. Hydrophilic carbon 60 usually has antioxidant effects when it forms larger colloidal aggregates in water, while carbon 60 with greater dispersion that forms smaller colloids or aggregates tends to have pro-oxidant effects (102485, 102488). These aggregates can generate reactive oxygen species which can cause damage (108495).\n\nThe antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects of carbon 60 can vary in different body organs. Carbon 60 is associated with increased levels of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the brain, but with decreased levels of MDA in the heart, decreased levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the heart and liver, and decreased levels of AOPP in the spleen (108495).\nBody weight effects\nGiving carbon 60 in an olive oil and coconut oil mixture to rats as 5 mg/kg daily for 12 weeks does not change food or water intake, but attenuates increases in body mass, when compared with the oil mixture alone (108495).\nHyperglycemic effects\nResearch in rats suggests that carbon 60 increases glucose and insulin serum levels and increases insulin resistance (108495). It is proposed that carbon 60 may modify gut microflora by decreasing levels of Prevotella bacteria that are succinate producers. This is thought to improve glycemic control (108495).\nLipid effects\nResearch in rats suggests that carbon 60 decreases triglyceride levels and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. It is proposed that it modifies gut microflora, favoring bacteria that decrease serum triglycerides (108495). An animal study also suggests that carbon 60 reduces accumulation of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol in the lungs, protecting against associated tissue damage (108496).\nRenal effects\nTheoretically carbon 60 might alter the function of albumin. In vitro research shows that human serum albumin undergoes conformational and functional changes when it binds with carbon 60 (102484)."

However, other small clinical studies show that taking cardamom 1 gram three times daily does not reduce fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, or total cholesterol levels, or improve anthropometric measures in patients with type 2 diabetes (95597, 99436, 101887).\nless\nDyspepsia. Although there has been interest in using oral cardamom for dyspepsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cardamom for this purpose.\nEpilepsy. Although there has been interest in using oral cardamom essential oil for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cardamom for this purpose.\nHyperlipidemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral cardamom may modestly reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hyperlipidemia, but it does not seem to improve other lipid levels in these patients.\nA meta-analysis of mostly small randomized controlled trials shows that taking cardamom 3 grams daily for 8-12 weeks does not improve total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. However, it might modestly reduce triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (101886).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral cardamom powder is beneficial in patients with hypertension.\nA small clinical study in adults with newly-diagnosed, untreated, stage 1 essential hypertension shows that taking cardamom powder 1.5 grams orally twice daily for 12 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by about 19 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by about 12 mmHg when compared to baseline (95308). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Fatty liver grade, as measured by sonography, improved in 42% of patients taking cardamom, compared with 4.5% of those taking placebo. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, and insulin resistance also improved by a moderate amount. However, taking cardamom did not affect fasting blood glucose, body mass index (BMI), or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (101885).\nless\nObesity.

The treatment effect appears to vary depending on the number of emetic drugs given during anesthesia or postoperatively, and whether the drugs were given during or after the operation (77054). Another small study shows that aromatherapy with a mixture of ginger, spearmint, peppermint, and cardamom, as 3 inhalations from a gauze pad, reduces nausea scores by 43% when compared with placebo. When compared with ginger aromatherapy alone, nausea scores were reduced by 15%.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of cardamom are the seed and the essential oil extracted by steam distillation from the seed and fruit pods (11, 18). The main components of the oil are alpha-terpinyl acetate and 1,8-cineole, with lesser amounts of limonene, sabinene, bisabolene, linalool, linalyl acetate, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, alpha-terpineol, camphene, myrcene, terpinene, alpha-phellandrene, 1,4-cineole, nerolidol, citronellol, p-cymene, geraniol, and borneol (11, 39877, 39884, 39907, 101885). Also present are acetic, butyric, decanoic, dodecanoic, citronellic, geranic, hexanoic, heptanoic, nerylic, and perillic acids (11). The composition of the oil varies with the geographic source (11). An ethanol extract of cardamom powder contains epicatechin, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, trans-ferulic acid, and ellagic acid (96202).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nClinical research and animal studies show that cardamom has anti-inflammatory effects (39907, 107920). Taking cardamom powder 1 gram three times daily for 16 weeks significantly reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) when compared with placebo in one clinical study (107920). In rats, intraperitoneal injection of cardamom essential oil 280 microliters/kg resulted in an 86% reduction in carrageenan-induced paw edema (39907).\nAnticancer effects\nGiving cardamom powder orally to mice, starting 15 days prior to applying chemicals to induce skin cancer, reduced tumor incidence and tumor burden. This may be due to antioxidant mechanisms including a reduction in lipid peroxidation and an increase in levels of reduced glutathione (96201).\nAntimicrobial effects\nCardamom essential oil has in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Salmonella typhimurium (31330). It is also sporicidal against Bacillus subtilis (39895). A methanol extract of cardamom seed has activity against Helicobacter pylori (39783). The essential oil has in vitro antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger (31330). An extract of ground cardamom seed has in vitro antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum (39881).\nAntioxidant effects\nPowdered cardamom 100 grams is reported to contain 50-100 mg of antioxidant flavonoids (39867). In obese rats, an ethanol extract of cardamom powder improved antioxidant enzyme activity, and reduced lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress (96202). In humans, taking cardamom powder orally, 1.5 grams twice daily for 12 weeks, increased antioxidant activity in the blood by 90% (95308).\nAntiplatelet effects\nPreliminary data from an ex vivo study suggest that an aqueous extract of powdered cardamom can inhibit human platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen, or epinephrine (39878). Mechanisms by which cardamom inhibits platelet aggregation may include interference with calcium transport across platelet membranes, increased adenylate cyclase activity and cyclic-AMP levels inside platelets, and interaction with glycoprotein IIb-IIIa to prevent binding of fibrinogen (95306).\nCardiovascular effects\nExtracts of dried cardamom reduce arterial blood pressure in rats, and the effect is partially blocked by atropine, suggesting a cholinergic mechanism (39884). Cardamom seed volatile oil reduces arterial blood pressure and heart rate when given intravenously to rats, and the bradycardia is antagonized by atropine (39910). Organic extracts of cardamom are reported to have calcium channel blocking activity, which may contribute to blood pressure-lowering effects (39884).\nDiuretic effects\nIn a study in rats, an extract of powdered cardamom exhibited diuretic effects, increasing urine volume and enhancing the urinary excretion of sodium and potassium (39884).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAn aqueous extract of cardamom, and small doses of the volatile oil, produce contractions in isolated rabbit jejunum and guinea pig ileum preparations via a cholinergic mechanism which is antagonized by atropine (39884, 39910). Larger doses of the volatile oil have antispasmodic and relaxant effects, mediated through anticholinergic effects at muscarinic receptors (39907, 39910).\n\nIn a study in rats, cardamom essential oil, and a petroleum ether extract from the dried fruits, were protective against ethanol-induced and aspirin-induced gastric ulcer formation (29879).\nImmune effects\nAn aqueous extract of cardamom increases white blood cell proliferation and enhances the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells. It also reduces interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 release from pro-inflammatory T1 cells, and increases release of interleukins 4, 5, 6, 10, and 13 from anti-inflammatory T2 cells (39896)."

The root contains about 2% essential oil, of which up to 99% is carlina oxide (2-(3-phenylprop-1-ynyl)furan) (99897, 112329). It also contains small amounts of benzaldehyde, curcumene, beta-sesquiphellandrene, and alpha-zingiberene (112758). The leaves are rich in polyphenols and triterpenes (112329).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that oral administration of carlina essential oil reduces chemically induced edema in rats. Carlina oxide, the primary constituent in carlina essential oil, seems to reduce inflammation, and therefore edema, via antioxidant activity, such as the scavenging of free radicals (103808).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research shows that carlina essential oil and its constituent carlina oxide have strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, S. sciuri, S. warneri, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Corynebacterium striatum, and Enterococcus faecalis (99897, 103808, 112758). The essential oil and carlina oxide have very little activity against Gram negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but a nano-emulsion formulation containing encapsulated essential oil has some weak activity, possibly due to improved penetration into cells (112758).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro research shows that carlina essential oil and its constituent carlina oxide have activity against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, other Candida species, and Aspergillus niger (99897, 103808, 112758).\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn vitro research shows that the primary constituent in carlina essential oil, carlina oxide, has activity against Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes the cattle disease nagana. This parasitic disease is closely related to African sleeping sickness. Researchers suggest that carlina oxide inhibits trypanothione reductase, an enzyme necessary for the survival of this parasite (99897).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro research shows that carlina oxide can bind to sites on the receptor binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), reducing the binding of the virus to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2, and reducing its entry into cells (112329).\nGastroprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that oral administration of carlina essential oil reduces the size and severity of chemically induced gastric ulcers in rats. Carlina oxide, the primary constituent in carlina essential oil, may produce gastroprotective effects via antioxidant activity, such as the scavenging of free radicals (103808)."

Although there is interest in using oral carnosine for Alzheimer disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of carnosine for this condition.\nAthletic performance. Oral carnosine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome research has evaluated carnosine in combination with beta-alanine. One small clinical study in muscle-fatigued healthy males shows that taking a combination of carnosine 2 grams plus beta-alanine 2 grams as a single dose 4 hours prior to testing increases maximal voluntary muscle contractions during knee extensions by 15% and jump height by 6% when compared with placebo. However, muscle pain was increased after 24 hours following use of carnosine and beta-alanine (94232). In another small clinical trial in healthy males, taking a single dose of carnosine 2.5 grams plus beta-alanine 2.5 grams (DDM Carnosina, Omeopiacenza Srl, Pontenure) does not affect most measures of athletic performance, including perceived exertion, work rate, maximum workload, and oxygen use, when compared with placebo. However, there was a small benefit on the ventilatory threshold during one test (106079).\n\nOther research has evaluated carnosine in combination with anserine. One small clinical study shows that taking a single dose of a specific chicken breast extract (CBEX) 40 grams containing 1.5 grams of carnosine and anserine orally does not affect power during maximal cycle ergometer sprints when compared with placebo in healthy active males (39938). However, a very small study shows that taking a single dose of pure carnosine and anserine 20 mg/kg each improves power by 6.1% in the first 5 seconds of a cycling performance test following 6-minutes of high intensity cycling. There was no effect on mean power, time to peak power, or time to power drop during the performance test. When power was measured over three consecutive cycling performance tests, peak power was increased by 2.5% when compared with placebo (106085).\nless\nCataracts.

Although there is interest in using oral carnosine for diabetic neuropathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of carnosine for this condition.\nDry mouth. Topical carnosine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with dry mouth shows that use of a specific mucoadhesive tablet (Aqualief, Helsinn Healthcare SA), containing a combination of carnosine and Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces, 400 mg three times daily after meals for 6 days increases saliva production and improves symptoms of dry mouth when compared to baseline. While saliva production was also increased in patients taking placebo, the increase was 3-fold greater with the combination product, and significant improvements in dry mouth symptoms were lacking in the placebo group (103288). In another small trial in patients with radiation-induced dry mouth, taking the same tablets (marketed as Salifluss, Metis Healthcare srl) for 8 days increases saliva production by about 30% when compared with placebo. However, symptoms of dry mouth were not improved (106087). It is unclear if these findings are due to carnosine, Hibiscus sabdariffa, or the combination.\nless\nDry skin. Topical carnosine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with diabetes and severe dry skin of the foot shows that using a cream containing urea 5%, arginine 0.5%, and carnosine 0.01% (Ureadin Podos Db cream) twice daily for 8 months improves skin hydration and reduces xerosis when compared with a control emollient cream. The carnosine cream reduced xerosis by 91% over baseline, compared with a 23% reduction with the control cream (93999).\nless\nGlaucoma. Oral carnosine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with primary open angle glaucoma shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Gangliolife, SOOFT Italia) as two tablets twice daily for 1 year in addition to standard topical therapy results in a decrease in intraocular pressure when compared with standard therapy alone. One tablet of the supplement contains carnosine 50 mg, coleus extract 150 mg (standardized to 10% forskolin), homotaurine 100 mg, vitamin B1 1.1 mg, vitamin B2 1.4 mg, vitamin B6 1.4 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, and magnesium 150 mg (91886). It is not clear if this effect is due to carnosine, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nGulf war syndrome. It is unclear if oral carnosine is beneficial in patients with Gulf war syndrome.\nIn patients with Gulf war syndrome, preliminary clinical research shows that taking carnosine 500 mg, 1000 mg, or 1500 mg daily as add-on therapy for 4 weeks each, and then tapered over 2 weeks, has little benefit on symptoms associated with this illness. Taking carnosine modestly reduces the number of patients with diarrhea and also modestly improves some scores on specific cognitive tests. However, other symptoms of the illness, such as fatigue, pain, and reduced activity, were not improved (93996).\nless\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral carnosine is beneficial for heart failure.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients using standard treatment shows that taking carnosine 500 mg daily for 6 months might improve the peak oxygen uptake by 4.5% during a cardiopulmonary stress test, compared to a decrease of 3.8% in patients not using carnosine. This change resulted in improvements in maximal workload and a 59.4-meter increase in 6-minute walking distance, compared to a decrease of 10.6 meters in the control group (94235).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral carnosine is beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nMeta-analyses of mostly small clinical trials show that taking carnosine 1-3 grams daily for up to 12 weeks does not improve total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with placebo. (103287, 111263). However, it is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients with hyperlipidemia; the studies included in this analysis focused on patients who were obese or had diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral carnosine is beneficial for patients with metabolic syndrome.\nObservational research in adults at risk for metabolic syndrome has found that taking carcinine, a metabolite of carnosine, 60 mg daily for 8 weeks is associated with improvements in blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, serum insulin, insulin resistance, and total cholesterol when compared with a control group (111265). The validity of these findings is limited the retrospective nature of the study, which includes a lack of randomization, blinding, and placebo control.\nless\nObesity. Oral carnosine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing cinnamon extract 456 mg, chromium guanylate 2.5 mg, and carnosine 400 mg (Glycabiane, PiLeJe) daily for 4 months reduces fasting blood glucose levels and fat-free mass when compared with placebo. However, there were no changes in glycated hemoglobin, insulin sensitivity, or body weight (94234). It is not clear if these effects are due to carnosine, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral carnosine is beneficial for OCD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking carnosine 500 mg twice daily in combination with fluvoxamine for 10 weeks reduces compulsive symptoms, but not obsessive symptoms, in adults with moderate to severe OCD when compared with fluvoxamine alone. However, the degree of symptom reduction might not be considered clinically meaningful (97338).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral carnosine for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of carnosine for this use.\nPressure ulcers. It is unclear if oral carnosine is beneficial for pressure ulcer healing.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking carnosine might help with the healing of pressure ulcers in patients also treated with standard care. Taking carnosine 116 mg for 4 weeks increased the rate of healing by approximately 50% when compared with a control group receiving standard care alone (97601).\nless\nSchizophrenia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral carnosine does not improve symptoms of schizophrenia.\nOne small clinical study of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are on stable doses of antipsychotics shows that taking carnosine titrated from 500 mg daily up to 2000 mg over 4 weeks, continued for an additional 8 weeks and then tapered for 2 weeks, does not improve symptoms of depression or schizophrenia or improve quality of life when compared with placebo (93997). Another small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia with predominantly negative symptoms shows that taking carnosine 400 mg daily for 12 weeks and then titrating up to 800 mg daily until 24 weeks does not improve positive or negative symptoms when compared with placebo. Measures of cognitive function, with the exception of an executive functioning test, were not improved with carnosine over placebo (111264).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate carnosine for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with carnosine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCarnosine is absorbed intact in the jejunum (93997). Laboratory research suggests absorption is carrier-mediated (39950).\nDistribution\nCarnosine is concentrated in skeletal muscle, heart muscle, and nerve and brain tissue (39922, 39939). In humans, at least some research suggests that carnosine supplementation increases carnosine levels in the muscle (16438).\nMetabolism\nCarnosine is metabolized in the blood by carnosinase to beta-alanine and histidine (93997).\nExcretion\nCarnosine is excreted in the urine after breakdown to individual amino acids (93997).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCarnosine is a naturally occurring di-peptide found in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and other innervated tissues. Carnosine is formed by a process involving the enzyme carnosine synthetase, which bonds the amino acids beta-alanine and L-histidine. The enzyme carnosinase maintains the carnosine equilibrium by inactivating carnosine located in tissues or blood (3381, 3391).\nAnti-Alzheimer effects\nCarnosine may play a role in the prevention of Alzheimer disease. The anti-glycating and antioxidant activities of carnosine are both implicated in the neuronal and endothelial cell damage of Alzheimer disease (10645). Carnosine binds heavy metals and may provide some protection from zinc- and copper-mediated neurotoxicity (7219). The ability of carnosine to bind heavy metals may also be important in its ability to act as an antioxidant (10211).\nAnti-cataract effects\nCarnosine is thought to have protective effects against cataracts. In animal models, carnosine has antioxidant effects on the lens and protects against cataracts (39946, 39948). Carnosine may delay cataract formation via antiglycation and other antioxidative activity (39941).\nAntiaging effects\nCarnosine levels might decrease with age, with levels in animals corresponding to life expectancy (94235). Carnosine is of interest as an anti-aging product because of its effects on advance glycosylation end-products (AGEs). AGEs are abnormal, cross-linked, and oxidized proteins that might play a role in the aging process. Animal and in vitro studies show that carnosine may diminish the glycosylation of these proteins, preventing them from inducing cellular damage (3364, 10210, 10645, 39939, 100484).\nAntidiabetic effects\nCarnosine is of interest as an anti-diabetic product because of its effects on advance glycosylation end-products (AGEs). AGEs are abnormal, cross-linked, and oxidized proteins that might play a role in the damage occurring during diabetes. Because carnosine appears to diminish the effects of protein glycosylation, there is some interest in using carnosine for complications of diabetes such as cataracts, neuropathy, and kidney failure, which arise from glycosylation (3364, 39934).\n\nThere is also interest in using carnosine for preventing the development of diabetes. Adipokines are chemicals that help regulate glucose metabolism. In a small clinical study in obese patients without diabetes, taking carnosine 2 gram daily for 12 weeks reduced levels of resistin, an adipokine, but not leptin or adipsin (100479). There is also interest in the effects of carnosine on glucose metabolism via modulation of iron metabolism. A small clinical study in obese patients shows that carnosine supplementation reduces plasma soluble transferrin receptor when compared with placebo. This suggests that carnosine affects iron metabolism and therefore might lead to improved insulin resistance and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (100480).\nAntioxidant effects\nThere is some animal evidence that carnosine can help prevent lipid peroxidation within the cell membranes. Carnosine may block malondialdehyde (MDA) production, which is a toxic lipid peroxidation end-product. Animal studies show carnosine can inhibit MDA-induced protein changes and MDA-induced toxicity (3364, 3381, 10644). Blocking MDA might decrease oxidative damage to lipids, as well as to enzymes and DNA. This raises the question of whether carnosine might play a role in preventing atherosclerosis, joint inflammation, and cataract formation (3364, 3381, 39935).\nAppetite effects\nCarnosine is of interest for reducing the incidence of binge eating. Carnosine potentially plays a role in the central histaminergic and glutamatergic systems, both involved in the regulation of eating (106080).\nCognitive effects\nCarnosine has shown some benefit on cognitive effects in human research (39926, 94000). The mechanism of action is not clear. However, in the brain, carnosine might have antioxidant effects and inhibit protein glycation. In animal models, carnosine has neuroprotective effects following ischemia (93997). Also, in humans, carnosine reduces levels of inflammatory cytokines and prevented the suppression in brain blood flow (94000). Other research suggests that carnosine can act as a neurotransmitter and affect the glutamatergic system (106086).\nErgogenic effects\nCarnosine is thought to benefit exercise performance, possibly by improving muscle strength (39938, 94232). Increasing carnosine levels in the blood appears to improve muscle contraction and power and reduce fatigue (39924, 94232). Beta-alanine supplementation increases carnosine levels in the muscle (93983, 93998). These increases were related to improved rowing performance in athletes (93983), but not to a longer cycling time-trial (93998). In the muscle, it appears that carnosine buffers increased hydrogen ion concentrations following high-intensity work. This is thought to improve muscle performance although this has not always been shown clinically (39936, 39938, 93983, 93998). Other possible mechanisms of action include increasing sensitivity related to calcium release in the muscle cell, antioxidant effects, or vasodilation (93983).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nCarnosine seems to be concentrated in actively contracting muscles. In patients with muscular dystrophies carnosine levels may be lower. The concentration of carnosine in muscles also appears to correlate with age. Older patients have lower muscle carnosine levels (3391). Preliminary information also suggests that carnosine may play a role in the regulation of intracellular calcium and contractility in cardiac tissue (3390).\nWound healing effects\nIn human research, taking carnosine improved healing of pressure ulcers. The mechanism of action is not clear. However, carnosine does improve wound healing in animal models. This is possibly related to benefits on fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Also, carnosine might protect against oxidative stress (97601)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of carob is the fruit. The carob pod contains 40% to 55% sweet carbohydrates by weight. The pod also contains dietary fiber and polyphenols (97846, 111573). Carob fiber contains 24 polyphenol compounds with a yield of about 4 grams/kg (dry weight). The main polyphenols are derivatives of gallic acid including free gallic acid (42%), gallotannins (29%), methyl gallate (1%), and simple phenols such as cinnamic acid (about 2%). Flavonoids represented 26% of the polyphenols (39985, 39992, 111573). Carob also contains cyclitols, including D-pinitol, also known as 3-O-methyl-D-chiro-inositol (111573). The galactomannan content of carob is found in the endosperm of the seed (111573).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn an animal model of metabolic syndrome, adding carob pods and seeds to a high fat-high sucrose (HFHS) diet for 26 weeks decreased expression of inflammatory markers, including interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase 2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, when compared with mice receiving an HFHS diet without carob (104238).\nAnticancer effects\nLaboratory research suggests that carob leaf and pod extracts reduce the proliferation and induce apoptosis of cancer cell lines. The mechanism might be related to the high levels of gallic acid constituents (39979, 40029).\nAntidiabetes effects\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, carob gum decreased the glucose response when eating a high glycemic index food (40014). Animal research shows that consuming a diet containing 15% carob gum for 2-6 weeks reduces blood glucose levels, cholesterol levels, and insulin levels, and increases glucose tolerance (11). Also, in an animal model of metabolic syndrome, adding carob pod extract to the diet improved insulin resistance (111129). The polyphenols and fiber in carob gum are possibly responsible for the antidiabetic effects of carob (111573).\nAntioxidant effects\nLaboratory research shows carob pods and seeds contain polyphenols, such as gallic acid and gallotannins, which exert antioxidant effects (104238).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn animal models of metabolic syndrome, adding carob pods and seeds or carob pod extract to the diet decreased blood pressure through improved endothelial function. Carob also demonstrated cardioprotective benefits by improving heart contractility, decreasing expression of inflammatory markers, and reducing oxidative stress (104238, 111129).\nFertility effects\nIn one clinical study of men with infertility of various etiologies, carob pod extract increased sperm count and motility. However, it did not affect any hormones levels when compared to the control group (104236).\nHypolipidemic effects\nThe insoluble fiber of carob pod pulp has exhibited hypocholesterolemic effects in animal and human research (97846). In animal models of metabolic syndrome, adding carob pods and seeds or carob pod extract to the diet reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (104238, 111129).\nWeight loss effects\nIn humans, consumption of a carob pulp preparation resulted in changes in blood levels of hormones, triglycerides, and fatty acids, suggesting an increase in fat utilization (39998). Also, in an animal model of metabolic syndrome, adding carob pod extract to the diet reduced body weight (111129). The polyphenol constituents of carob are thought to contribute to weight loss through a variety of metabolic pathways (104237)."

            "Overview": "Carrageenan belongs to a family of naturally occurring, gel-forming polysaccharides extracted from various species of Rhodophyceae red seaweeds (102358). Carrageenan is added to processed foods for its gelling, thickening, and emulsifying properties. It has no nutritional value. The three main types of carrageenan include kappa-, iota-, and lambda-carrageenan (99466, 102876). Carrageenan has been on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) list of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) products since 1959. In 2008, a citizens' petition questioned the safety of degraded carrageenan. In April 2012, the FDA re-tested and confirmed its GRAS status (99466, 102358).",

Poligeenan contains a lower molecular weight product that is partially absorbed. There is concern about the safety of this form because it has been linked to colonic lesions, neoplasms, and bleeding in animals (40065, 40047). Due to public concern that commercial carrageenan contains poligeenan or can be degraded to poligeenan in the stomach, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reevaluated the safety of carrageenan and reaffirmed its status as GRAS in 2012 (99466). Carrageenan that is not degraded has an average molecular weight of 453-652 kDA, while degraded carrageenan is usually 20-30 kDA. In order to limit potential safety concerns, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Food advises that the total weight of any carrageenan food additives contain no more than 5% of a molecular weight below 50 kDa (99901).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of carrageenan when used topically.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used in food amounts (11).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of carrageenan.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCarrageenan is a family of gel-forming polysaccharides or hydrocolloids from species of Rhodophyceae red seaweeds. It is composed of sulfated and unsulfated D-galactose residues linked in alternating beta-1,4- and alpha-1,3-galactose to galactose bonds (105819). The three main types of carrageenan are kappa-, iota-, and lambda-carrageenan. Differences between these carrageenan types include solubility, gelling properties, the quantity and position of ester sulfate groups, and the quantity of 3,6-anhydro-D-galactose units (11, 99466). The estimated intake of carrageenans varies from 0 to 140 mg/kg daily, depending on the quantity of processed foods in the diet (105819, 105821).\n\nDegraded carrageenan, also called poligeenan, has an average molecular weight of 20-30 kDa, which is much lower than the average molecular weight of undegraded carrageenan (453-652 kDa). A study evaluating 29 samples of food-grade carrageenan found that poligeenan was not detectable in any of the samples. However, the limit of detection was 5% (99901).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that carrageenan products prevent mucosal HIV transmission and infection (40051, 40060). In animal models, carrageenan-based products protect against herpes simplex mucosal infection (40045, 40053, 40067). In vitro, carrageenan inhibits herpes simplex virus replication (40041). Additionally, carrageenan inhibits human papillomavirus binding to cells in vitro (40056).\nGlycemic effects\nResearch into the effects of carrageenan on blood glucose levels is conflicting. In humans without diabetes, incorporation of lambda-carrageenan into a standard meal to increase the dietary fiber content from 3.45 grams to 14.84 grams reduces the postprandial glycemic response (40043). Also, feeding rats a high-fat diet containing 3% low-molecular-weight carrageenan (<2 kDa) for 30 days reduces postprandial blood glucose, but not fasting blood glucose, when compared with the high-fat diet alone (105820).\n\nHowever, giving high-molecular-weight carrageenan to mice for 3 months to 1 year increases fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and deceases hepatic and muscle glycogen stores (105821, 105823). It also exacerbates the glucose intolerance induced by a high-fat diet (105823). Animal studies also indicate that carrageenan-induced inflammation produced via the innate immunity pathway is associated with insulin resistance and impairs insulin signaling in the liver (105819, 105823). Carrageenan causes insulin and glucose resistance in mice by competitively binding to insulin receptors to interfere with insulin binding, and by suppressing expression of glucose transporters and glycogen synthase (105821).\n\nIn humans with untreated prediabetes for at least 3 months, consuming a carrageenan-free diet for 12 weeks reduces HbA1c and the homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) when compared with baseline, but not when compared with a carrageenan-containing diet (105819). The validity of this study is limited by a very high drop-out rate.\nInflammatory effects\nCarrageenan is used to stimulate inflammation in animal models for testing anti-inflammatory agents (40049, 40050, 40066, 105823). It causes inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells by activating an innate immunity pathway, upregulating inflammatory genes, and also increasing production of reactive oxygen species (105819, 105821). In animals, it can cause intestinal ulceration and inflammatory bowel disease (105821). A small clinical study in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission who were following a carrageenan-free diet shows that taking capsules providing carrageenan 200 mg daily for up to 1 year is associated with disease relapse in 3 of 5 patients, compared with no relapses in 7 patients taking placebo capsules (105822).\nLipid effects\nResearch into the effects of carrageenan on lipid levels is conflicting. In rats on a high-fat diet, a low-molecular-weight carrageenan (<2 kDa) decreased total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with the high-fat diet alone (105820). Also, clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that carrageenan-enriched foods seem to decrease total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increase levels of HDL cholesterol (40052). However, in mice with dyslipidemia induced by a high-fat diet, giving high-molecular-weight carrageenan exacerbates the dyslipidemia (105823)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCarrot contains beta-carotene, which is primarily in the trans-isomer form. Beta-carotene is absorbed into the plasma after being transferred in the stomach from the vegetable matrix to the fat phase of the meal (60137). However, some clinical evidence shows that beta-carotene from carrot juice is absorbed less readily than beta-carotene powder dispersed in water, suggesting that carrot fiber hinders beta-carotene absorption (34490). Other clinical research suggests that red carrots may be a reasonable source of lycopene, although lycopene from red carrot appears to be only 44% as bioavailable as lycopene from tomato paste. Combining white carrots, which do not contain lycopene, with tomato paste appears to hinder the absorption of lycopene from the tomato paste, suggesting that carrot fiber also decreases the bioavailability of lycopene (25825). Other clinical evidence shows that anthocyanins from purple carrot are absorbed into plasma within 30 minutes of carrot consumption, with peak level occurring 1.5-2.5 hours after consumption. Acylated anthocyanins appear to be absorbed less readily than nonacylated anthocyanins, likely due to the hydrophobic nature of the acylated form. Roughly 76% of the total content of anthocyanins are acylated. The amount of nonacylated anthocyanins in human plasma is 4 times higher than that of acylated anthocyanins. Increasing the amount of purple carrot consumed, from 250 grams to 500 grams, does not increase the amount of anthocyanins recovered in the urine, suggesting that there is a saturation point of absorption. However, this saturation point is not currently known (25833, 96308).\nMetabolism\nOnce absorbed, carrot beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A. In general, the amount of beta-carotene from any source that is absorbed and converted to vitamin A depends upon the individual's vitamin A status, beta-carotene body stores, and the amount of beta-carotene ingested (2628, 8044). Some of the ingested beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A in the intestinal mucosa (2628). Although beta-carotene is partly metabolized to vitamin A, high intake of beta-carotene does not result in vitamin A toxicity because the proportion converted to vitamin A decreases as beta-carotene intake increases (8044).\nExcretion\nThe plasma half-life of beta-carotene from carrot juice is approximated to be 6-11 days (34490). Anthocyanins from purple carrot are excreted in the urine (25833).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCarrot contains carotenoids, especially alpha- and beta-carotenes, and dietary fiber (25819, 25821, 25825, 31703, 52943, 96307, 96308). Carrot also contains precursors to the lignans enterodiol and enterolactone (75546). Red carrot contains lycopene (25825). Purple carrot contains anthocyanins (25833). Anthocyanin gives purple carrot its color (96308).\nAnticancer effects\nThe carotenoids in carrot are thought to be responsible for its anticancer effects. Carotenoids can decrease oxidative DNA damage. Additionally, some carotenoids may be converted to vitamin A, which is thought to help prevent cancer. In laboratory research, beta-carotene has inhibited growth in prostate cancer cells through modulation of the cav-1 pathway. It has also inhibited the growth of prostate tumor cells in mice. In population research, increased intake of carrot was associated with decreased odds of developing prostate or breast cancer (96307, 101715).\nAntioxidant effects\nBeta-carotene seems to have antioxidant activities and prevent lipid peroxidation (139). While carrots contain a significant amount of beta-carotene, it is unclear if carrots have strong antioxidant activity. Preliminary clinical evidence shows that drinking 330 mL of carrot juice daily for 2 weeks reduces oxidative base damage in healthy men (60295). However, other clinical research shows that drinking this amount of carrot juice for the same duration does not reduce lipid peroxidation (34512, 60295, 60359).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSome clinical research shows that daily carrot consumption increases gastrointestinal transit time, fiber intake, and fecal weight in healthy adults (25823, 31703). However, evidence from other clinical research shows that supplementing a diet with powdered carrot fiber does not significantly affect colonic motility in healthy adults (25810). In children, a carrot-rice-based rehydration solution appears to significantly decrease the duration of diarrhea, mean fecal output, and mean fluid intake compared to two conventional glucose-based rehydration solutions (25818).\nHypoglycemic effects\nPreliminary clinical evidence shows that consuming a single meal containing processed and cooked carrot 200-300 grams significantly lowers glucose levels, as well as insulin and C-peptide responses, compared to eating the same meal without carrot (25813).\nWeight loss effects\nPatients that are overweight or obese are in a constant state of chronic, low-grade inflammation. This inflammation may lead to cardiovascular and endothelial dysfunction, as well as atherosclerosis. Purple carrots, which contain anthocyanins, are thought to inhibit cytokines and inflammatory pathways such as nuclear factor kappa beta, reducing inflammation associated with obesity. Anthocyanins may also suppress the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) pathway to decrease lipids. However in one clinical trial, supplementation with purple carrot for 4 weeks did not result in weight loss or improvements in lipid parameters in overweight or obese males (96308)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of cascara sagrada.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of cascara sagrada is the dried bark. The major active constituents of cascara sagrada are the anthraquinone glycosides known as cascarosides A, B, C, and D (6, 92307). Other constituents include emodin, frangulin, iso-emodin, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol, rhein, aloin, malic acid, tannic acid, and hydroxy anthracene derivatives (30725, 40074).\nAntitumor activity\nThe role of cascara sagrada and its constituents as antitumor or chemopreventive agents is unclear. Some in vitro and animal research suggests that cascara sagrada has anticancer activity due to its emodin and aloe-emodin content (40074, 40077, 40078, 40079, 40080, 40103, 40104). Emodin, an anthraquinone, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (40079). It appears to exert antitumor properties possibly by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation (40103) and inducing cell cycle arrest (40103), apoptosis (40072, 40078, 40080, 40103) and tumor cell death (40071). Emodin has been shown to have highly selective activities against src-Her-2/neu and ras-oncogenes (40104). In addition, emodin has been shown to increase the repair of DNA damaged human cells (40105) and reduce the invasiveness of human cancer cells (40081). Additionally, in vitro research show that aloe-emodin induces p53 and p21 expression resulting in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase (40077). While some evidence shows that cascara sagrada inhibits carcinogenesis (40075), other research suggests that cascara sagrada might actually promote carcinogensis (40097). Additionally, some research suggests that emodin may have genotoxic activity (30746).\nHepatic effects\nIn vitro studies suggest that cascara sagrada decreases intracellular glutathione concentrations. Though it is theorized that the decreased glutathione levels may be due to inhibition of gamma-glutamyl transferase, further investigation found that cascara sagrada increases activity of gamma-glutamyl transferase. The mechanism of intracellular glutathione inhibition by cascara sagrada remains unclear (110704).\n\nIn vitro research also shows that cascara sagrada increases mRNA gene expression of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes in a human liver cancer cell line by dose-dependent activation of human pregnane X receptor (110704).\nLaxative effects\nThe anthraglycoside constituents, cascarosides A and B, stimulate peristalsis and evacuation leading to stimulant laxative effects (6). Cascara sagrada exerts its effect on the large intestine and does not have much effect on the small intestine. Intestinal bacteria are required to transform the anthraglycosides into stimulant laxatives (2)."

Consuming casein peptide as part of formula with or without breastmilk for up to 6 months reduces the risk of atopic dermatitis in infants.\nClinical research shows that feeding infants a casein peptide-based formula (Nutramigen or Progestimil, Mead Johnson), with or without breastmilk for 4-6 months, reduces the risk for atopic dermatitis during the first 9-24 months of life by 52% to 73% when compared to cow's milk formula (91655, 91656, 91658). The benefits of casein peptides appear to be most significant in infants with a family history of atopy (91655, 91656). Additionally, the benefit of using a casein peptide-based formula during the first 4 months of life persists into childhood, with a 29% reduced risk of developing atopic dermatitis at 6 years of age when compared to cow's milk formula (91659, 91660). Clinical research also shows that casein peptide formula is equally effective to hydrolyzed whey protein formula for reducing the risk for atopic dermatitis in infants (91657, 91658, 91659, 91660, 91661).\nless\nAtopic disease. Consuming casein peptide as part of formula during the first 4 months of life reduces the risk of atopic disease in infants with a family history of atopy. The benefits of casein peptide in infants without a family history of atopy is unclear.\nClinical research in infants with a family history of atopy shows that taking a casein peptide-based formula (Nutramigen, Mead Johnson) during the first 4 months of life, or after weaning from breastmilk, reduces the risk for atopic manifestations during the first 12-18 months of life by 39% to 44% when compared with cow's milk formula (91656, 91658). This benefit persists over time, with a 20% reduced risk for developing atopic disease at 6 years of age when compared to cow's milk formula (91660). However, it may not be beneficial in children without a family history of atopy. One large, ancillary clinical study in children at increased risk for development of type 1 diabetes, but not specifically at risk for atopy, shows that using an extensively hydrolyzed casein peptide formula (Nutramigen, Mead Johnson) in infancy for up to 6-8 months does not prevent persistent asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis development when compared with using a conventional formula containing 80% intact cow's milk protein and 20% hydrolyzed milk protein (Enfamil, Mead Johnson). The validity of these findings is limited by the patient population and the unclear duration of follow up (106564).\nless\nFood allergies. Consuming casein peptide formulas is a safe alternative to cow's milk in children with cow's milk allergy.\nClinical research shows that specific casein peptide formulas are a safe and well-tolerated alternative for children with documented allergy to cow's milk. Evaluated formulas include Alimentum (Abbot Laboratories), Damira 2000 (Nutrition & Sante S.L.), Frisolac Allergycare (Friesland Nutrition), and Nutramigen (Mead Johnson) (91663, 91664, 91665, 111439). A cost-effective analysis in children with cow's milk allergy also suggests that using casein peptide-based formula is cost-effective dominant and reduces other allergic manifestations when compared with soy-based formula (111438).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nColic. Clinical research shows that consuming casein peptides as part of formula reduces crying, short-term, in infants with colic.\nClinical research in infants with colic shows that replacing cow's milk formula with a specific casein peptide formula (Nutramigen, Mead Johnson) significantly reduces crying and colic when compared with cow's milk formula. However, this effect appears to diminish after more than four days of use (91262). Preliminary clinical research shows that consuming specific casein peptide formulas (Alimentum, Abbot Laboratories; Nutramigen, Mead Johnson) for 7 days reduces daily crying time by up to 5 hours and reduces crying intensity when compared with baseline in infants with colic (91264). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetes. Consuming casein peptides with carbohydrates may be beneficial for reducing postprandial glucose and insulin levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. Casein peptides have also been evaluated for the prevention of type 1 diabetes in infants, with inconclusive results.\nIn adults with type 2 diabetes, casein protein may improve postprandial glucose levels. Most clinical research shows that consuming casein peptides in conjunction with a carbohydrate bolus increases postprandial insulin response by 26% to 300% and reduces postprandial glucose levels by 5% to 28% when compared with consuming carbohydrates alone (91276, 91295, 91297, 91299). These effects seem to persist with casein peptide doses as low as 12 grams daily, but not 6 grams daily (91300). Preliminary clinical research also shows that adding leucine 5 grams or 0.1 grams/kg to casein peptides increases postprandial insulin levels by 52% to 200%, reduces postprandial glucose levels by 5% to 12%, and improves 24-hour glucose levels by 11% when compared with consuming carbohydrates alone (91296, 91297). However, some preliminary clinical research shows that consuming casein peptides 0.4 grams/kg with each meal for one day does not improve glycemic control (91298). These differing outcomes might be related to the forms of carbohydrates used, which include carbohydrate boluses and carbohydrate-containing meals. Additionally, the evidence for the effects of intact casein protein, as opposed to casein peptides, on postprandial insulin and glucose levels is conflicting (91276, 91299).\n\nClinical research in infants 6-8 months of age who are genetically predisposed to type 1 diabetes shows that administering a specific casein peptide-based formula (Nutramigen, Mead Johnson) in place of breastmilk decreases the development of one or more diabetes-associated auto-antibodies when compared with cow's milk formula. However, there was no difference in type 1 diabetes incidence after 10 years. This study was not powered to detect a difference in this outcome (91675).\nless\nHypertension. The casein peptides isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP) and valine-proline-proline (VPP), sometimes referred to as lactotripeptides, can modestly reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Lower doses given for shorter durations seem to produce greater effects, and the effects may be more pronounced in Japanese patients than in European patients.\nThe most comprehensive meta-analysis to-date in patients with hypertension shows that taking casein peptides reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 3 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 1.5 mmHg. The average dose of casein peptides was 10.5 mg daily, including IPP 5.2 mg and VPP 5.3 mg daily, for about 8 weeks. However, there may be an inverse dose-response relationship; daily doses of casein peptides of 10 mg or less, lasting for 8 weeks or less, reduced blood pressure to a greater degree when compared with higher doses given for longer durations. Furthermore, casein peptides produced by fermentation resulted in modestly greater blood pressure reduction when compared with casein peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis (103765). Patient ethnicity may also play a role in the magnitude of effect. Other meta-analyses show a 1-6 mmHg reduction in SBP and 0.6-1.5 mmHg reduction in DBP when compared with control (103762, 103763, 103765, 111437). A small clinical study in healthy Japanese males and postmenopausal adults with prehypertension shows that supplementation with casein peptides IPP 2 mg and VPP 1.4 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces home-monitored 7-day mean DBP, but not SBP, by 0.9 mmHg, compared with an increase of 1.2 mmHg in those receiving placebo (106565). Although findings are positive overall, the validity of the above meta-analysis, as well as older or less comprehensive analyses, is limited by the poor reporting and methodology of the included studies (103763, 103765, 103770, 103772).\n\nSome limited research in patients with metabolic syndrome shows conflicting blood pressure lowering effects. A small clinical study shows that taking IPP/VPP (Calpis Co., Ltd.) 10.2 mg in the morning before breakfast daily for 4 weeks lowers 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg, but not diastolic blood pressure, when compared with placebo (103764). However, another study shows that taking casein peptides 5-25 mg daily with plant sterols 2 grams daily orally for 12 weeks does not reduce blood pressure when compared with placebo (103767). Notably, this study was not adequately powered to detect small changes in blood pressure.\nless\nNeonatal jaundice. Clinical research suggests that consuming casein peptide reduces the risk of jaundice in neonates.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that feeding newborns a specific casein peptide formula (Nutramigen, Mead Johnson) for 3 weeks reduces the risk of jaundice when compared with whey-predominant formula (91642) or human milk (91642, 91651). Other preliminary clinical research in breastfed newborns shows that taking 5 mL of casein peptide formula, created by enzymatic hydrolysis, 6 times daily for 7 days decreases transcutaneous bilirubin levels when compared with breastfeeding alone (91643).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAsthma. Consuming casein peptide does not appear to reduce the risk of asthma in infants.\nMost clinical research shows that feeding infants a casein peptide-based formula (Nutramigen or Progestimil, Mead Johnson), with or without breastmilk for 4 months, does not reduce the risk for asthma in the first 4 months to 6 years of life in children with a family history of atopy (91655, 91659, 91660). However, one preliminary clinical study shows that feeding infants Nutramigen beginning at about 3.8 months of age decreases wheezing by 61% compared to cow's milk formula; the incidence of asthma was not evaluated (91656).\nless\nInfant development. Consuming casein peptide does not appear to affect growth or development in healthy infants, or in premature or low-birth weight infants.\nMost clinical research shows that using casein peptide-predominant formula for 6 weeks to 6 months in premature, low-birth weight, or healthy infants does not affect growth when compared with breast milk, whey protein-based formula, rice hydrolysate formula, cow's milk formula, or amino acid-based formula (86085, 91644, 91672, 91673). Additionally, feeding infants a specific casein peptide formula (Nutramigen, Mead Johnson) for 4 months does not affect growth at 6 or 10 years when compared with whey protein-based formula, cow's milk formula, or breast milk (86085, 91644). However, clinical research suggests that a casein peptide-based formula might be beneficial in infants with cow's milk allergy. One study in this population shows that casein peptide-based formula significantly increases growth from 6-12 months of age when compared with soy-based formula (91672).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. It is unclear if oral casein peptides are beneficial in patients with acne.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with moderate to severe acne shows that taking a specific casein peptide (Lactium) 150 mg orally daily for 84 days does not reduce acne lesion count when compared with control. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (111436).\nless\nAging skin. It is unclear if oral casein peptides are beneficial in patients with aging skin.\nA small clinical study in healthy, normotensive older Japanese adults shows that taking casein peptides isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP) and valine-proline-proline (VPP) orally once daily for 48 weeks reduces facial pigmentation area by about 15%, compared with an increase of about 6% in patients taking placebo (106563).\nless\nAnxiety. Although there has been interest in using oral casein peptides for anxiety, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of casein peptides for this purpose.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral casein peptides are beneficial for athletic performance.\nPreliminary clinical research in overweight male police officers shows that taking casein peptides 1.5 grams/kg orally daily in two divided doses for 12 weeks, in conjunction with resistance training, decreases body fat percentage by 3%, increases lean body mass by 2 kg, and improves chest, shoulder, and leg press strength by around 30% when compared with whey protein (85648).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral casein peptides for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of casein peptides for this purpose.\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral casein peptides are beneficial in patients with diarrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research in male children with persistent diarrhea shows that consuming a casein peptide-based diet during hospitalization is less effective for reducing stool output than a yogurt-based diet (91648).\nless\nEpilepsy. Although there has been interest in using oral casein peptides for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of casein peptides for this purpose.\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral casein peptides are beneficial in patients with exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nPreliminary clinical research in male cyclists shows that drinking 200 mL of a carbohydrate beverage containing 1.8% casein peptides every 5 km followed by 500 mL after cycling completion reduces exercise-induced muscle soreness and improves late-exercise time-trial performance when compared with drinking a carbohydrate beverage alone (91256).\nless\nFatigue. Although there has been interest in using oral casein peptides for fatigue, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of casein peptides for this purpose.\nHyperlipidemia. Low quality research suggests that oral casein peptides are not beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of randomized trials in subjects with and without hyperlipidemia shows that using casein peptide-based diets for 1-48 weeks does not improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with control (111437).\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral casein peptides are beneficial in patients with insomnia.\nA small clinical study in Korean patients with poor sleep quality shows that taking a specific product (Lactium, Ingredia) containing bovine alpha-s1 casein peptides 300 mg one hour before bedtime for 4 weeks modestly improves sleep efficiency based on subjective reports and actigraphy measures when compared with placebo (103774).\n\nCasein peptides have also been studied as part of combination products. A small clinical study in adults with insomnia or disturbed sleep patterns shows that a specific product (RLX2; LiveLife Biosciences AG) containing a specific casein peptide, alpha-s1-casein tryptic hydrolysate, 150 mg, and L-theanine 50 mg, taken one hour before bedtime for 4 weeks, increases sleep duration by 45 minutes and improves habitual sleep efficiency and daytime dysfunction when compared with baseline. However, it does not affect blood pressure, heart rate, or cortisol levels (108556). It is unclear if these effects are due to L-theanine, alpha-s1-casein tryptic hydrolysate, or the combination.\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral casein peptides are beneficial for physical performance.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy older males shows that taking casein peptides 10 grams before and after resistance training for 8 weeks does not improve strength or body composition when compared with placebo (91255).\nless\nStress. Although there has been interest in using oral casein peptides for stress, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of casein peptides for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate casein peptides for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nCasein peptides have been used in doses of up to 10.5 mg for 21-48 weeks (106563, 103763, 103764, 103765, 103770, 103772, 106565). Higher doses of up to 12-17.6 grams have been used as short-term, one-time, doses (91256, 91299, 91300). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nSpecific casein peptide formulas (Nutramigen or Progestimil, Mead Johnson) have been used in neonates and infants for up to 18 months (91655, 91656, 91658, 91659, 91660, 91663, 91664, 91665). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nCasein peptides are often listed on the label as casein hydrolysate, hydrolyzed casein protein, or extensively hydrolyzed casein protein. Casein peptides are produced by enzymatically breaking down casein protein to smaller amino acid chains, which enhances absorption (91257). However, casein peptides are reported to have an unpalatable flavor (91630, 91631, 91632). One clinical trial in children with cow's milk allergy suggests that casein peptides have poor taste, smell, and texture when compared to soy protein, soy protein hydrolysate, rice protein hydrolysate, whey protein hydrolysate, and mixed protein hydrolysate (91630).\n\nCasein peptide-based infant formulas that have been studied include Alimentum (Abbott Laboratories) (91264, 91663, 91674), Damira 2000 (Nutrition & Sante S.L.)

Patients with milk allergy are allergic to certain proteins contained in milk. Certain fragments of milk proteins, such as casein peptides, might also be allergenic in these patients (13047, 13051). However, some specific casein peptide formulas such as Alimentum (Abbot Laboratories), Damira 2000 (Nutrition & Sante S.L.), Frisolac Allergycare (Friesland Nutrition), and Nutramigen (Mead Johnson) have been safely used in infants with milk allergy (91663, 91664, 91665).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCasein peptides are absorbed at a faster rate than intact casein protein (91257).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCasein peptides are produced from the hydrolysis of casein protein, the primary protein in milk. When casein protein is consumed, proteolytic digestive enzymes hydrolyze casein into casein peptides in the gastrointestinal tract (13046). Casein peptides may also be produced via hydrolysis in a laboratory.\nAnalgesic effects\nSome casein peptides might have opioid receptor stimulating properties (13052).\nAnti-diabetes effects\nThere is interest in casein peptides for improving glycemic control in diabetes. Some researchers suggest that casein peptides may protect against beta-cell autoimmunity through gut flora modification, avoidance of intact bovine insulin, decreased gut permeability, and/or stimulation of regulatory T cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (91292).\nAntiallergy effects\nIntolerance to cow's milk proteins can develop during the neonatal period as infants are exposed to the dietary antigens contained in cow's milk (91655). Clinical research shows that eliminating cow's milk-based formula and using casein peptide-based formulas reduces the risk for atopic manifestations in infants and children (91655, 91656, 91658, 91659, 91660).\nCardiovascular effects\nA clinical study shows that improvements in facial pigmentation area in those taking the casein peptides isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP) and valine-proline-proline (VPP) is associated with reductions in the skin accumulation of advanced glycation end products, which have been shown to play a crucial role in the development of atherosclerosis. Casein peptides also reduce triglyceride levels, which has been shown to be independently associated with reductions in facial pigmentation area (106563).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using casein peptides for acne. Preliminary clinical research in adults with moderate to severe acne shows that taking casein peptides 150 mg orally daily for 84 days reduces serum cortisol levels and improves stress scores when compared with control (111436).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn animal research, casein peptides stimulate various intestinal secretions. In isolated rat jejunum, casein peptides stimulate mucin and mucus production (13049). Casein peptides also seem to stimulate cholecystokinin secretion from rat intestinal cells (13050). There is also interest in whether casein peptides or intact casein protein have different effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Gastric emptying rates do not seem to differ in individuals taking casein peptides or intact casein protein (103773). However, in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders, casein peptides in the diet might reduce gastrointestinal complaints like stomach pain and heartburn when compared with consuming intact casein (103775).\nHypotensive effects\nSome casein peptides have demonstrated blood pressure lowering effects in clinical research. Sour milk contains two tri-peptides, valine-proline-proline (VPP) and isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP), which have a blood pressure lowering effect (103763, 103765, 103770, 103772). These peptides are thought to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) similarly to the ACE inhibitor antihypertensive drug class (13044, 13046, 13048). In animals, the casein peptides with ACE inhibitory activity seem to be absorbed intact, without digestive degradation (13052).\nImmunologic effects\nSome casein peptides affect immune function. Casein peptides appear to increase or decrease proliferation of lymphocytes, increase antibody formation, increase phagocytosis, and increase natural killer cell activity (13046).\nInfantile colic\nWhile the exact cause of infantile colic is unclear, some researchers suggest that colic-associated symptoms might be due to adverse reactions to milk. Some clinical research shows that feeding casein peptide formulas to infants with colic reduces crying and colic symptoms (91262, 91264).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in whether casein peptides can alter thermoregulatory responses in the body. A small clinical study in healthy patients shows that taking a single dose of casein peptides 5 grams, 30 minutes before cycling in experimentally-induced heated conditions, increased sweating on the chest, but not on other body areas, and increased skin temperature, but not body temperature, when compared with placebo (103771).\nNeonatal jaundice\nCasein peptides have been shown to contain a beta-glucuronidase inhibitor (91652). Beta-glucuronidase enhances the intestinal absorption of bilirubin (91653). Inhibiting this enzyme increases the elimination of bilirubin, reducing the risk for jaundice. Clinical research shows that feeding infants casein peptide formula decreases jaundice and bilirubin levels when compared to human milk (91642, 91643, 91651)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Casein protein, which gives milk its white color, is the major protein source found in milk. Dairy milk consists of around 80% casein protein and 20% whey protein (91633). Casein protein is considered a complete protein, meaning it contains all of the essential amino acids, including the branched chain amino acids (91679). In addition to milk, casein protein is present in yogurt and cheese. It is also included in infant formulas and in a variety of dietary supplements (91678).\n\nCasein protein is different than casein peptides, also called hydrolyzed casein, which are produced by breaking down intact casein protein into individual peptides (103773).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Casein protein has been safely used in clinical trials lasting up to 12 months (16728, 85932, 91251, 91253, 91255, 91266, 91267, 91268, 91286, 91294)(91641).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Casein protein formulas have been safely used in healthy, premature, and very low birth weight infants (91646, 91667).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using in amounts greater than those found in foods.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, casein protein is well tolerated in adults and seems to be well tolerated in infants. Side effects reported in clinical trials did not occur more commonly than placebo (85932, 91251, 91266, 91286, 91294, 91299, 91641, 91646, 91667). Some of these reported side effects include diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, and delayed gastric emptying (91640, 91667). In preterm infants, casein protein has been associated with an increased risk for metabolic acidosis (91667, 91671). Rarely, casein protein has been reported to cause allergic reaction (91629).\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, casein protein-based enteral nutrition has been reported to cause diarrhea and vomiting in adults (91640). Casein protein-predominant formula has been reported to cause constipation in infants (91667). Casein protein-based formula can delay gastric emptying when compared with whey protein-based formula (86084, 86103).\nless\nImmunologic\nRarely, allergic reaction to casein protein has been reported. Symptoms include skin reactions, difficulty breathing, gastrointestinal distress, and anaphylaxis (91629). At one time, casein protein was thought to be the major allergenic and antigenic protein in cow's milk (91627). However, it is now known that no specific protein or peptide in cow's milk is primarily responsible for cow's milk allergy; casein protein is used as a common alternative to cow's milk formula (91628).\nless\nOther\nOrally, casein protein-predominant formula has been associated with an increased risk for metabolic acidosis in preterm infants when compared to using humanized whey protein-predominant or special low birth weight formulas (91671).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nInfant development. Most clinical research shows that using casein protein-predominant formula for 6 weeks to 6 months in premature, low-birth weight, or healthy infants does not affect growth when compared with breast milk, whey protein-based formula, rice hydrolysate formula, cow's milk formula, or amino acid-based formula (91645, 91668, 91669, 91670). However, other clinical research in healthy, moderately premature, or very low birth weight infants shows that whey protein-based formula is superior to casein protein-based formula for increasing growth (91666, 91667, 91671).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlcohol-related liver disease. Preliminary clinical research in adults with alcohol-related liver disease shows that a specific casein protein-based supplement (Isocal HCN, Mead Johnson), dosed as 1.5 grams/kg of ideal body weight daily, administered via enteral feeding tube for 28 days, improves encephalopathy scores by over 50% when compared with baseline. Taking the casein protein-based formula also improved total caloric intake and plasma markers of liver disease when compared with control (91266). Additional clinical research in adults with alcohol-related liver disease shows that taking a specific casein-based enteral formula (ADN, Laboratorios Davis) providing 34 grams of protein daily for one year reduces hospitalization rate by approximately 50% and reduces the risk for infection when compared with control. However, there was no effect on mortality or progression of liver failure (91268).\nAthletic performance. The clinical evidence for the benefits of casein protein on athletic performance is conflicting. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking casein protein alone or in combination with whey protein and other sports supplements for 4-12 weeks, in conjunction with resistance training, does not improve strength or body composition when compared with placebo in obese women or young men (91252, 91254, 91280, 111440). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking casein protein, with or without whey protein, improves strength and athletic performance in a variety of individuals, including collegiate female basketball players, obese sedentary women, and professional male soccer players (85821, 91253, 91280, 91641).\nCasein protein has also been compared with other popular athletic performance supplements. When compared with whey protein, most clinical research shows that casein protein and whey protein are equally effective for improving strength and athletic performance (91253, 91280, 91641, 103776). Conversely, some clinical research shows that whey protein is superior to casein protein for improving strength and body composition in recreational bodybuilders (16728). Clinical research comparing casein protein to creatine daily after exercise shows that both supplement regimens have similar effects on strength in untrained men; however, creatine increases body mass by an additional 2.4 kg when compared with casein protein (91251).\n\nThe reasons for these conflicting outcomes are not clear. Variable outcomes may be related to the population studied, the exercise regimen used, and the dietary advice provided to study participants. Although some have hypothesized that the timing of casein protein intake with respect to resistance training and/or sleep might alter effectiveness (111440), clinical research does not support this theory. Taking casein protein either before or after exercise does not appear to alter its effect on athletic performance (86071, 91260).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Muscle wasting is a common complication in patients with COPD. Preliminary clinical research in adults with COPD shows that taking casein protein 29.5 grams two hours prior to exercise increases protein synthesis when compared with whey protein (91263). Despite these findings, clinical research in adults with COPD shows that taking casein protein 20 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve lung or muscle function when compared with baseline or whey protein. Furthermore, taking casein protein in conjunction with exercise training for 8 weeks is less effective than whey protein for improving endurance and fatigue in patients with COPD (86025).\nCirrhosis. Preliminary clinical research in adults with stable cirrhosis who are unable to maintain adequate protein intake shows that taking a casein protein-based supplement (Ensure, Ross Laboratories) 20-60 grams daily for 4-6 days improves mental status when compared with taking a branched-chain amino acid supplement (91267).\nDiabetes. A clinical study in men with diabetes shows that drinking a beverage containing carbohydrates and casein protein 0.3 g/kg as a single dose increases plasma insulin levels and tends to lower levels of plasma glucose when compared with placebo. However, there was no difference between beverages containing intact casein protein or casein peptides (91276). Furthermore, a small clinical study in patients with diabetes shows that taking sodium caseinate (Saneigien) 15 grams by mouth as a single dose does not lower postprandial blood glucose, but seems to increase postprandial insulin levels by 36% and glucagon levels by about 14%, when compared with placebo (91299).\nDiarrhea. Preliminary clinical research in infants with prolonged dehydrating gastroenteritis shows that consuming formula containing casein protein, soy protein, or whey protein as 160 mL/kg daily reduces stool weight when compared with cow's milk formula (91646).\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Preliminary clinical research in cyclists shows that drinking 1000 mL of a supplement containing 5% casein protein and 2% carbohydrates does not improve time trial performance when compared with supplements containing either 2% carbohydrates and 5% whey protein, or 7% carbohydrates and no protein (86303). Additionally, preliminary clinical research in athletes performing intensive resistance training shows that taking a specific protein supplement (New Whey Liquid Protein, IDS Sports), containing casein protein, whey protein, collagen protein, and branched chain amino acids, 42 grams before and after exercise, does not reduce muscle soreness when compared with placebo (85945).\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Preliminary clinical research in neurologically impaired children with GERD shows that taking a specific casein protein formula (Osmolite, Ross Laboratories) is less effective than taking a specific whey protein formula (Peptamen, Clintec Nutrition) for reducing GERD episode frequency and duration. However, in infants with GERD, the effects of casein protein and whey protein appear to be similar (86231).\nHepatic encephalopathy. Preliminary clinical research in adults with chronic hepatic encephalopathy shows that taking casein protein daily for 3 months is less effective than branched-chain amino acid therapy for improving symptoms of encephalopathy. Replacement of casein protein with branched-chain amino acid therapy after these 3 months led to improvements in encephalopathy symptoms (690).\nHepatitis C. Preliminary clinical research in adults with chronic hepatitis C infection shows that taking casein protein 32 grams daily for 12 weeks improves health-related quality of life when compared with baseline. This improvement is similar to consuming soy protein 32 grams daily (91270).\nHyperlipidemia. Clinical research assessing the effects of casein protein on blood lipids is conflicting. Casein protein is commonly used as a control treatment in clinical trials assessing other protein sources, including soy, barley, whey, and lupin. The majority of these studies show that casein protein has no effect on lipid levels in healthy and hyperlipidemic adults (842, 2294, 6412, 8530, 8963, 75149, 75219, 75242, 75276, 75580)(91274, 75240, 75512, 75540, 75545, 75615, 86011, 91273, 91279, 91281). However, some small preliminary clinical studies show that taking casein protein 35-40 grams daily for 6-12 weeks improves total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with baseline in healthy and hyperlipidemic patients (8963, 75149, 91281). Also, casein protein seems to improve lipoprotein(a) levels, with some clinical studies showing lipoprotein(a) reductions of more than 50% with casein protein when compared with soy protein (75149, 75219).\nHypertension. The effects of casein protein on blood pressure are unclear. Clinical research in overweight and obese adults shows that taking casein protein 54 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces diastolic blood pressure, but not systolic blood pressure, by 3% when compared with a control diet (85981). Preliminary clinical research in obese, sedentary women shows that taking casein protein 30 grams daily, in conjunction with moderate intensity exercise for 4 weeks, reduces systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, by 7 mmHg compared with a control diet and moderate intensity exercise (91280).\nObesity. Most clinical research shows that supplementation with casein protein does not reduce body weight or appetite when compared to control in overweight and obese patients (86011, 86105, 91286). However, some clinical research in overweight patients shows that consumption of a liquid snack containing 30 grams of casein or whey protein extends the duration of satiety compared with a carbohydrate snack (91284). Additionally, some research in obese patients shows that taking casein protein or whey protein 25 grams twice daily for 12 weeks improves weight maintenance after weight loss when compared with control (85932). Also, while some research suggests that whey protein is superior to casein protein for appetite suppression (91286), most clinical research shows that casein protein, whey protein, and soy protein have similar effects on weight loss and satiety (86011, 91272, 91284, 91294).\nPreliminary clinical research in overweight children shows that drinking 1000 mL of a milk drink containing 35 grams of casein protein in place of water daily for 12 weeks increases body mass index when compared with water (86144).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of casein protein for these uses.",

Other products contain casein peptides, which are produced from hydrolysis of intact casein protein and are often labelled as casein hydrolysate, hydrolyzed casein protein, or extensively hydrolyzed casein protein. These products are thought to enhance absorption. Casein peptides have different bioavailability, biological activity, and tolerability, and are reviewed separately from casein protein (91257, 91630, 91632).\n\nCasein protein-based enteral feeding supplements that have been studied include ADN (Laboratorios Davis) (91268), Ensure (Ross Laboratories) (91267), Isocal HCN (Mead Johnson) (91266), Osmolite (Ross Laboratories) (86231), and Pediasure (Abbott Australasia) (86103).",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIntact casein protein micelles form a clot or gel in the stomach upon introduction to its acidic environment, resulting in the slow release of amino acids throughout the body (86265). Some research shows that amino acids continue to be released into the bloodstream up to 7 hours after consumption of casein protein (91278). For these reasons, casein protein is often referred to as a \"slow\" protein, while whey and soy protein are considered \"fast\" proteins (91679). Casein peptides are absorbed at a faster rate than intact casein protein (91257).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCasein protein is the major protein found in cow's milk. It is considered a complete protein, as it contains all of the essential amino acids (91679). Casein protein occurs naturally as micelles, each of which are made up of thousands of individual casein molecules (91261, 91633).\nAnti-diabetes effects\nSome clinical research shows that beta-cell autoimmunity and the development of type 1 diabetes might be influenced by introduction of complex dietary proteins early in life (91676, 91677). In adults with type 2 diabetes, clinical and in vivo evidence show that taking casein protein along with carbohydrates stimulates insulin secretion, resulting in decreased postprandial glucose concentrations (86129, 91295, 91296, 91297, 91299, 91626, 91678). Other clinical research in adults with pre-diabetes shows that taking casein protein 16.5 grams orally once at the same time as glucose reduces glucose-dependent serum lipid changes when compared with control (111441).\nAntiallergy effects\nIntolerance to cow's milk proteins can develop during the neonatal period as infants are exposed to the dietary antigens contained in cow's milk (91655). Clinical research shows that eliminating cow's milk-based formula and using casein peptide-based formulas reduces the risk for atopic manifestations in infants and children (91655, 91656, 91658, 91659, 91660). It is unclear if using formulas containing intact casein protein are beneficial for reducing atopy.\nAthletic effects\nThere is interest in using casein to improve athletic performance, although clinical research shows conflicting results (85821, 91252, 91253, 91254, 91280, 91641, 111440). Clinical research shows that taking casein protein 40-45 grams orally after resistance training seems to increase muscle protein synthesis, while taking casein protein 20 grams does not seem to produce this effect (91258, 103777, 111442). This is believed to explain the improvements in strength, body composition, and exercise performance reported in some clinical trials evaluating patients taking casein protein (85821, 85945, 91251). Some clinical research shows that casein protein and whey protein increase muscle protein synthesis to similar degrees (85764, 86052, 86071, 86149), while other research suggests that whey protein significantly increases muscle protein synthesis compared to casein protein (18084, 68822, 86067). This may be explained in part by the fact that whey protein is rapidly absorbed, with amino acid levels appearing in the plasma very quickly post-ingestion. Casein protein, on the other hand, is absorbed more slowly, leading to sustained increases in amino acid concentrations in the plasma over a longer period of time (91253).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in untrained females also shows that taking casein protein 25 grams orally once before a running exercise improves respiratory exchange ratio and resting energy expenditure when compared with placebo (111443).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome preliminary clinical research in humans shows that taking casein protein 30-54 grams daily for 4-12 weeks can modestly improve blood pressure in adults (85981, 91280). However, the best evidence for blood pressure reduction seems to be with specific casein peptides, sometimes called lactotripeptides (103763, 103765, 103770, 103772).\nDiarrhea\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using a casein protein-containing formula reduces stool weight in infants with prolonged dehydrating gastroenteritis. It is purported that persistent diarrhea in infants may be caused by lactose intolerance or cow's milk protein intolerance. Therefore, substituting lactose- or cow's milk-containing formulas with casein protein-based formula may avoid the adverse effects associated with intolerance to these formulas (91646).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in whether intact casein protein has a different effect on the gastrointestinal tract than casein peptides. Gastric emptying rates do not seem to differ in individuals taking casein peptides or intact casein protein (103773). However, in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders, casein peptides in the diet might reduce gastrointestinal complaints like stomach pain and heartburn when compared with consuming intact casein (103775).\nHepatic effects\nPatients with liver disease often suffer from malnutrition (91266, 91268). Providing adequate nutritional supplementation in these patients is believed to attenuate the progression of liver disease and its associated symptoms. Clinical research has shown beneficial effects of casein protein-based supplements in patients with alcohol-related liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatitis C (91266, 91267, 91268, 91270).\nLipid effects\nThe majority of clinical research shows that casein protein does not reduce lipid levels in healthy or hyperlipidemic adults (8963, 75149, 75580, 91279, 91281). However, a small number of studies have shown benefit. The mechanism by which casein protein affects blood lipids is unclear; however, some researchers suggest that the insulinotropic effects of casein protein may interfere with lipid metabolism (91277, 91282, 91626).\nSatiety\nConsumption of a high protein diet has been shown to reduce appetite and energy intake in some patients (85932, 91284, 91286). Because casein protein is more slowly digested and absorbed compared to whey protein, it is thought that casein might improve satiety post-consumption (91293). However, studies in both healthy and overweight patients assessing the satiating effects of casein protein have reported inconsistent results when compared with whey protein, other dietary proteins, and placebo (85715, 85948, 86016, 86058, 86100, 86105, 91272, 91284, 91285, 91286, 91293, 91639)."

Cashew nuts are commonly eaten as food. Although most tree nuts are included in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized health claim related to a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, cashew is excluded due to its high levels of stearic acid, a saturated fat (40151, 101083, 101085, 101087, 113418).",

However, these side effects are rare.\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, consumption of large amounts of cashew nuts (approximately 200 grams daily for over 6 months) is thought to be responsible for the development of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in a 59-year-old adult who consumed large amounts of cashew for its supposed weight loss effects. Cashew nut oil contains L-tryptophan, and dietary supplements containing L-tryptophan historically have been associated with cases of EMS (106927).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, there are numerous reports of cashew nut allergy. Symptoms have included asthma, hives, swelling, wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms, and shortness of breath (40106, 40109, 40123, 40131, 40135, 101082, 101088, 101090).\n\nTopically, contact with cashew can lead to redness and nodule and blister formation. Alkyl phenols contained in the cashew nut shell are strong skin irritants, similar to alkyl phenols found in poison ivy, poison oak, mango, and ginkgo. Roasted cashew nuts are free of the alkyl phenols (18, 40116, 40142, 40149, 40153, 40157).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, adverse effects possibly or probably related to cashew nuts have included cases of worsened arthritis and gout (101085).

However, these side effects are rare.\nless\nRenal\nOrally, very large intakes of the cashew nut or pseudofruit have resulted in oxalate nephropathy in case reports (101086, 101087, 106926). Large amounts of cashew nuts, such as a single intake of 480 grams or consumption of up to 150 grams daily for 4 months, is thought to be responsible for reports of nephropathy related to calcium oxalate crystals in some older adults (101086, 106926). In one such case, insufficient dietary calcium intake was thought to play a role in the promotion of the oxalate crystals (101086). In another case report of a 59-year-old adult, the high vitamin C content of the cashew pseudofruit was thought to be responsible for the development of oxalate nephropathy and severe acute tubular necrosis. The patient reported eating five cashew pseudofruits daily, as well as drinking approximately 1000 mL daily of juice made from the fruit. He did not consume the nuts (101087).\nless\nOther\nOrally, adverse effects possibly or probably related to cashew nuts have included weight gain (101085).\nless",

It is unclear if consuming cashew nuts orally is beneficial for the prevention of CVD.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults shows that eating cashew nuts 42 grams daily for 4 weeks does not affect primary risk factors for CVD, including blood lipids, blood pressure, blood glucose, or clotting factors, when compared with placebo (101083).\nless\nDiabetes. Small clinical studies have found no benefit on glycemic measures in people with diabetes who consume cashew nuts.\nClinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that consuming cashew nuts 30 grams daily for 12 weeks in addition to a standard diabetic diet reduces systolic blood pressure and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 1.9-fold and 16-fold more, respectively, than the diet alone. However, it does not improve body weight, other blood lipid levels, diastolic blood pressure, or glycemic measures (101084). Several small meta-analyses of clinical studies, mostly in patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, show that cashew consumption for 4-12 weeks modestly improves systolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg, but has no effect on diastolic blood pressure, body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, or glycemic measures, when compared with control (106922, 106924).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Consuming cashew nuts orally may improve some lipid levels in adults with mildly to moderately elevated lipid levels.\nOne small clinical trial in individuals with mildly to moderately elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol shows that eating cashew nuts providing approximately 11% of total calories daily for 4 weeks reduces levels of LDL cholesterol by 5%, compared to a slight increase in LDL levels when eating approximately the same amount of low-fat baked potato chips. However, it does not affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels (101085). Conversely, a meta-analysis of 38 mostly low-quality studies shows that consuming cashew nuts modestly increases levels of HDL cholesterol when compared with not consuming any nuts (113419).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if consuming cashew nuts orally improves cardiometabolic parameters in adults with metabolic syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that consuming a diet in which 20% of energy is derived from cashew nuts for 8 weeks does not improve body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, or blood lipids, but does increase fasting glucose levels, when compared with baseline (40133). A small clinical study of females with overweight or obesity, as well as other cardiometabolic risk factors, shows that following a 500 calorie-per-day diet that incorporates 30 grams of cashew nuts and 15 grams of Brazil nuts daily for 8 weeks reduces total body fat and increases lean mass percentage when compared with the energy-restricted diet alone. Levels of lipids, glucose, and blood pressure improved from baseline in both groups; however, there were no between-group differences (113418).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if consuming cashew nuts orally reduces appetite or weight in adults or adolescents with obesity.\nA small clinical study in adults with overweight and obesity shows that consumption of a shake containing cashew nuts 30 grams and Brazil nuts 15 grams in the morning following an overnight fast has no effect on subjective appetite, food intake at lunch, or energy intake throughout the day when compared with an isocaloric control shake without nuts (106925).\n\nCashews have also been evaluated in adolescents. A small, unblinded study in Brazilian students with obesity between the ages of 10-14 shows that consuming 30 grams of roasted cashew nuts daily for 12 weeks, in addition to receiving nutrition education, modestly reduces waist circumference, but not total or lean body mass, when compared with nutrition education alone (115920).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate cashew for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nConsumption of cashew increases levels of oleic acid in the plasma (101084).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of cashew is the nut (18). Cashew nuts are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, including oleic and linoleic acids, amino acids, dietary fiber, vitamins, magnesium, and potassium (101084, 113420). Flour ground from cashew nuts is comprised of 34% carbohydrates, 37% fats, 21% proteins, and 3.6% fiber (115921). The nuts also contain flavonols, including catechins, epicatechins, and quercetin; and phenolic acids, including anacardic and coumaric acids (113420).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn mouse models of inflammation, cashew nuts attenuate inflammation-induced changes in neutrophil infiltration, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels, as well as macroscopic and histologic changes in the affected tissues (106929, 106930, 113247). In females with overweight or obesity, as well as other cardiometabolic risk factors, consuming a single drink containing cashew nuts 15 grams and Brazil nuts 30 grams reduces levels of the endothelial inflammation marker, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (113418).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, cashew nut extract is effective against bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18, 40107).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn mouse models of inflammation, cashew nuts attenuate inflammation-induced oxidative stress, including changes in malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione activity (106929, 106930). In females with overweight or obesity, as well as other cardiometabolic risk factors, consuming a single drink containing cashew nuts 15 grams and Brazil nuts 30 grams reduces malondialdehyde levels when compared with control, but does not lower other oxidative stress markers (113420).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nIn rats fed a high-fat diet to induce dyslipidemia and anxiety, adding cashew nuts to the diet seems to have an anxiolytic effect. Cashew ingestion also reduced polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels in the brain and the ratio of PUFAs to saturated fatty acids (115921).\nCerebrovascular effects\nA crossover study in healthy older adults shows that consuming a mix of cashew nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, and pistachio nuts, 60 grams daily for 16 weeks, increases cerebral blood flow in the right and left frontal and parietal lobes and prefrontal cortex, and improves carotid artery reactivity, brachial flow-mediated vasodilation, and retinal arteriolar diameter when compared with control. Verbal and visuospatial memory also improved (113416). The effects of cashew nuts alone have not been studied.\nGlycemic effects\nA small clinical study in children aged 2 to 5 years with moderate malnutrition shows that consumption of cashew nut seed flour 12 grams daily modestly improves glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels when compared with control (106921).\nHepatic effects\nIn a rat model of dyslipidemia, consumption of roasted cashew nuts increases liver fat (106931).\nLipid effects\nCashew is of interest for lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. However, evidence in humans is mixed (40133, 101083, 101084, 101085, 106922, 106923). In vitro, cashew extract upregulated the LDL receptor (40117). In dyslipidemic rats, consumption of roasted cashew nuts increases total cholesterol levels, but decreases triglyceride levels and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (106931). In females with overweight or obesity, as well as other cardiometabolic risk factors, consuming a single drink containing cashew nuts 15 grams and Brazil nuts 30 grams does not alter serum lipid levels when compared with control (113420).\nMetabolic effects\nIn an animal model of hyperhomocysteinemia, consuming cashew nuts daily induced anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects but did not reduce homocysteine levels. Possible mechanisms include modulation of the antioxidant nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) and inflammatory nuclear factor NF-kB signaling pathways (113247).\nWeight loss effects\nIn a rat model of dyslipidemia, consumption of roasted cashew nuts reduces visceral fat and increases fecal fat excretion (106931)."

            "Overview": "Cassava is a starchy root vegetable that is an important food staple in tropical and developing countries, particularly during times of drought or famine (90451, 90452). Cassava contains potentially toxic levels of cyanogenic glycosides that can cause serious conditions if not removed during processing (90451). Researchers are working to create a transgenic form of cassava with significantly reduced cyanogenic content (90451).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in food amounts that have been processed appropriately to remove cyanogenic glycosides. Cassava flour that contains no more than 10 ppm of cyanide is considered safe by the World Health Organization (25869, 26585). Grating and crushing are considered to be appropriate processing methods to remove cyanide from bitter or sweet cassava root. Sweet cassava may be processed by boiling, steaming, baking, or frying (25841, 26585). Boiling, steaming, baking, or frying are not considered to be sufficient processing methods to remove cyanide from bitter cassava (26585).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in food amounts that have not been processed appropriately to remove cyanogenic glycosides. Regularly consuming uncooked cassava or cassava that has not been processed appropriately, especially as part of a protein-deficient diet, increases exposure to cyanogenic glycosides (25844). Heap fermentation or sun drying are not considered to be appropriate processing methods for removing cyanide from bitter or sweet cassava root (26585). Boiling, steaming, baking, or frying are not considered to be appropriate processing methods for removing cyanide from bitter cassava (26585).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of using cassava in medicinal amounts.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in food amounts. Cassava is commonly consumed as a food with apparent safety. However, regular cassava consumption by children has been associated with inadequate intake of vitamin A, zinc, and iron (26175). Also, cassava may contain cyanogenic glycosides, and children are at a higher risk of cyanide poisoning from cassava compared to adults (25843).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally as a food in large quantities. Epidemiological research has found that children who eat more than 700 grams of cassava daily may have a higher risk of developing konzo, a paralytic disease, than those who eat less than 150 grams daily (25860).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally as a food, especially in large quantities. Animal research suggests that consuming milled cassava powder as 80% of the diet during the first 15 days of pregnancy can cause teratogenic effects, including intrauterine growth restriction, limb defects, and abnormally small brain (microencephaly) (26171). Also, epidemiological evidence suggests that pregnant women who regularly consume dietary cassava in the form of gari during pregnancy have higher levels of thiocyanate, which has negative effects on fetal birthweight, compared to those who do not consume cassava (26172). ...when applied intravaginally. Inserting 2-3 cm of cassava stalk into the vagina has been used to induce abortion and labor (26174).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in food amounts, especially in large quantities. Excess consumption of cassava during lactation may increase the risk of exposing the infant to thiocyanate, which can negatively affect thyroid function in the infant (26586).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, cassava may cause cyanide poisoning. Cassava, especially the bitter variety, contains cyanogenic glycosides. If not removed during processing, these constituents are converted to cyanogens. Symptoms of cyanide poisoning can include vomiting, nausea, stomach pains, and diarrhea, as well as dizziness, weakness, and headache. (26585). Cassava intake has also been associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism and endemic goiter. This adverse effect is attributed to cyanogens, which can disrupt thyroid hormone production by decreasing iodine absorption (25841, 25843, 25844). The risk of these adverse effects is especially high for patients who consume cassava as part of a protein-deficient diet (25841, 25843, 25844). Consumption of cassava that has not been processed to remove the cyanogens has also been associated with an increased risk of developing paralytic diseases, tropical pancreatitis, and tropical ataxic neuropathy (25844, 25854, 25856, 25859, 25860, 25861, 25863, 25864). Rarely, cassava has been reported to cause allergic reaction (99802, 99806, 99807).\nEndocrine\nOrally, cassava has been associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism and endemic goiter, particularly when consumed after poor processing or along with a protein-deficient diet (25846, 25850, 25852). Cassava, especially the bitter varieties, contains cyanogenic glycosides. If not removed during processing, these constituents are converted to cyanogens, which disrupt thyroid hormone production by decreasing iodine absorption (25841, 25843, 25844). In humans, consuming boiled cassava leaves 200 grams twice daily can decrease serum levels of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) after only 9 days (25847).\n\nThere is also some concern that people who regularly consume cassava may have an increased risk of developing tropical pancreatitis, a form of pancreatitis that is primarily seen in tropical countries. However, this association has not been consistently observed (25854, 25856).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, cassava can cause cyanide poisoning. Cassava, especially the bitter varieties, contains cyanogenic glycosides. If not removed during processing, these constituents are converted to cyanogens. Gastrointestinal symptoms of cyanide poisoning can include vomiting, nausea, stomach pains, and diarrhea (26585).\nless\nImmunologic\nRarely, cases of IgE-mediated allergic reaction have been reported after consumption of cassava. Reactions have included generalized urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress, dry cough, and anaphylaxis. To date, all patients with confirmed cassava allergy also had an existing, confirmed latex allergy. It is hypothesized that cassava allergy results from primary sensitization to latex (99802, 99806, 99807).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, cassava can cause cyanide poisoning. Cassava, especially the bitter variety, contains cyanogenic glycosides. If not removed during processing, these constituents are converted to cyanogens. Neurological symptoms of cyanide poisoning include dizziness, weakness, and headache (26585). Evidence from case-control studies suggests that ingestion of wild or unprocessed cassava is associated with an increased risk of paralytic diseases, including spastic paraparesis, ataxic neuropathy, and konzo. People who consume wild or unprocessed cassava along with a protein-deficient diet seem to be at a particularly increased risk for these effects (25844, 25859, 25860, 25861, 99804). Although konzo is primarily a paralytic disease, children diagnosed with konzo have also demonstrated reduced mental and motor function (99805). Furthermore, children who have not been diagnosed with konzo but who live in a region where konzo is endemic demonstrate impairment in neurocognition and motor proficiency when compared with children in non-endemic regions. This suggests that there may be a subclinical form of the condition that causes neurocognitive complications (99805).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, long-term consumption of wild or unprocessed cassava has been associated with the development of optic neuropathy and tropical ataxic neuropathy, presenting as loss of vision and hearing, particularly in protein-malnourished populations. Both of these conditions are attributed to cassava-induced cyanide overload (25863, 25864, 26585).\nless",

            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nCROSS-ALLERGENICITY\nCassava might cause an allergic reaction in individuals who are sensitive to latex (99802, 99806, 99807).\nless\nIODINE DEFICIENCY\nPopulation research suggests that dietary cassava can increase the risk of goiter in patients with pre-existing iodine deficiency (26173). Also, consuming boiled cassava leaves can decrease iodine absorption in humans (25847). Tell patients with iodine deficiency to avoid consuming cassava, as cassava might worsen this condition.\nless\nPROTEIN DEFICIENCY\nPeople who consume inadequate levels of protein may be more prone to the potentially toxic effects of cassava. Cyanogenic glycosides are naturally present in cassava. If not removed during processing, they are converted to hydrogen cyanide, cyanohydrins, and thiocyanates. These metabolites may cause a number of serious adverse effects, particularly in the presence of protein-deficient diets (25841, 25843, 25844, 26586, 26588). Individuals with low protein intake (low cysteine in particular) are more susceptible to cyanide poisoning, because the detoxification of cyanide requires cysteine as a substrate (26588).\nless\nTHYROID DISEASE\nEvidence from human and animal research suggests that cassava has marked antithyroid effects, particularly when processed poorly or when consumed as part of a protein-deficient diet (25846, 25847, 25848, 25849, 25850, 25851, 25852). Also, clinical research suggests that consuming boiled cassava leaves reduces levels of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine (25847). Theoretically, cassava may alter thyroid function, reduce thyroid hormone levels, and interfere with thyroid hormone replacement therapy in patients with thyroid disease.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "THYROID HORMONES\nCassava might lower levels of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine (25846, 25847, 25848, 25849, 25850, 25851, 25852).\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the toxic effects of cassava.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe glycemic index of cassava is 94, indicating that the carbohydrates in cassava are metabolized quickly during digestion, releasing glucose rapidly into the bloodstream (26398).\nDistribution\nEvidence from in vitro research suggests that the bioaccessibility of beta-carotene in various cultivars of cassava ranges from 30% to 70% after simulated oral, gastric, and small intestinal digestion (25882).\nMetabolism\nLinamarin, a cyanogenic glycoside in cassava, is hydrolyzed in the intestinal tract of humans and animals by microbial flora, releasing cyanide (25879). Also, linamarin inhibits Na+K+ATPase, causing electrolyte imbalance within the cell (25879). It has been calculated that 4% to 23% of the sulfur-containing amino acids in cassava flour are used to convert released cyanide to thiocyanate (25860, 25887). The production of thiocyanate may depend on the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glycosides, as well as the existence (or absence) of its degrading enzymes (25878).\nExcretion\nIn a human study, 28% of the linamarin content of a sweet variety of cassava was excreted in the urine within 24 hours of consumption (25841).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCassava root and leaves are used as a food and medicine. Both the root and leaves of cassava contain cyanogenic glycosides. The primary cyanogenic glycosides contained in uncooked cassava roots and leaves are linamarin and lotaustralin. These cyanogenic glycosides are metabolized by linamarase, a naturally occurring enzyme in cassava, to release hydrogen cyanide, cyanohydrins, and thiocyanates (10778, 25865, 25876, 25878, 25879, 25880). Levels of cyanide in cassava vary with the parts of the plant. On average, fresh leaves contain approximately 752 mg/kg, fresh skin (rind) contains approximately 184 mg/kg, and fresh flesh (peeled tuber) contains approximately 34 mg/kg (25843). The lethal dose of cyanide for a human that weighs 50 kg is 50-60 mg; for children, the lethal dose is much less (25843). Other factors that affect the amount of cyanide in unprocessed cassava include the cultivar and the growing environment, including the amount of rainfall (26585).\n\nCassava comes in two general varieties: bitter and sweet. Sweet cassava contains lower levels of cyanogenic glycosides compared to bitter varieties (25841). Nutritionally, cassava is similar to the potato, except that cassava contains beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A (25882).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research suggests that linamarin, a cyanogenic glycoside isolated from cassava, is cytotoxic to human leukemia cells when treated in the presence of linamarase (25883).\nAntidiabetes effects\nObservational research has found a link between increased consumption of cassava flour and a modestly reduced risk for type 2 diabetes (99803). The mechanism by which cassava might reduce the risk for diabetes is unclear; however, it does not appear to relate to an effect on glycemic response. Preliminary clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that consuming white bread containing cassava flour 10%, 15%, or 20% does not alter glycemic response when compared with standard white bread (99809)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Cassia auriculata are the flower, seed, leaves, root, bark, and unripe fruit. The flower bud is most commonly used (102784). Flavonoids and other phenolics have been identified from the flower and bud (102784, 102786). Spermidine, quercetin, and cyanidin were identified in the bud extract and hesperidin and vitexin -2\"-O-rhamnoside were identified in the flower extract (102784).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research suggests that Cassia auriculata bud or flower alone or in combination with other herbs have antihyperglycemic activity, reducing blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin, and increasing insulin levels. It may act by stimulating beta-cells to release more insulin (12366, 12370, 102784). It also seems to be similar to acarbose (Precose) in alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (12369). Cassia auriculata bud or flower also seem to have antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant effects, as well as protective effects against liver and kidney damage, in diabetic animals (12367, 12371, 102784). In one animal diabetic model, the bud extract was more effective than the flower extract (102784). Cassia auriculata leaf extract also reduces blood sugar in normal and diabetic animals (12368). In vitro, both the bud and flower extracts of Cassia auriculata inhibit alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities (102784).\nAphrodisiac effects\nCassia auriculata is traditionally used as an aphrodisiac and to increase sperm count. In animal research, Cassia auriculata flower extract increased libido, including the frequency of mounting and ejaculation (102786).\nHepatoprotective effects\nCassia auriculata leaf extract shows potential use for liver disease. In animal models of alcoholism, it protects against free radical damage. It restores hepatic levels of glutathione, which is involved in protective antioxidant activity, and serum vitamin E and C levels. It also lowers hepatic enzymes, suggesting that it prevents damage to hepatic parenchymal cells (12372)."

Cassia cinnamon has Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status in the US for use as a spice or flavoring agent (4912) ...when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Cassia cinnamon up to 2 grams daily has been used safely for up to 3 months (17011, 21914). Cassia cinnamon 3-6 grams daily has been used safely for up to 6 weeks (11347, 14344). Cassia cinnamon extract corresponding to 3 grams daily of cassia cinnamon powder has also been used safely for up to 4 months (21916).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used topically, short-term. Cassia cinnamon oil 5% cream applied topically to the legs has been used safely in one clinical trial (59580).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in high doses, long-term. Some cassia cinnamon products contain high levels of coumarin. Coumarin can cause hepatotoxicity in animal models (15299, 21920). In humans, very high doses of coumarin from 50-7000 mg daily can result in hepatotoxicity that resolves when coumarin use is discontinued (15302). In most cases, ingestion of cassia cinnamon will not provide a high enough amount of coumarin to cause significant toxicity; however, in especially sensitive people, such as those with liver disease, prolonged ingestion of large amounts of cassia cinnamon might exacerbate the condition.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, cassia cinnamon appears to be well-tolerated. Significant side effects have not been reported in most patients.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nTopically: Burning mouth, stomatitis.\nDermatologic\nIn one clinical trial, a rash was reported in one patient taking cassia cinnamon 1 gram daily for 90 days (17011).\n\nIn one case, a 58-year-old female with a documented allergy to topically applied cinnamic alcohol presented with eyelid dermatitis, which was found to be a manifestation of systemic contact dermatitis to cinnamon in the diet. Symptoms improved in two days and completely cleared five days after discontinuing the addition of cinnamon to food products (95599). In other case reports, two adults presented with allergic contact cheilitis following the ingestion of chai tea with cinnamon and yogurt with cinnamon. Cinnamon components were confirmed as the causative allergic agents with patch tests, and both cases of allergic contact cheilitis completely resolved upon cessation of the cinnamon-containing products (113516, 113515).\n\nTopically, allergic skin reactions and stomatitis from toothpaste flavored with cassia cinnamon have been reported (11915, 11920). Intraoral allergic reactions with symptoms of tenderness and burning sensations of the oral mucosa have also been reported in patients using breath fresheners, toothpaste, mouthwash, candy, or chewing gum containing cinnamon, cinnamic aldehyde or cinnamic alcohol as flavoring agents. Glossodynia, or burning mouth syndrome, has also been reported in a 62-year-old female who ate apples dipped in cinnamon nightly (95598), and allergic contact dermatitis has been reported in a teenage female using a homemade cinnamon sugar face scrub (95596).\nless\nEndocrine\nIn one clinical trial, a hypoglycemic seizure was reported in one patient taking cassia cinnamon 1 gram daily for 3 months. The event occurred one day after enrolling in the study (89648). It is unclear if cassia cinnamon caused this event.\nless\nHepatic\nThere is some concern about the safety of ingesting large amounts of cassia cinnamon for extended durations due to its coumarin content. Coumarin can cause hepatotoxicity in animal models (15299). In humans, very high doses of coumarin from 50-7000 mg/day can result in hepatotoxicity that resolves when coumarin is discontinued (15302). In clinical trials, taking cassia cinnamon 360 mg to 12 grams daily for 3 months did not significantly increase levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) (21918, 96280, 108259). However, in one case report, acute hepatitis with elevated AST and ALT occurred in a 73-year-old female who started taking a cinnamon supplement (dose unknown) one week prior to admission. The cinnamon supplement was added on to high-dose rosuvastatin, which may have led to additive adverse hepatic effects. After discontinuing both products, liver function returned to normal, and the patient was able to restart rosuvastati without further complications (97249). In most cases, ingestion of cassia cinnamon won't provide a high enough amount of coumarin to cause significant toxicity; however, in especially sensitive people, such as those with liver disease or taking potentially hepatotoxic agents, prolonged ingestion of large amounts of cassia cinnamon might exacerbate the condition.\nless\nImmunologic\nAn unspecified allergic reaction was reported in one patient taking cassia cinnamon 1 gram daily for 3 months (89648).\nless",

Although there has been interest in using oral cassia cinnamon for amenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cassia cinnamon for this purpose.\nAngina. Although there has been interest in using oral cassia cinnamon for angina, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cassia cinnamon for this purpose.\nCommon cold. Although there has been interest in using oral cassia cinnamon for the common cold, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cassia cinnamon for this purpose.\nDiabetes. Several clinical trials have evaluated oral cassia cinnamon for type 2 diabetes, but results are conflicting.\nSome clinical studies and meta-analyses of cassia cinnamon have found significant benefits in patients with diabetes (11347, 17011, 21914, 21918, 89646, 89649), while others have not (14344, 16010, 17689, 21915, 21916, 89650). Results from meta-analyses are also mixed with respect to lowering fasting blood glucose and lipid levels (89647, 108264). A meta-analysis including more than 500 adults with type 2 diabetes show that taking cassia cinnamon 120 mg To 14.4 grams daily for 4-18 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by an average of 25 mg/dL, total cholesterol by 16 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 9 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 30 mg/dL, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 2 mg/dL (89647). Analyses included studies examining either extract or powder, and two of the studies included used an unspecified type of cinnamon. In contrast, a more recent meta-analysis of studies limited to cassia cinnamon ground bark powder 1-2 grams daily for 40-90 days shows no benefit on fasting blood glucose or lipid levels (108264).\n\nEvidence regarding cassia cinnamon's effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is mixed. In patients with type 2 diabetes, a meta-analysis of 18 low-quality clinical studies shows that cassia cinnamon lowers HbA1c by about 0.6% when compared with placebo (113675). However, other studies suggest that cassia cinnamon does not change HbA1c, although some of the studies were too short to detect a change (89647, 108264). The individual studies included in the meta-analyses were also small, and very heterogenous in relation to dose, duration, use of conventional medications, and diabetes control at baseline (89647, 108264).\n\nCassia cinnamon has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A study in treatment-naïve adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a combination product containing cassia cinnamon extract 100 mg, black seed extract, and ficin extract (NW Low-Glu) 4-5 times daily for 12 weeks reduces HbA1c by 0.6-0.8% and 2-hour postprandial glucose by 25-35 mg/dl when compared to baseline, with similar findings when compared with metformin. However, there were no notable differences in fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and beta cell function (111710). It is unclear if these effects are due to cassia cinnamon, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nIn patients with type 1 diabetes, clinical research shows that taking cassia cinnamon daily does not improve fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin sensitivity, or the rate of hypoglycemic episodes (16010, 89648).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral cassia cinnamon is beneficial for diarrhea.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with diarrhea shows that taking cinnamon water extract 1200 mg twice daily for 8 weeks increases colonic transit time by about 10 hours but does not improve other symptoms of diarrhea including percentage of bowel movements with diarrhea, Bristol stool scale score, abdominal pain, bowel urgency, or abdominal distension when compared with placebo (111712).\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral cassia cinnamon is beneficial for dyslipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of 12 clinical studies in adults with metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and overweight or obesity shows that taking cassia cinnamon daily for 2-4 months reduces total cholesterol by 7 mg/dL, triglycerides by 9 mg/dL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 6 mg/dL but does not increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Subgroup analysis suggests that cassia cinnamon improves lipid profiles of Asian patients but not European or American patients. Additionally, higher doses appear to regulate lipid profiles better, and cassia cinnamon doses above 1.5 grams daily increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by about 2.5 mg/dL. Subgroup analysis also shows that cassia cinnamon only reduces triglycerides for patients with metabolic syndrome and increases HDL cholesterol for patients with PCOS but does not impact total cholesterol for those with type 2 diabetes (111709).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Although there has been interest in using oral cassia cinnamon for ED, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cassia cinnamon for this purpose.\nGastritis. It is unclear if oral cassia cinnamon is beneficial for gastritis.\nA large clinical trial in adults in Korea with acute or chronic gastritis shows that taking cassia cinnamon 225 mg daily for up to 14 days improves the gastric erosion rate by approximately 1.4-fold when compared with control. A subgroup analysis indicates this effect was most pronounced in patients with chronic gastritis (115487).\nless\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral cassia cinnamon for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cassia cinnamon for this purpose.\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). The effects of cassia cinnamon in patients with impaired glucose tolerance are unclear; results from clinical research are conflicting.\nA small clinical study in patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking cassia cinnamon powder 6 grams twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve fasting plasma glucose or insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo (96280). However, another clinical study in overweight or obese patients with impaired fasting blood glucose shows that taking a dried aqueous extract of cassia cinnamon 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by about 12 mg/dL when compared with baseline, but does not affect fasting insulin levels (93118). Another preliminary clinical trial in overweight or obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product, (Glycabiane, PiLeJe) containing cassia cinnamon extract 228 mg, chromium chloride 10 mcg, and carnosine 100 mg per capsule, daily for 4 months decreases fasting blood glucose by 6.5 mg/dL but has no effect on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin sensitivity, or body weight, when compared with placebo (94234). It is unclear whether these effects are due to cassia cinnamon, ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMosquito repellent. It is unclear if topical cassia cinnamon is beneficial as a mosquito repellent.\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that applying a cream containing cassia cinnamon oil 5% to the skin provides protection from mosquito bites. However, the repellency of this cream appears to decrease more quickly over time compared to MeiMei cream (containing citronella and geranium oils) and Repellan S aerosol (containing 19% N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET)) (59580).\nless\nMuscle cramps. Although there has been interest in using oral cassia cinnamon for muscle cramps, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cassia cinnamon for this purpose.\nNausea and vomiting. Although there has been interest in using oral cassia cinnamon for nausea and vomiting, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cassia cinnamon for this purpose.\nObesity. It is unclear if oral cassia cinnamon is beneficial for weight loss.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small number of patients with overweight or obesity and impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (Glycabiane, PiLeJe) containing cassia cinnamon extract 228 mg, chromium chloride 10 mcg, and carnosine 100 mg per capsule, daily for 4 months does not decrease body weight, BMI, fat mass, or lipid levels when compared with placebo (94234).\n\nA very small clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking a single dose of cinnamon infusion containing 2 grams of powdered cinnamon served along with breakfast does not increase energy expenditure, diet-induced thermogenesis, respiratory quotient, or lipid and carbohydrate oxidation and does not affect appetite responses including hunger, fullness, desire to eat, macronutrient intake, and food intake throughout the day when compared with control. Furthermore, cassia cinnamon intake reduces feelings of satiety and increases energy intake in the first meal after the intervention when compared with control (111707). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral cassia cinnamon is beneficial for patients with PCOS.\nA small observational study in adults with PCOS suggests that taking cinnamon 500 mg three times daily for 8 weeks is associated with decreased body weight, body mass index, insulin resistance, and testosterone but does not appear to alter levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), insulin, or lipids when compared with placebo (113514).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral cassia cinnamon is beneficial for stroke prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with a mild ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack shows that taking cinnamon (Chinese herbal formula granules, Guangdong Yifang Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd) 5 grams with aspirin 100 mg daily for 90 days, starting within 24 hours of the ischemia, reduces the percentage of patients with a recurrent stroke to 3%, compared with 15% of those taking aspirin plus placebo. There were also modest improvements in levels of plasma lipids, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin, as well as a reduced likelihood of identifying unstable or severe plaques on carotid ultrasound (108265). The use of cassia cinnamon, specifically, was not confirmed; however, this species of cinnamon is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, as indicated in the study.\nless\nUrinary incontinence.

Cinnamaldehyde is found in the volatile oil fraction of cassia cinnamon and gives it its odor and taste. The volatile oil from cassia cinnamon bark contains about 67% to 90% cinnamaldehyde, also known as cinnamic aldehyde, cinnamal, beta-phenylacrolein, and 3-phenylpropanal, also known as hydrocinnamaldehyde (15301, 95598).\n\nCassia cinnamon contains coumarin in concentrations ranging from 0.004% to 1.2% (15299, 15300, 15301). The amount of coumarin in one kilogram of cassia cinnamon powder ranges from 2.1-4.4 grams, meaning that the coumarin content in one teaspoon of cassia cinnamon would be approximately 6-12 mg (89652). Cassia cinnamon contains higher concentrations of coumarin compared to Ceylon cinnamon. The presence of coumarin and other compounds can be used to distinguish cassia cinnamon from Ceylon cinnamon (15300).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research shows that the cassia cinnamon constituent cinnamaldehyde has antibacterial activity against certain human intestinal bacteria, including Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum (11244).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research suggests that some constituents isolated from cassia cinnamon may have anti-tumor activity. Cinnamaldehydes and related compounds might have some activity against human solid tumor cells HCT15 and SK-MEL-2 (11246).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPolyphenolic polymers such as hydroxychalcone found in cassia cinnamon seem to potentiate insulin action. These compounds seem to increase phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, which increases insulin sensitivity. Increased insulin sensitivity may improve blood glucose control and lipid levels. Cinnamon extracts also seem to activate glycogen synthetase and increase glucose uptake (11247, 11248, 11249).\n\nResearch in animal models suggests that cassia cinnamon stimulates a baseline insulin release, but does not seem to lower baseline glucose levels. However, during a glucose tolerance test, cassia cinnamon seems to stimulate insulin release and also significantly lowers blood glucose. Animal and in vitro research suggests that cassia cinnamon has a greater insulin-stimulating effect than Ceylon cinnamon (13238).\n\nResearch in healthy humans shows that cassia cinnamon improves glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, short-term (89654, 89655); however, clinical trials in diabetic patients have shown conflicting results. Research in overweight and sedentary but otherwise healthy women shows that a single dose of cassia cinnamon reduces peak blood glucose levels but does not alter insulin sensitivity (95646).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that water-soluble polymers isolated from cassia cinnamon have antioxidant activity (11247).\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn vitro research suggests that cassia cinnamon may have immunomodulating activity through inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and induction of T-cell differentiation (11245).\nUric acid lowering effects\nA combination of cassia cinnamon bark extract and Chrysanthemum indicum flower extract reduces serum uric acid levels in rats and promotes excretion of uric acid in the urine. The combination also inhibits xanthine oxidase activity, hepatic uric acid production, and cellular uptake of uric acid in vitro. In patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, taking a specific combination of cassia cinnamon bark extract and Chrysanthemum indicum flower extract (DKB114, Dongkook Pharm. Co. Ltd.) 4 grams twice daily for 12 weeks reduces serum uric acid by 7.3% from baseline, compared with a 0.26% reduction in those taking placebo (104800). It is unclear if this effect is due to cassia cinnamon, Chrysanthemum indicum, or the combination."

In one case report, a child developed cheilitis over the course of 3 weeks, which was determined to be an allergic reaction to castor oil contained in lip balm (103864).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, castor oil, like all stimulant laxatives, can cause abdominal discomfort, cramping, nausea, and faintness (15, 272, 40183, 40186, 40187, 40192, 40177, 40185, 40188, 40163). Nausea can also occur because of the unpleasant taste of castor oil (7191). Using flavored products might reduce this effect. Castor oil can also cause fluid and electrolyte loss, particularly potassium, which can result in hypokalemia. It can also cause malabsorption from intestinal hypermotility (15, 272). Chronic ingestion over long periods of time can lead to cathartic colon (15).\n\nChewing whole castor bean seeds causes severe toxicity. Gastrointestinal symptoms of castor seed toxicity typically occur with 4-6 hours of ingestion and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain which usually resolves after supportive care (7128, 13715, 92998, 93000, 93505).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, hulled castor seeds have been associated with cases of dysmenorrhea (7128).

However, research evaluating castor oil in comparison to other bowel preparations is limited by complex regimens and high dropout rates. Some clinical research shows that oral castor oil, alone or in combination with a cleansing enema, has similar efficacy for bowel preparation as bisacodyl or bisacodyl plus magnesium citrate (40166, 40173, 40185). However, other research shows that bisacodyl plus magnesium citrate is superior to castor oil or castor oil plus calcium bisdioctyl sulfosuccinate (40163, 40187). Also, solutions of oral sodium phosphate seem to be more effective for bowel preparation prior to a colonoscopy compared to castor oil (40192).

Castor oil eye drops appear to reduce tear evaporation but do not increase tear production.\nOne clinical study in patients with mild to moderate dry eye shows that using castor oil 1.25% emulsion eye drops three times daily for 30 days decreases tear evaporation rate when compared with a hypromellose ophthalmic lubricant (40178). Another clinical study in patients with dry eye secondary to obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction shows that using castor oil 2% lubricating eye drops six times daily for 2 weeks improves gland obstruction assessments and dry eye symptom scores and decreases tear evaporation when compared with saline eye drops (40169).\nless\nParturition.

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nOrally, castor seed can cause severe toxicity due to its ricin content. Overall, more than 750 cases of ricin poisonings in humans have been documented (40176).\n\nAfter ingestion, ricin, the toxic constituent of the seed, causes gastrointestinal symptoms usually within 4-6 hours, but symptoms may be delayed (13715, 92998, 93000, 93505, 93507). Chewing whole seeds can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dehydration, shock, hemolysis, severe fluid and electrolyte disturbances, peripheral vascular collapse, renal failure secondary to hypovolemia, and death. Cellular damage to liver, kidneys, and pancreas typically occurs 2-5 days after ingestion (5611, 5612, 92998, 93000, 93505, 93507). There is conflicting information regarding the quantity of ricin that will cause toxicity upon ingestion. Some sources state that ingesting 1-2 grams of ricin is lethal to humans and ingesting even 1 castor bean has resulted in toxicity (92996). Some sources state that as few as 1-6 seeds can be lethal in humans (5611). Other reports show ingestion of more than 10 castor seeds causing initial gastrointestinal symptoms, but the subjects have a full recovery after supportive treatment (93505). It is possible that the variability in lethality depends on the degree of seed hull rupture when the seed was ingested. Rupture of the seed hull seems to be necessary to cause toxicity. Swallowing seeds whole, without chewing, is less likely to cause toxic effects; however, prompt medical attention should be received after ingestion of any whole seed. Serum chemistries should be monitored for at least 5 days after ingestion in symptomatic patients (5611).\n\nAfter injection, ricin causes illness within 6 hours. The lethal dose in humans is estimated to be 1-10 mcg/kg. Symptoms include generalized weakness and myalgias. Symptoms may progress to vomiting, fever, hypotension, multiorgan failure, and death (13715, 40176).\nTreatment\nTreatment is supportive; there is no approved antidote (13715).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCastor oil is a glyceride that can be absorbed from the intestine and metabolized as a fatty acid (272). Onset of bowel evacuant action of ricinoleic acid, a constituent in castor oil, is usually within 2 hours, but sometimes can take up to 6 hours (16).\nMetabolism\nCastor oil is hydrolyzed in the duodenum by pancreatic lipase to release ricinoleic acid, which is thought to have stimulant laxative effects (272, 40167).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of castor are the seeds (beans) and oil. Castor oil is produced by cold pressing ripe seeds. Ricinoleic acid is one of the main constituents of castor oil (40167). Unlike the seeds, castor oil does not contain the deadly poison ricin (13715). Castor seeds are best known for their toxic effects because they contain about 1% to 5% of the toxic glycoprotein, ricin. Pure ricin is a white powder that is water soluble and stable over a wide pH range. Ricin can be fatal when ingested, inhaled, or given intravenously. Ricin is an N-glycosidase that affects an RNA subunit and interferes with protein synthesis, causing cell death (5611, 13715). It may also cause toxicity by inducing apoptosis (cell death), causing direct cell membrane damage, changing cell membrane structure and function, and releasing cytokine inflammatory mediators (13715, 92995).\nAnalgesic effects\nThe castor bean plant has been used for its nociceptive effects in conditions such as headaches and arthritis. Preliminary research in animals shows that castor bean plant leaf extract given intraperitoneally produces an analgesic effect in experimentally induced pain compared to control (93504). The mechanism of this effect is unclear.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nRoots of the castor bean plant have been traditionally used for rheumatism and inflammation (92997). Castor bean paste has been used for reducing inflammation and pain in skin conditions, migraines, and inflammation of the middle ear. Some preliminary research in animals shows that ricinoleic acid, a constituent of castor oil, reduced inflammation and edema that was experimentally induced by histamine and carrageenan injections (40167).\nAntimicrobial effects\nPreliminary research shows that essential oil from the castor bean plant has antibacterial properties especially against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae in animal and laboratory studies (92995, 93508). The mechanism of its antimicrobial effects is unclear.\nAntineoplastic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that ricin, a toxic constituent of castor bean, might be useful in cancer treatment if targeted specifically to cancer cells (13715, 92995, 93508). Ricin is an N-glycosidase that affects an RNA subunit and interferes with protein synthesis, causing cell death (5611, 13715). It may induce apoptosis (cell death), cause direct cell membrane damage, change cell membrane structure and function, and/or release cytokine inflammatory mediators (13715).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn an animal model of cardiovascular dysfunction, a methanolic extract of the castor leaf improved cardiovascular function, cardiac electrical activity, and lipid profile (117052).\nContraceptive effects\nIt is unclear how castor seeds work as a contraceptive in females; however, its effects do not seem to be hormonally-mediated (7127, 7128, 40179). Preliminary research suggests that castor bean plant may play a role in male contraception. The crude stem bark extracts of the castor bean plant decrease the motility human sperm in a dose-dependent manner in in vitro research (93502).\nGastrointestinal\nCastor oil is hydrolyzed in the duodenum by pancreatic lipase to release ricinoleic acid, which might have stimulant laxative effects (272). Although the exact mechanism of ricinoleic acid is unknown, the laxative effect appears to result from fluid secretion induced by cyclic adenosine monophosphate and also because of the increased peristalsis due to an irritant effect (272, 40166, 40182). Onset of bowel evacuant action is usually within 2 hours, but sometimes can take up to 6 hours (16).\nInsecticidal effects\nPreliminary research shows that castor bean plant leaf extract is lethal to adult female mosquitos and larvae carrying the malaria vector (93506). The mechanism of the insecticidal effect is unclear.\nLabor induction\nIn pregnancy, castor oil is thought to induce labor by producing hyperemia in the intestinal tract, which causes reflex stimulation of the uterus (16). Castor oil might also increase prostaglandin production, which stimulates uterine activity (7191, 40190).\nOcular effects\nCastor oil has been used for dry eye. Castor oil emulsions can reduce tear evaporation and improve tear stability by modifying and augmenting of the lipid layer of the tear for up to four hours (40169, 40170, 40172, 40178)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of catechu are the leaf and stem. Active constituents include tannins, catechin, gambrine, and fisetin (12851). The tannin content causes the astringent and antibacterial properties of catechu. Catechin causes blood vessel constriction (11).\nAnalgesic effects\nCatechu has been shown to have analgesic effects. Preliminary research suggests that catechu has analgesic effects in experimentally induced pain in animal models, possibly by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) (94565).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCatechu has been used traditionally for various inflammatory conditions and has been studied for osteoarthritis. Preliminary research suggests catechu can modestly inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 (12851). A specific Baikal skullcap extract of baicalin in combination with a specific catechu extract, known as flavocoxid (Limbrel, Primus Pharmaceuticals), also seems to inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in vitro and in animal models (17031, 17032).\nAnti-viral effects\nPreliminary research suggests that both aqueous and ethanolic extracts of catechu inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 in vitro, possibly by inhibiting the viral protease (94562). Theoretically, catechu may have an effect against HIV replication.\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary research suggests that catechu extracts can cause vasodilation and might have hypotensive effects. The gambrine constituent might be responsible for these hypotensive effects (14144). Methylcatechin, which is one of the major metabolites of catechin, inhibits the binding of monocytes to vascular endothelial cells. This suggests that the catechins found in catechu may reduce atherosclerosis (9444).\nHepatic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that fisetin and catechin might have protective effects against liver damage in animal models. Catechin is also thought to protect against experimentally-induced ulcers in animals (11).\nImmunomodulant effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that catechu extracts have immunomodulant effects. In mice, catechu increased hemagglutinating antibody titers and the number of antibody-producing cells in the spleen. In vitro, catechu increased phagocytosis, inhibited the production of nitric oxide, inhibited the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and increased the production of interleukin (IL)-10 (103271). This suggests that catechu may have both immunostimulant and immunosuppressant activity. Additionally, a small clinical study in healthy adults receiving a quadrivalent influenza vaccine shows that taking a supplement containing catechu and Baikal skullcap extracts twice daily for 28 days before and 28 days after vaccination modestly increases immunoglobulin levels after vaccination without improving levels of influenza-A or influenza-B specific antibodies or lymphocyte response when compared with placebo (112175).\nNeurological effects\nCatechu has been considered for use in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Preliminary research suggests that catechu leaf has anti-oxidant activity and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity which may benefit cognition and reduce neurological damage (94564). Preliminary research also suggests that catechu improves memory and the processing complex information in human and animal models (94566)."

Nepetalactone, a constituent of catnip, makes up 80-95% of the volatile oil of catnip and is structurally related to the valepotriates found in valerian. Catnip provides approximately 0.2-1% volatile oil (6, 40200). Other constituents of catnip essential oil include geranyl acetate, citronellyl acetate, citronellol, and geraniol (40198). Verbascoside and 1,5,9-epi-deoxyloganic acid have been found in the aerial parts of catnip (40197).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research shows that a diethyl ether extract of catnip has antimicrobial activity against fungi and Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (40196).\nCNS effects\nThe constituent cis-trans-nepetalcatone is thought to produce the characteristic euphoric effects observed when cats smell catnip (5). Although humans have used catnip to induce a euphoric high, whether or not this effect actually occurs in humans is controversial. In humans, the constituent nepetalactone is thought to be responsible for catnip's calming effects in insomnia, anxiety, gastrointestinal conditions, and migraine headache. CNS depressant effects of catnip have been reported in a toddler who consumed a large quantity of catnip (2596). Currently, clinical studies addressing the safety or efficacy of catnip for its purported CNS effects are lacking, although sleep-inducing effects of catnip have been reported in animal studies (40204, 40205, 40202).\nGastrointestinal effects\nCatnip is said to stimulate gallbladder activity (6).\nGenitourinary effects\nCatnip reportedly has diuretic effects and is said to aid in the stimulation of gallbladder activity (6). Some preliminary animal research suggests that catnip might improve sexual behavior. Catnip increased the frequency and duration of erections in rats (98140).\nImmunologic effects\nCatnip reportedly has antipyretic and diaphoretic effects, which have been attributed to its use for the common cold, influenza, and fever (6).\nInsect repellent effects\nIn vitro and human studies show that catnip has insect repellant effects (40199, 40200, 40201, 98141, 98142). However, the mechanism of these effects is unclear. In vitro, catnip essential oil has been shown to kill insect larvae and repel mosquitoes and flies (40201, 98142). Preliminary research shows that the catnip constituent nepetalactone seems to be a better spatial repellent, but not contact repellent, compared to DEET against mosquitos species including Aedes aegypti, Anopheles albimanus Weidemann, and Anopheles quadrimaculatus (40199). Furthermore, some preliminary in vitro research shows that catnip essential oils also have repellent activity comparable to DEET against the Anopheles gambiae mosquito. Catnip essential oils show weaker repellent activity against Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitos. Individual catnip oil constituents seem to have lower repellent activity compared with the natural mixture of catnip essential oils (98141)."

A patient with systemic lupus erythematosus developed acute kidney failure after taking cat's claw, which improved upon its discontinuation (40279). Another patient with a history of cancer who consumed keto-diet shakes containing cat's claw developed biopsy-confirmed acute interstitial nephritis requiring treatment with prednisone. The patient's serum creatinine normalized three months later after stopping the shake (111737). A separate case cited nephrolithiasis linked to a product containing cat's claw (Digestive Advantage and FlexProtex), likely due to its excipient silica dioxide. The patient's symptoms were reduced after discontinuation (40244).\n\nA clinical study also reported a mild serum creatinine increase in 6% of patients taking oral cat's claw, but causality remains unclear due to the advanced disease states of the participants.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of cat's claw.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of cat's claw are the root and bark. Most commercial preparations of cat's claw contain the plant species Uncaria tomentosa. Cat's claw is found in two different chemotypes producing different alkaloidal constituents. Pentacyclic oxindoles are found in the roots of one type, while the tetracyclic oxindoles are present in the second type (40206). Uncarine C and uncarine E are two stereoisomers of the pentacyclic oxindoles (40210). Other alkaloids of the tetracyclic oxindoles found in cat's claw include rhynchophylline, mitraphylline, and isorhynchophylline (7226, 40268). Cat's claw also contains 3,4-dehydro-5-carboxystrictosidine (40209) and seven quinovic acid glycosides (40245, 40273). It also contains tannins (40227).\n\nCat's claw bark contains ursolic acid, oleanolic acid (40245), beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol (40274), and three polyhydroxylated triterpenes (40265). The C-8-(S) isomer of deoxyloganic acid (7-deoxyloganic acid), together with beta-sitosteryl glucoside, five known stereoisomeric pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids, and the tetracyclic oxindole isorhynchophylline, have been isolated from the inner bark of Uncaria tomentosa (40210).\n\nRotundifoline and isorotundifoline (40276), quinovic acid glycosides 1-7, flavonoids, and coumarins (40227, 40245) have all been isolated from cat's claw (U. tomentosa). Cat's claw vine accumulates nearly 80% palmitoleic acid (16:1delta9) plus cis-vaccenic acid (18:1delta11) in its seed oil. Acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) desaturases can be isolated from developing cat's claw seeds (40281).\nAlzheimer disease effects\nMitraphylline isolated from cat's claw (U. tomentosa) shows significant binding with beta-amyloid 1-40 (40240). According to animal research, pteropodine and isopteropodine (heteroyohimbine-type oxindole alkaloid components of cat's claw (U. tomentosa)) may have a beneficial effect on memory loss caused by cholinergic dysfunction. These alkaloids seem to enhance central cholinergic transmission by increasing acetylcholine levels or by affecting dopaminergic systems that can enhance cholinergic function. Another constituent, uncarine E, might also affect the glutamate system, which might play a critical role in memory and cognition (7226).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAccording to in vitro and clinical research, the anti-inflammatory properties of Uncaria guianensis and Uncaria tomentosa may result from their ability to inhibit TNF-alpha and, to a lesser extent, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production (7317, 7225, 40230, 40239, 40250, 40267). In vitro, cat's claw is a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha production (7225).\n\nAdditional in vitro research has further characterized the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of U. tomentosa and U. guianensis (40217). The plants contain both alkaloids and flavonols, and each species exhibits effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, although U. guianensis seems to be more potent.\n\nIn animal research, cat's claw (U. tomentosa) extract protects mice against ozone-induced lung inflammation (40225). An in vivo study comparing the effectiveness of a spray-dried hydroalcoholic extract against an aqueous freeze-dried extract in mice shows that anti-inflammatory activity was significantly higher using the hydroalcoholic extract (40216). The extracts also showed little inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase-1 or -2.\n\nIn animal research, extracts and fractions of cat's claw (U. tomentosa) have varying degrees of anti-inflammatory activity when tested in rat paw edema. However, when the isolated compounds in those fractions are tested, little anti-inflammatory activity is observed (8969, 40245). In preliminary pharmacological investigations, sterols (beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol) in cat's claw (U. tomentosa) appear to contribute to anti-inflammatory activity (40274).\n\nIn animal research, alkaloids of cat's claw (U. tomentosa) quinovic acid glycosides exhibit anti-inflammatory properties (40245) and inhibit nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) (40248).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn laboratory research, micropulverized cat's claw (U. tomentosa) shows antimicrobial activity against Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus mutans, and Staphylococcus species (40242). However, increased colony-stimulating activity was observed in the serum of normal mice and those infected with Listeria monocytogenes after pretreatment with 100 mg/kg of cat's claw (U. tomentosa) extract (15097).\nAnticoagulant effects\nIn animal research, cat's claw demonstrates antiplatelet effects (40220). Laboratory findings indicate that cat's claw contains rhynchophylline, which may inhibit platelet aggregation (40277, 40276). In vivo, isorhynchophylline demonstrates anticoagulant effects (40268).\nAntinociceptive effects\nIn animal research, cat's claw (U. tomentosa) produces dose-related antinociception in several models of chemical and thermal pain through mechanisms that involve an interaction with 5-HT2 receptors (40229).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, decoctions prepared from the bark of cat's claw (U. tomentosa) have high antioxidant capacity, as indicated by free radical diphenylpicrylhydrazyl capacity, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, peroxyl radical-trapping capacity, and superoxide radical-scavenging activity. The decoctions react with superoxide anion, peroxyl, and hydroxyl radicals, as well as with the oxidant species hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid (40228, 40232). The decoctions also protect membrane lipids against peroxidation induced by the iron-ascorbate system, as evaluated by the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The phenolic profile of the decoction includes proanthocyanidins (oligomeric procyanidins) and phenolic acids (mainly caffeic acid).\n\nIn vitro, cat's claw (U. tomentosa) demonstrates antioxidant properties when incubated with macrophages with oxidant-induced stress (40217). It is also cytoprotective against DPPH and UV irradiation (7225, 40217). Further in vitro research shows that cat's claw limits epithelial cell death in response to oxidant stress (40214). Other in vitro research shows that cat's claw protects cells against oxidative stress and negates the activation of NF-kappaB (7225, 40282).\n\nIn vitro, cat's claw (U. tomentosa) in a 10% aqueous solution demonstrates antioxidant activity when assessed by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) assay (40270).\n\nIn vitro, cat's claw extract reduces release of oxidative markers such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and PGE2, enhances oxidative stimulation, increases interleukin-6 (IL-6), partially increases IL-8, and reduces TNF-alpha (40267).\nAntitumor effects\nQuinic acid is a biologically active component of the bark of cat's claw (U. tomentosa) hot water extract (C-Med-100) (40224, 40226). According to in vitro research, C-Med-100 inhibits tumor cell proliferation and inflammatory responses (40221). However, the extract does not interfere with IL-2 production or IL-2 receptor signaling.\n\nAccording to animal research, C-Med-100 induces cell proliferation arrest and inhibits activation of the transcriptional regulator NF-kappaB in vitro. According to in vitro research, cat's claw extracts and fractions exert direct antiproliferative activity on several cell lines, including breast cancer, glioma, neuroblastoma, premyelocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (40213, 40233, 40235, 40241, 40243).\n\nIn vitro, cat's claw (U. tomentosa) demonstrates antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in human medullary thyroid carcinoma cells by inhibiting cell growth and mitochondrial dehydrogenase, and increasing the expression of caspase-3 and -7 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fraction (40251). The alkaloid mitraphylline from cat's claw (U. tomentosa) bark demonstrates antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects on Ewing's sarcoma and breast cancer cell lines by inhibiting growth (40249). Cat's claw (U. tomentosa) also demonstrates anticancer activity against Lewis lung carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma by inhibition of the cell cycles of tumor cells (40252). Mitraphylline extracted from cat's claw (U. tomentosa) inner bark inhibits the growth of glioma GAMG and neuroblastoma SKN-BE2 cell lines. In animals, apoptosis of neoplastic cells, proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells, and increased neutrophil count are demonstrated after cat's claw (U. tomentosa) use (40261).\n\nIn vitro, an extract of cat's claw can induce tumor cell death (apoptosis), may have antimutagenic activity (7224, 8969), and inhibits proliferation of leukemia and lymphoma cells (7225). Cat's claw does not appear to be cytotoxic to normal cells (7227, 8969).\n\nIn an animal and in vitro study, apigenin, bisabolol, and protocatechuic acid from Matricaria chamomilla and Uncaria tomentosa demonstrate tumoricidal activity and apoptosis in HL-60 leukemia cells; however, genotoxic effects are lacking (40259). In vitro, aqueous and alkaloid-rich cat's claw (U. tomentosa) extracts inhibit the Wnt-signaling pathway in HeLa, HCT116, and SW480 cancer cells (40258).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, quinovic acid glycosides from cat's claw (U. tomentosa) exhibit antiviral properties when tested against two RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus, and rhinovirus 1B (40273).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn vivo, isorhynchophylline and rhynchophylline demonstrate cardiovascular effects in conditions such as hypertension, bradycardia, and arrhythmia, by modulating calcium ion channels (40255, 40268). Rhynchophylline may cause hypotension and reduce heart rate (40276, 40277).\nChondroprotective effects\nA combination product containing cat's claw (U. tomentosa) demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects in osteoarthritis on chondrocytes and cartilage by strong inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-13 expression, and nitric oxide (NO) production in interleukin-1beta-stimulated chondrocytes (40262). Also, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release is blocked, aggrecan (ACAN) and type II collagen (COL2A1) are upregulated, and NF-kappaB activation is inhibited.\nCNS effects\nTetracyclic oxindole alkaloids reportedly affect the central nervous system. Animal research shows that the alkaloid fraction of cat's claw (U. tomentosa) attenuates the amnesic effect of scopolamine (7226). The oxindole alkaloids uncarine E, uncarine C, mitraphylline, rhynchophylline, and isorhynchophylline may be at least partially responsible for this effect.\n\nHirsutine and hirsuteine extracted from cat's claw display anticonvulsant properties in mice (40280).\n\nIn vivo, isorhynchophylline and rhynchophylline demonstrate effects in central nervous system conditions such as sedation, vascular dementia, epileptic seizures, drug addiction, cerebral ischemia, and amnesia, possibly by modulating calcium ion channels, protecting neural and neuroglial cells against beta-amyloid(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity, and inducing autophagy (40255, 40268).\n\nIn vivo, isorhynchophylline demonstrates therapeutic effects in neurological diseases such as Parkinson by degrading alpha-synuclein and inducing autophagy in neuronal cell lines (40264).\nEndocrine effects\nAccording to animal research, serum estradiol and progesterone levels may be reduced after chronic cat's claw ingestion (40283). According to in vitro research, cat's claw extract may dose-dependently inhibit progesterone (40283). In vitro, an aqueous extract of cat's claw (U. tomentosa) prevents estrogen from binding to estrogen receptors on breast cancer cells (8660).\nImmunomodulation effects\nIn vitro research using pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids extracted from cat's claw shows enhanced immune function, while tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids inhibit this induced immunostimulation (15098).\n\nIn animal research, cat's claw (U. tomentosa) extracts indirectly modulate immune activity and induce a higher reserve of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow due to biologically active cytokine release (CSFs, IL-1, and IL-6) (15097).\n\nIn mice given the cat's claw (U. tomentosa) extract C-Med-100, there is a dose-dependent increase in spleen cell numbers; however, proportions of B cells, T cells, NK cells, granulocytes, and memory lymphocytes remain normal (15100). No detectable changes of the lymphoid structure of the spleen are observed even after prolonged treatment. Additionally, when the treatment with the C-Med-100 extract is interrupted, the cellularity returns to normal levels within one month.\n\nIn vitro, cat's claw (U. tomentosa) extracts inhibit the MAP kinase signaling pathway and alter cytokine expression, particularly in the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 (40237, 40238). Cat's claw also seems to increase recovery from doxorubicin-induced leukopenia in animal models (15099)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCatuaba is a term that is used to describe various Brazilian plants. The Brazilian Pharmacopeia lists Anemopaegma arvense as catuaba. The root of A. arvense is most commonly used, although the bark is also sometimes used (40307). However, the applicable part of other plant species used as catuaba, especially Trichilia catigua and Erythroxylum vaccinifolium, is the bark (40307). Constituents of Erythroxylum vaccinifolium bark include tropane alkaloids (40291, 40292, 40299, 40311). The bark of Trichilia catigua contains flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, and saponins, such as epicatechin, catechin, and the flavalignans cinchonains Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb (40290, 40294, 40302, 40308, 99273). The bark of Anemopaegma arvense contains catuabin A, cinchonain Ia, cinchonain IIa, cinchonain IIb, and kandelin A1 (40293, 40305).\nAntibacterial effects\nAn alkaline catuaba extract, described as Erythroxylum catuaba, shows antibacterial effects in mice (3916). In vitro, an extract of Trichilia catigua had antibacterial activity against Bacillus species (40290).\nAnticancer effects\nCatuaba is traditionally used for skin cancer. In vitro, Anemopaegma arvense extracts have shown anticancer effects in human epithelial keratinocytes. The cinchonains IIa and IIb also demonstrate protective effects (40293).\nAntidepressant effects\nCatuaba is traditionally used for agitation and nervousness. In animal models, Trichilia catigua had antidepressant-like effects, possibly related to increased levels of serotonin and dopamine as shown in vitro (40298).\nAntifatigue effects\nCatuaba is traditionally used for fatigue. Animal research suggests that Trichilia catigua extract inhibits fatigue (99273).\nAntiviral effects\nAn alkaline catuaba extract, described as Erythroxylum catuaba, inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro (3916)."

Epidemiologic research has found that eating about 1 cup per week of cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, or collards, is associated with a 30% decreased risk of developing bladder cancer in men and women (14864). Other population research has also found that higher intake of cruciferous vegetables, such as cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli, and kale, is associated with a 51% reduction in the risk of developing bladder cancer in men. However, higher intake of cauliflower alone does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer (26184).\nBreast cancer. Population research has found that higher intake of cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, and kale, is associated with a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women, while higher intake of these vegetables is associated with a slight, but statistically insignificant, decrease in the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women (26188).\nDiabetes. Population research suggests that higher intake of cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, is not associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes in women (26187).\nLung cancer. Population research has found that increased dietary intake of cauliflower is associated with a 61% reduction in the risk of lung cancer in women; however, it does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer in men (26185).\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma. Population research has found that, for women, consuming at least half a serving of cauliflower or other green vegetables daily is associated with a lower risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly the follicular lymphoma subtype, compared with eating these vegetables less often. However, eating cauliflower and other green vegetables does not appear to be associated with a reduced risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in men (26186).\nProstate cancer.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCruciferous vegetables of the genus Brassica, which includes cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, kohlrabi, and Brussels sprouts, contain more than 80 micronutrients. These include carotenoids, fiber, minerals, glucosinolates, vitamin K, vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin E, biotin, folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B3, thiamine, and riboflavin. Other constituents include sulfur (26474).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that the cancer-protective effect of cruciferous vegetables may be due to their relatively high content of glucosinolates, including sinigrin, glucobrassicin, and glucoraphanin (6790, 26474, 47575, 51183). Glucosinolates are usually accompanied by myrosinase, a thioglucosidase enzyme. When the plant cells are damaged by cutting or chewing, the glucosinolates are exposed to myrosinase, catalyzing their hydrolysis to isothiocyanates (ITCs), indoles, and nitriles (6792).\n\nITCs, including sulforaphane, phenylethylisothiocyanate, benzylisothiocyanate, and 3-phenylpropylisothiocyanate, are sulfur-containing phytochemicals that have anticancer effects (26449, 26483, 47626, 55547). They enhance the activity of phase II enzymes and inhibit phase I enzymes, thereby reducing the production of carcinogenic electrophilic intermediates and enhancing the detoxification and clearance of carcinogens. ITCs also suppress the promotion phase of the neoplastic process and induce apoptosis (26449, 26484, 26485).\n\nIndoles are a breakdown product of glucosinolates found in cauliflower and include indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) (26465, 47575, 47626). In vitro research shows that indoles inhibit carcinogenesis by inducing cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases, and epoxide hydrolases, which metabolize carcinogens to more polar and excretable forms (14145, 26489, 26491, 47596, 51183). Induction of these enzymes by indoles also attenuates the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines, and heterocyclic amines (51183).\n\nIndoles and phytoestrogens contained in cruciferous vegetables may protect against hormone-dependent breast or cervical cancers. Anticancer effects include induction of apoptosis, inhibition of DNA-carcinogen adduct formation, suppression of free-radical production, stimulation of 2-hydroxylation of estradiol, and inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis (26465, 26469, 26492, 47615, 47627). In vitro studies also show that I3C suppresses proliferation of endometrial, prostate, and colon cancers, and leukemia (47626).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome cruciferous vegetable constituents, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, carotenes, flavonoids, minerals, and other phytochemicals, act as direct antioxidants, neutralizing free radical molecules (26497, 14154). Preliminary research shows that isothiocyanates and indoles from cauliflower and other cruciferous vegetables induce phase I and phase II enzymes, which might reduce oxidative damage associated with cardiovascular disease and cancer (26484, 75832).\nGastrointestinal effects\nPeople who eat a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables (a total of 9 servings per week of cauliflower and broccoli) for 2 weeks have a reduction in the numbers of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the gut, resulting in less hydrogen sulfide production. Hydrogen sulfide has been linked to various gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and ulcerative colitis (101463).\nHepatic effects\nSulforaphane is an isothiocyanate metabolite of glucosinolates found in cauliflower. Studies in human liver cells show that it can penetrate into the cells, and that its conjugates, sulforaphane glutathione and sulforaphane cysteine, weakly inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6. This is unlikely to be clinically relevant because the concentrations of sulforaphane needed are higher than would be found in the liver in vivo (101464)."

Acute symptoms include skin eruption with edema and erythema; the main chronic symptom is hyperpigmentation at the eruption site (41093).\n\nCelery can also cause contact or atopic dermatitis (19, 41118, 41124) and urticaria pigmentosa (40908).\nless\nEndocrine\nCelery has been associated with hyperthyroidism in otherwise healthy adults. In one case report a 36-year-old female presented with weight loss, blurred vision, nausea, palpitations, sweating, exophthalmos, elevated serum T4 levels, and low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels after taking 8 grams of a powdered celery extract for 78 days (102912). In another case report, a 48-year-old male presented with weight loss, exophthalmos, sweating, elevated serum T4 levels, and low TSH levels after taking 4 grams of dried celery leaves for 45 days (102914). In both of these cases, symptoms resolved and thyroid function tests normalized after discontinuing celery and completing a course of methimazole.\n\nIn contrast, several cases of hypothyroidism with low T4 levels have been reported in people who were previously stabilized on levothyroxine and then started taking celery seed tablets. They presented with symptoms such as lethargy, bloating, and dry skin, and recovered when celery seed was stopped (10646).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nSymptoms of celery allergy have included oral allergy syndrome, characterized by itching and burning in the mouth and throat (41159, 40977, 115301), and laryngeal edema (40953).\nless\nImmunologic\nRaw celery, cooked celery, and celery juice can all cause allergic reactions (40908, 40926, 41118, 41131, 92852, 92855, 115301). Symptoms of celery allergy include laryngeal edema, skin reactions, nasal congestion and discharge, an urticaria-edema-anaphylactic shock syndrome, celery-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and anaphylactic shock (40953, 41100, 41102, 41107, 41115, 41124, 41129, 41135, 41137, 92852)(92855, 115301). Additionally, in clinical research, itchy throat has been reported in individuals taking celery seed powder (112410).\n\nThere is a case report of anaphylactic shock involving hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea in a patient who had ingested raw celery 15 minutes prior to symptom onset. The patient was treated with epinephrine, dexamethasone, and antazoline (92855). Another case report describes a patient with positive skin prick tests to celery, pollens including birch, chrysanthemum, mugwort, and ragweed, and to dust mites. When celery was consumed 30 minutes prior to exercise, the patient had an anaphylactic reaction that required treatment with intravenous pheniramine and corticosteroid, as well as nebulized albuterol (92852). Additionally, a patient with a history of shortness of breath and cough after consuming a spice mixture containing dried celery had a positive food challenge with 15 grams of cooked celery mixed with different ingredients to mask the taste. The patient's reaction included wheezing, tachycardia, and itching, and treatment required intravenous dexamethasone and clemastinum and intramuscular epinephrine. Notably, prior to the food challenge, the patient had a negative skin prick test to food allergens including celery, but an inhibition assay confirmed cross-sensitivity to mugwort(115301). Another patient with a history of anaphylactic reactions to undeclared celery in restaurant meals was able to undergo desensitization with gradually increasing oral doses of celery juice over several months, and then chronic daily ingestion of the juice to maintain hyposensitization (40908).\nless",

Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis has also been reported in patients with \"celery-mugwort-birch-spice\" syndrome after consuming celery prior to exercise (41100, 41124, 92852). Patients with this syndrome may also be at increased risk for oseltamivir-associated hypersensitivity reactions, although additional research is needed to confirm this (92853).\nless\nTHYROID DISORDERS\nTheoretically, celery might increase or decrease thyroid levels in patients with thyroid disorders. Until more is known, use with caution or avoid celery in patients being treated for thyroid disorders. Celery has been associated with case reports of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (10646, 102912, 102914).\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of celery.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of celery are the fruit, seed, root, leaves, and stems (18). Celery contains sedanolide, limonene, myrcene, beta-pinene, p-cymene, thymol, linanool, alpha-selinene, beta-selinene, alpha-terpineol, carveol, dihydrocarvone, apiogenin, apiumoside, geranyl acetate, phthalides, flavonoids (graveobioside, apiin, isoquercitrin, leuteolin-7-O-apiosyl glucoside, chrysoeriol glucoside), furocoumarins (bergaptene, celereodise, isoimperatorin, isopimpinellin, xanthotoxin), caffeic acid derivatives (chlorogenic acid), and polyynes (falcarinol, falcarindiol) (6, 18, 112410). Celery is a rich source of calcium, magnesium, and iron (19). It is also a good source of antioxidant nutrients including vitamin C, riboflavin, vitamin B6, pantothenic acid, beta-carotene, and manganese (102912).\nAntibacterial effects\nCelery seed oil has shown bacteriostatic effects (4). Traditionally, celery has been used for urinary tract infections (UTIs). In vitro evidence shows that celery fruit extract reduces the adhesive capabilities of Escherichia coli, a bacterium that can cause UTI. Additional research shows that giving celery fruit extract orally to mice reduces the severity of experimentally-induced UTI (99571). A study in rats infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) suggests that administering celery seed extract 4 mg/kg for 7 days clears bacteremia, but not at doses of 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg (110754).\nAntigout effects\nCelery seed oil and an aqueous extract of the seeds can reduce levels of uric acid and xanthine oxidase in mice with hyperuricemia. In rats with acute gouty arthritis induced by injection of urate crystals into the joints, both extracts reduce inflammation and inflammatory cell infiltration around the joints. The extracts reduce levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1-beta (IL-1B) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and increase levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 (102913).\nAntioxidant effects\nCelery seed oil and aqueous seed extracts have antioxidant effects in mice. They reduce levels of reactive oxygen species and increase serum levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. These antioxidant effects may be due to flavonoids present in celery (102913).\nHepatoprotective effects\nSome animal research shows that pretreatment with celery root extract protects against acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure, possibly due to celery's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (106487).\nNeurologic/CNS\nSedative and antispasmodic effects of celery seed may be due to phthalide constituents (d-limonene, selinene, and related phthalides) (4, 6).\nRenal effects\nThe reported diuretic effects of celery seed may be due to phthalide constituents, including d-limonene, selinene, and related phthalides (4, 6). The essential oil of celery seed can increase kidney inflammation by irritating epithelial tissue (8). Conversely, in rabbits with hemorrhagic cystitis due to ifosfamide, administering celery seed with mesna increased antioxidant levels, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-alfa), and attenuated bladder tissue damage when compared with rabbits not given celery seed and mesna (110748). However, it is unclear whether the combination of celery seed and mesna is more beneficial than mesna alone.\nVasorelaxant effects\nAnimal research shows that celery seed extract has vasorelaxant effects, possibly through inhibition of calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells (105800).\nWeight effects\nA study in mice fed a high-fat diet suggests that administering fermented or unfermented celery juice 10 g/kg daily for 12 weeks attenuates weight gain, fat accumulation, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia when compared with mice not given celery juice. Effects with fermented celery juice were more than unfermented celery juice, possibly due to higher polyphenol, flavonoid, and vitamin C content (110747)."

Researchers also hypothesize that cetyl myristoleate and other cetylated fatty acids might have surfactant effects. These fatty acids might cause lubrication of joints and muscles, softening of tissues, and increased pliability. It is thought that they might also be a modulator of the immune system and a mediator of inflammatory process. Another proposed mechanism of action is possible inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase, mediators of inflammation (8924, 12076, 97251). In macrophage cells in vitro, cetylated fatty acids reduce the production of inflammatory mediators. Also, cetylated fatty acids induce chondrogenesis.

            "Overview": "Ceylon cinnamon is the bark of a tropical evergreen tree which grows in Sri Lanka, southern India, and Madagascar. Sri Lanka provides more than 80% of the world's supply of this type of cinnamon (92072, 108260). Ceylon cinnamon is one of many types of cinnamon that is commonly sold and marketed as 'cinnamon'; however, cassia cinnamon, which contains higher levels of the hepatotoxic compound coumarin, is the most common type found in North America (108260).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods. Ceylon cinnamon has Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status in the US for use as a spice or flavoring agent (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts. Ceylon cinnamon 0.5-3 grams daily has been safely used in studies lasting up to 6 months (4, 12, 97248, 97250, 99874). ...when used as a mouth rinse for up to 15 days (92071).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Ceylon cinnamon when used orally in greater amounts or for longer periods. Ceylon cinnamon contains trace amounts of coumarin (108260). In very high doses, coumarin can cause hepatotoxicity (15302). However, since the amount of coumarin in Ceylon cinnamon is negligible, it is unlikely to cause toxic effects (89652, 92072, 92073).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods (4912).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in amounts greater than those found in foods. Fetal abnormalities have been reported in animals (4, 12).\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods (4912). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Ceylon cinnamon in amounts greater than those found in foods.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Ceylon cinnamon is generally well tolerated, and adverse reactions are uncommon.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Bloating, dyspepsia, nausea.\n\nTopically: Allergic dermatitis, irritation of mucous membranes and skin.\nDermatologic\nOrally, a case of systemic contact dermatitis has been reported in a patient who consumed cinnamon (type not specified) after being previously sensitized to cinnamyl alcohol via cutaneous exposure (95599). In a small study of oral Ceylon cinnamon, two patients reported itching (104520). In another small study, two patients reported rashes (108263).\n\nTopically, cinnamon oil can cause skin irritation and allergic dermatitis, probably due to cinnamaldehyde which makes up 60% to 80% of cinnamon oil (2537, 12635, 92071, 95596, 95599). In one case report, a 16-year-old female experienced worsening dermatitis after using a homemade facial scrub containing cinnamon powder (type not specified). Symptoms improved after discontinuation of the scrub (95596). Several cases of intraoral allergic contact dermatitis have been reported in patients consuming cinnamon (type not specified) or using products containing constituents of cinnamon (95598).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, gastrointestinal side effects such as heartburn, nausea, bloating, and dyspepsia have been reported (97250).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, a case of postoperative hemorrhage is reported in a 49-year-old patient after taking Ceylon cinnamon 1 tablespoon daily for 10 months. One day post-colectomy, the patient had an INR of 1.59 and intraabdominal bleeding that required exploratory laparotomies, blood transfusion, and fresh frozen plasma. Ultimately, the patient was discharged (112421).\nless\nHepatic\nWhile there is concern about the coumarin content in cassia cinnamon increasing the risk for hepatic adverse effects and bleeding, the amount of coumarin in Ceylon cinnamon is negligible and unlikely to cause toxic effects (89652, 92072, 92073). In one case report, a 73-year-old female taking rosuvastatin for several months developed elevated liver function tests (LFTs), abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting after taking cinnamon (unknown dose and type) for 7 days. The acute hepatitis and elevated LFTs resolved after stopping both cinnamon and rosuvastatin. The patient was later able to resume rosuvastatin without recurrence (97249).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Most research shows that oral Ceylon cinnamon does not benefit patients with type 2 diabetes.\nClinical research in adults with well-controlled type 2 diabetes shows that taking Ceylon cinnamon 1-9 grams orally daily for 2-3 months does not improve fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo or a control group (99436, 99437, 99439). However, one small clinical study in adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes despite treatment with metformin showed a trend toward improvement in fasting blood glucose. Taking Ceylon cinnamon 3 grams daily for 8 weeks reduced fasting blood glucose by 12 mg/dL, compared with an increase of 9 mg/dL in those taking placebo. Although this difference was not statistically significant, the study might not have been adequately powered to show a difference. Also, the 8-week duration of this study was too short to reliably assess the effect of Ceylon cinnamon on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (99438). Conversely, a large study clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes conducted in India shows that taking Ceylon cinnamon 1.5 grams daily for 4 months improves fasting blood glucose by 40 mg/dL and HbA1c by 1% when compared with placebo but does not significantly improve either outcome when compared to baseline (112422). However, it is unclear whether modifications to diabetes medications were allowed during the study.\nless\nObesity. Preliminary clinical research suggests that oral Ceylon cinnamon does not help with weight loss.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that drinking black tea steeped with 3 grams of Ceylon cinnamon dried powder three times daily for 8 weeks does not affect weight, waist circumference, or blood pressure when compared with baseline or black tea alone in overweight patients with diabetes (95597). Other preliminary research shows that taking Ceylon cinnamon, titrated up from 85 mg to 500 mg, daily for 3 months has no effect on weight or body mass index, but may reduce hip circumference by 1.8 cm, when compared with baseline in healthy, mostly normal weight adults (97250).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). A nasal spray containing a Ceylon cinnamon extract might improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis. It is unclear if oral Ceylon cinnamon is beneficial.\nUsing a nasal spray containing a polyphenol-rich standardized extract of Ceylon cinnamon 1 mg/mL, twice daily in each nostril for 7 days, reduces the severity of nasal, eye, and nocturnal symptoms, and improves quality of life and work productivity when compared with placebo in people with seasonal allergic rhinitis who are not using any other medications for the condition (103169).\n\nOne small clinical study in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis shows that taking a specific combination product (ClearGuard, Access Business Group LLC) containing Ceylon cinnamon extract, acerola fruit concentrate, and powdered Spanish needles (Bidens pilosa) orally, 450 mg three times daily for 3 days, improves nasal symptoms 8 hours after, but not immediately following, a nasal allergen challenge when compared with placebo (23709).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Ceylon cinnamon has only been studied in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with COPD shows that taking a combination product containing extracts of Ceylon cinnamon, ginger, alpinia, cardamom, and saffron in honey 3 times daily for 8 weeks improves confidence in leaving home and the ratio of forced exploratory volume per second to forced vital capacity of the lungs (FEV1/FVC) when compared with placebo. However, the combination product does not improve most measures of respiratory function or symptoms such as cough, phlegm, chest tightness, dyspnea, reduced energy levels, sleeping disorders, or activity limitations when compared with placebo (111542). It is unclear if these effects are due to Ceylon cinnamon, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCommon cold. Although there has been interest in using oral Ceylon cinnamon for the common cold, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Ceylon cinnamon for this purpose.\nDenture stomatitis. It is unclear if topical Ceylon cinnamon is beneficial in patients with denture stomatitis.\nA small clinical trial in patients with denture stomatitis shows that using 10 mL of a mouthwash, as well as a denture spray, containing Ceylon cinnamon essential oil three times daily for 15 days modestly reduces Candida measurements and improves the severity of stomatitis in the oral mucosa and dentures when compared with baseline (108262). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral Ceylon cinnamon for diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Ceylon cinnamon for this purpose.\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral Ceylon cinnamon is beneficial in patients with dysmenorrhea.\nOne preliminary clinical trial in adults with primary dysmenorrhea shows that taking Ceylon cinnamon orally 1 gram three times daily during the first 72 hours of menstruation over the course of two cycles decreases pain by 1.6 points on a 10-point visual analog scale when compared with placebo (99875). The use of a per-protocol analysis limits the validity of these results.\nless\nDyspepsia. It is unclear if oral Ceylon cinnamon is beneficial in patients with dyspepsia.\nA small clinical trial in patients with functional dyspepsia shows that taking one capsule of Ceylon cinnamon oil, providing an unspecified dose, three times daily for 6 weeks does not improve symptoms of dyspepsia when compared with sesame oil as placebo (108263).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral Ceylon cinnamon is beneficial in patients with prehypertension.\nA small clinical trial in patients with prehypertension shows that taking Ceylon cinnamon 500 mg three times daily for 90 days does not affect final blood pressure measurements when compared with placebo. However, there was a modest reduction in mean daytime systolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (108261).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Although there has been interest in using oral Ceylon cinnamon for impaired glucose tolerance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Ceylon cinnamon for this purpose.\nInfluenza. Although there has been interest in using oral Ceylon cinnamon for influenza, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Ceylon cinnamon for this purpose.\nIntestinal parasite infection. Although there has been interest in using oral Ceylon cinnamon for intestinal parasite infection, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Ceylon cinnamon for this purpose.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral Ceylon cinnamon has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of powdered Ceylon cinnamon 1.5 grams, dried bilberry fruit 10 grams, slippery elm bark 4.5 grams, and agrimony 3 grams orally twice daily for 3 weeks increases the number of bowel movements and reduces symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and straining in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (35462).\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral Ceylon cinnamon is beneficial in patients with migraine headache.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking Ceylon cinnamon powder orally 600 mg three times daily for 2 months, in addition to regular medications for migraine, decreases the frequency, severity, and duration of migraine attacks when compared with placebo (104520).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral Ceylon cinnamon is beneficial in patients with PCOS.\nTaking Ceylon cinnamon orally 1.5 grams daily for 3 months in adults with PCOS does not appear to improve fasting insulin levels, fasting glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin, testosterone, lipid parameters, body weight, or body mass index when compared with placebo (97248). However, a meta-analysis of 5 low-quality studies shows that taking Ceylon cinnamon 0.5-1.5 grams daily for 8 weeks to 1 year reduces insulin resistance and fasting serum insulin levels (104518).\n\nCeylon cinnamon has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Some preliminary clinical research in overweight adults with PCOS shows that taking three tablets of a combination product containing extracts of Ceylon cinnamon, licorice root, peony root, and St. John's wort, providing the equivalent of 750 mg of dried herb for each ingredient, daily for 3 months, plus tribulus extract for 10 days during the follicular phase, in conjunction with lifestyle modification reduces the time between periods by around 43 days when compared with lifestyle modification alone. The rate of conception was four times higher with this combination when compared with control (97216). Another small clinical study shows that taking a mixture of Ceylon cinnamon, spearmint, ginger, and sweet orange daily for 3 months, in addition to clomiphene citrate for 5 days of each menstrual cycle, improves serum antioxidant levels, fasting blood glucose, and serum insulin levels when compared with clomiphene citrate alone. It is unclear whether these changes are associated with an increase in ovulation and pregnancy rates (103168). In both studies, it is unclear if the effects are related to Ceylon cinnamon, other ingredients, or to the combinations used.\nless\nPremature ejaculation. Topical Ceylon cinnamon has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with premature ejaculation, applying a multi-ingredient cream (SS Cream) containing Panax ginseng root, Angelica root, Cistanches deserticola, Zanthoxyl species, Torlidis seed, clove flower, Asiasari root, Ceylon cinnamon, and toad venom to the glans penis one hour prior to intercourse and washing off immediately before intercourse improves ejaculatory latency when compared with placebo (2537). The effects of Ceylon cinnamon alone are unclear.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Ceylon cinnamon for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nThe most common dose of Ceylon cinnamon is 3 grams daily in divided doses. It has also been used in doses of 1-9 grams daily for 2-3 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nTopical:\nCeylon cinnamon has been used in a nasal spray and mouthwash. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nA nasal spray formulation containing 1 mg/mL Ceylon cinnamon extract was standardized to contain not less than 40 mcg total polyphenols (103169). In one clinical trial, Ceylon cinnamon oil provided cinnamaldehyde at 2 mg/gram (108263).",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nLarge doses of Ceylon cinnamon cause excitation of the central nervous system, tachycardia, and increases in peristalsis, respiration, and sweating. This is sometimes followed by sedation (12).\n\nIngestion of 60 mL of an unspecified cinnamon oil by a 7-year-old child has been linked to vomiting and diarrhea, as well as dizziness, loss of consciousness, and sedation (13175).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with Ceylon cinnamon.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of Ceylon cinnamon.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Ceylon cinnamon is the bark. The volatile oils of Ceylon cinnamon are thought to contain the active constituents. Cinnamaldehyde makes up 60% to 80% of the volatile oil from the bark (4800, 95596). There are approximately 6 to 30 grams/kg of cinnamaldehyde in Ceylon cinnamon (3919). Ceylon cinnamon also contains mucilage, tannin, calcium oxalate, amidone, sugars, cinnamomin, and resin (104519).\nAnti-allergic effects\nPolyphenols in Ceylon cinnamon bark extract are reported to suppress immunoglobulin E antibody formation, and to inhibit mast cell degranulation and histamine release. The bark extract also reduces the activity of cytokines and interleukins that play a role in inflammation (103169).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nA pooled analysis of six clinical studies shows that Ceylon cinnamon decreases levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, when compared with placebo, suggesting that Ceylon cinnamon has anti-inflammatory effects and may confer benefit in conditions associated with elevated CRP levels, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obesity, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), among others (99874).\nAntibacterial effects\nCinnamaldehyde is the major essential oil found in Ceylon cinnamon and is believed to be responsible for its antibacterial effects. It is suggested that Ceylon cinnamon essential oils disrupt bacterial cell membranes, leading to ion leakage (92074). Trans-cinnamaldehyde has also been shown to inhibit acetyl-coA carboxylase in bacteria (92070). In vitro research shows that Ceylon cinnamon has activity against the following organisms: Acinetobacter baumannii, A. lwoffii, Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Brucella melitensis, Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumonia, Listeria ivanovii, L. monocytogenes, Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. tuberculosis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Salmonella typhi, S. typhimurium, Staphylococcus albus, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Yersinia enterocolitica (92072). Additionally, anecdotal reports of Ceylon cinnamon preventing microbiological relapse in infants chronically infected with Salmonella enteritidis have been published (13216, 92081).\nAntidiabetic effects\nSome in vitro and animal research suggests that Ceylon cinnamon has antidiabetic effects. In vitro, Ceylon cinnamon has been shown to lower post-prandial glucose absorption, enhance cellular glucose uptake, improve glucose metabolism and glycogen synthesis, inhibit gluconeogenesis, and stimulate insulin release. Cinnamtannin B1, a compound found in Ceylon cinnamon, is thought to be responsible for these effects (92078). Other in vitro research suggests that the Ceylon cinnamon constituent methylhydroxychalcone polymer (MHCP) might improve insulin sensitivity. It seems to mimic the activity of insulin, stimulating glucose metabolism. It also appears to work synergistically with insulin, possibly by improving insulin signaling pathways and alternative pathways that cause increased cellular glucose uptake (11247, 11248, 11973). An in vitro study suggests that Ceylon cinnamon may inhibit expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, which is involved in insulin signaling and associated with overexpression in some individuals with type 2 diabetes (112422). Additionally, animal research suggests that Ceylon cinnamon might improve weight loss, blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin levels, and blood lipids in patients with diabetes (92078). Despite these results, research in animals also shows that cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) has a greater insulin-stimulating effect than Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) (13238).\nAntifungal effects\nSome research suggests that Ceylon cinnamon may have antifungal effects. In humans, a case series suggests that taking lozenges containing Ceylon cinnamon for one week might improve oral candidiasis in some patients with HIV (23707). In vitro research shows that Ceylon cinnamon has activity against the following fungi: Aspergillus flavus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. ochraceus, A. parasiticus, A. terreus, Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Epidermophyton floccosum, Histoplasma capsulatum, Malassezia furfur, Microsporum audouinii, M. canis, M. gypseum, Trichophyton mentagraphytes, T. rubrum, and T. tonsurans (92072). The mechanism of Ceylon cinnamon's antifungal effects is unclear; however, cinnamaldehyde may be responsible (4).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro and human research shows that Ceylon cinnamon extracts have antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties. These might be associated with phenolic constituents (92072).\nAntiparasitic effects\nSome preliminary research in animals shows that Ceylon cinnamon oil protects susceptible hosts from infection with Cryptosporidium parvum (92082). The mechanism of this effect is unclear, but may involve phenolic compounds.\nAntiviral effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that Ceylon cinnamon may have activity against human rotavirus (92083).\nBone effects\nSome preliminary in vitro research shows that Ceylon cinnamon extract inhibits the formation of osteoclast-like cells through downregulation of NFATc1, suggesting that Ceylon cinnamon might have beneficial effects in osteopenia (92084).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome animal research shows that Ceylon cinnamon extract has vasorelaxant properties and improves blood pressure in rat models of hypertension, possibly via inhibition of calcium influx through L-type voltage-sensitive channels (92085, 92086). Some research also shows that Ceylon cinnamon can lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in diabetic and hyperlipidemic animal models and preliminary clinical research (92087, 92088, 108261). Other research is conflicting (46881). The mechanism for Ceylon cinnamon's purported lipid effects is unclear, but may be due to dietary fiber from Ceylon cinnamon reducing lipid absorption, enhanced lipid metabolism via Ceylon cinnamon's antioxidant effects, or cinnamon-induced increases in insulin levels leading to enhanced lipid metabolism (92072).\nCytotoxic effects\nIn vitro research shows that some Ceylon cinnamon extracts have cytotoxic effects on certain cancer cell lines (92090, 92091).\nDermatological effects\nSome preliminary in vitro research shows that Ceylon cinnamon extract enhances collagen synthesis in dermal fibroblasts, suggesting that it might have anti-aging effects on skin (92092).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSome preliminary animal research shows that Ceylon cinnamon decreases gastric acid secretion and has antiulcer activity in rats (92093). Other animal research shows that Ceylon cinnamon 100-200 mg/kg reduces diarrhea in rats with magnesium sulfate-induced diarrhea (92094). The tannin constituents in Ceylon cinnamon bark have astringent properties and are thought to be responsible for the antidiarrheal effect (4). Ceylon cinnamon is also reported to have prebiotic effects, contributing to the growth, proliferation, and function of probiotic organisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus (104519).\nHepatoprotective effects\nSome preliminary animal research suggests that Ceylon cinnamon may have hepatoprotective effects. In a rat model of liver damage, pretreatment with Ceylon cinnamon extract 0.01-0.1 gram/kg for 28 days significantly reduced carbon tetrachloride-induced liver toxicity (92095).\nInsecticidal activity\nSome preliminary research suggests that Ceylon cinnamon oil is more effective than leaf oil for killing certain mosquito species, including Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles tessellatus, and Aedes aegypti (92096). Other research shows that Ceylon cinnamon oil has activity against female head lice and louse eggs, being slightly less effective than the conventional treatment options d-phenothrin and pyrethrum (92097).\nNeurological effects\nSome preliminary animal research suggests that Ceylon cinnamon might improve cognitive function and have neuroprotective properties, likely via antioxidant effects. Rats given Ceylon cinnamon extract 200-400 mg/kg daily for 21 days showed significant improvements in scopolamine-induced cognitive decline compared to control (92026). Additionally, in vitro research shows that Ceylon cinnamon extract inhibits tau aggregation and filament formation, suggesting that Ceylon cinnamon might delay the progression of Alzheimer disease (92098).\nWound healing effects\nSome animal research suggests that both oral and topical administration of Ceylon cinnamon improves wound healing in rat models (92099, 93000)."

            "Overdose": "The toxic effects of Ceylon leadwort have been examined in animal research. The median lethal dose of Ceylon leadwort root extracts range from 93 mg/kg to 928 mg/kg, depending on the type of extract. Extracts with the highest levels of plumbagin are the most toxic. The liver and kidney are the primary affected organs (92329). A plumbagin-free alcohol extract of Ceylon leadwort root had both anti-implantation and abortifacient activity at 300 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg orally. This was likely due to alterations in sex hormones, including progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin. The extract had anti-estrogenic activity when given in combination with estrogen (92328).\n\nWhen Ceylon leadwort root extract was applied topically in animals, overt toxic effects were lacking (92327).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animals, the bioavailability of plumbagin after oral administration of Ceylon leadwort is approximately 39% (92359).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nAlthough all parts of the Ceylon leadwort plant, including stem, leaves, flowers, and seeds, are used medicinally, the roots are most commonly used. Plumbagin, a naphthoquinone constituent of Ceylon leadwort, is found throughout the plant in low levels, with the highest levels occurring in the roots. Other constituents in Ceylon leadwort root include plumbagin derivatives, other naphthoquinones, zeylinone, and droserone, as well as sterols, coumarins, alkaloids, triterpenoids, and flavonoids (92322, 92323, 92333, 92334, 92335, 92336).\nAnti-cancer effects\nCeylon leadwort extracts and constituents have been shown to have anti-cancer effects in numerous in vitro and animal models (92323). The constituent plumbagin has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth and invasion and promote apoptosis. In animal research, this constituent has been shown to reduce tumor volume (92323). Plumbagin might also be benficial in inhibiting the growth and invasion of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells (92341). It appears that plumbagin inhibits the inflammatory pathway starting with the activation of various cancer-signalling proteins, including transcription factor NF-kappa B and STAT3. Plumbagin also seems to stimulate reactive oxygen species, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide, which play a role in apoptosis (92322, 92342, 92343, 92344, 92345, 92346, 92347).\n\nIn animal research, topical application of plumbagin has also demonstrated anti-cancer effects on the skin, protecting against ultraviolet light by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis (92345).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCeylon leadwort is traditionally used orally and topically for inflammation and swelling. Animal models have shown that Ceylon leadwort root and leaf extracts, as well as the constituent plumbagin, reduce swelling and inflammation, likely by reducing inflammatory mediators, when administered orally or topically (92322, 92352, 92353, 93254).\nAntibacterial effects\nCeylon leadwort is traditionally used for gastric ulcers and skin diseases. Ceylon leadwort, as well as its plumbagin and isoshinanolone derivative constituents, have demonstrated broad antibacterial effects against Helicobacter pylori and other bacteria in laboratory research (92322, 92323, 92356). Ceylon leadwort extract also appears to have anti-bacterial effects against some multi-drug resistant enteric bacteria and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as synergistic effects with some antibiotics (92322, 92323, 92337, 92338). The antibacterial effects of Ceylon leadwort may be related to membrane disruption, resulting in increased membrane permeabilization and leakage of cellular contents (92339). In animals, plumbagin appears to increase the bactericidal effects of macrophages by promoting oxygen radical release. However, this process might be concentration-dependent (92340).\nAntidiabetic effects\nCeylon leadwort root is traditionally used for diabetes. However, the effects of Ceylon leadwort on glucose regulation are unclear and are based on laboratory research. In animal research, Ceylon leadwort root extract has been shown to increase blood glucose levels by reducing uptake from the blood (92331). However, in laboratory models of diabetes, Ceylon leadwort root extract has been shown to decrease blood levels of glucose by increasing its uptake into muscle (92348).\nAntifertility effects\nCeylon leadwort is used traditionally to reduce fertility or as an abortifacient. Laboratory research suggests that various parts of the Ceylon leadwort plant might affect fertility in both males and females. In a female animal model, leaf extracts are able to temporarily interrupt the estrous cycle, resulting in inhibition of ovulation (92350). In a male model, Ceylon leadwort root extract is able to reduce the production of sperm cells (92351).\nGastrointestinal effects\nCeylon leadwort root is traditionally used for gastric ulcers. This may be related to its antibacterial effects against Helicobacter pylori as well as its potential to reduce gastric damage in animal models (92322, 92356).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nIn animal research, Ceylon leadwort has demonstrated immunomodulatory effects, mainly related to immunosuppression (92323, 92357, 92358). It is not clear whether the immunomodulatory effects of Ceylon leadwort play a role in the reduction of disease-related symptoms, including inflammation. The constituent plumbagin appears to reduce activation of T cells and to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines. However, other constituents, including seselin, also appear to modify the activity of white blood cells. The mechanism of action appears to be directly related to cell messaging mechanisms and not cytotoxicity (92323, 92352, 92357, 92358). Plumbagin also might stimulate immune function, especially the bactericidal effects of macrophages (92323).\nLipid effects\nCeylon leadwort root is traditionally used for cholesterol reduction. In animal research, both Ceylon leadwort root extract and the constituent plumbagin have been shown to reduce levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (92322).\nWound healing effects\nCeylon leadwort is traditionally used for skin complaints. In animal research, Ceylon leadwort root extract promotes wound healing; constituent alkaloids, terpenoids, and flavonoids were thought to play a role in this effect (92322)."

An extract of dried leaves contains long-chain hydrocarbons, long-chain alcohols, spathulenol, beta-sitosterol, and various fatty acids, including palmitic, myristic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic (93250). The fruit contains caffeine, potassium salts, allantoin, and allantoic acid (93250, 94202).\nAntiviral effects\nAn extract prepared from Cha de Bugre leaves and twigs has demonstrated viricidal activity against the herpes simplex virus in vitro (93249).\nDiuretic effects\nCha de Bugre has been traditionally used as a diuretic.

In healthy rats and in diabetic rats with hypertriglyceridemia, Cha de Bugre leaf extract lowered serum triglyceride levels (94201).\nWeight loss effects\nCha de Bugre is thought to facilitate weight loss by reducing appetite (94201). However, animal research has yielded conflicting evidence. Cha de Bugre extract 300-1000 mg/kg daily for 7 days increased weight loss only in female mice receiving 600 mg/kg/day (93247). In other studies, Cha de Bugre leaf extract 20-2000 mg/kg daily for 13-15 days had no effect on food intake or body weight in any mice (93248, 94201). In rats, Cha de Bugre whole plant extract 400 mg/kg daily for 90 days slowed the rate of weight gain, but lower doses had no effect (94202)."

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nThere are at least three known cases of kidney toxicity associated with large intakes of chaga powder, which contains high concentrations of oxalate. A 75-year-old Japanese female with liver cancer developed irreversible kidney failure requiring dialysis after taking 4-5 teaspoons of chaga powder daily for 6 months. Renal biopsy showed diffuse tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, with oxalate crystals in the tubular lamina and urinary sediment (96566). A 49-year-old Korean male with intractable atopic dermatitis also developed kidney failure after taking chaga powder 3 grams daily for 4 years followed by 9 grams daily for one year. Biopsy showed chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis with oxalate crystals. Analysis of the chaga powder used found 0.14 grams oxalate per gram chaga powder, or an intake of 420 mg or 1260 mg oxalate daily. These intakes are considered moderate to high (105246). Also, a 69-year-old male taking chaga mushroom powder (Korea Ginseng Co) 10-15 grams daily for 3 months was diagnosed with acute oxalate nephropathy with features of nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy showed focal tubular injury, calcium oxalate crystals in renal tubules, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy (108756).\nTreatment\nIn one case of kidney failure associated with chaga, the patient had been on maintenance hemodialysis for 18 months at time of publication (105246). In one case of acute oxalate nephropathy, the patient recovered after treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and 1 month of hemodialysis (108756).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of chaga.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nChaga is a fungus that contains flavonoids, triterpenoids, sterols, polysaccharides, melanins and other pigments, inhibitors of melanin formation, and polyphenols, including inonoblins and phelligridins (25892, 25893, 25894, 25895, 25896, 25897, 25898, 25899, 25900, 26232)(26233, 26234, 26235, 26236, 26237, 26238, 26239, 26240, 26241, 111927). Chaga also has a high oxalate content of 2.8-11.2 grams per 100 grams of chaga powder (96566).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that oral chaga extract can reduce carrageenan-induced paw edema and pain in rats. This effect has been attributed to the ability of chaga to inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by down-regulating the binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) (26254). In an animal model of endometritis, chaga extract reduces uterine inflammation, possibly by inhibiting this same pathway and reducing levels of inflammatory compounds such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-1 beta (111922). In animal models, the anti-inflammatory effects of chaga were found to be associated with a modification of the gut microflora and related metabolism, as well as improvement in the intestinal barrier (111924, 111927).\nAnticancer effects\nIn mice, chaga extract prolonged the survival rate and had an effect on various types of cancer (26242, 26243). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that chaga extract has antitumor (25898, 26235, 26238, 26239, 26244, 26245, 26246, 26250), antimutagenic (25888), antiproliferative (25889), apoptotic (26247), and antimitotic effects (26248, 26249, 26250) against various types of cancer cell lines. Although the anticancer mechanisms for chaga are not entirely clear, proposed mechanisms of action include suppressing NF-kappaB activation; preventing the inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA); disturbing mitoses by elevating the number of mitotic cells in metaphase; inactivating ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase; and suppressing the expression of TNF-induced and NF-kappaB-regulated proliferative, antiapoptotic, and metastatic gene products (26251, 26252). In vitro research also suggests that chaga extract can reduce the activity of various enzymes, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), malic dehydrogenase (MDH), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (26250), which are involved in tumor initiation, metabolism, and other processes. In addition, in vitro evidence suggests that change increases the activity of catalase in some cancer cell lines, (26248, 26250). Also, it has been suggested that nitric oxide (NO) production by tumor cells may increase the invasiveness of these cells (26178). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that chaga can inhibit nitric oxide production in a human fibrosarcoma cell line (25889).\nAntidiabetic effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that administering chaga to alloxan-induced diabetic mice for 21 days reduces blood glucose levels by up to 31% and improves insulin sensitivity. In addition, chaga treatment appears to restore damaged pancreatic, kidney, liver, and colon tissue in these animals (26253, 111924, 111925, 111926, 111927). Although the mechanism of action is unclear, in animal models the anti-inflammatory effects of chaga were found to be associated with a modification of the gut microflora and related metabolism, as well as improvement in the intestinal barrier (111924, 111927). Also, an exercise model suggests that chaga extract stimulates liver glycogen formation, suggesting a role for increased uptake of glucose from the blood (111923).\nAntioxidant effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that chaga can increase catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities, as well as decrease malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in diabetic mice (26253). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that chaga can reduce hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage in human lymphocytes (26255, 26256). Various extracts of chaga have also exhibited antioxidant activity towards numerous free radicals (25888, 26233, 26238, 26257, 26258) and have inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production (26258). The superoxide and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity of chaga extract appears to be stronger than that of other fungi, including agaricus mushroom, reishi mushroom, and Phellinus linteus (meshima or black hoof mushroom) (26259). Although the antioxidant mechanisms for chaga are not entirely clear, a proposed mechanism involves inhibiting nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/IkappaB pathway and inhibiting the activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) (26258).\nCardiovascular effects\nEvidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that chaga extract can inhibit platelet aggregation (26260).\nImmune effects\nEvidence from in vitro research suggests that the mycelial endopolysaccharide of chaga can enhance the proliferation and polyclonal IgM antibody production in B cells and can enhance nitrite production and expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in macrophages (26263).\nLipid-modulating effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that chaga can reduce serum levels of free fatty acids (FFA), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in diabetic and hyperlipidemic animals (26253, 111924, 111925, 111927, 111928). In an animal model, the hypolipidemic effects of chaga were found to be associated with modifications of cholesterol metabolizing enzymes in the liver as well as changes in the gut microflora (111928).\nRadioprotective effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that administering a water extract of chaga orally can slow the development of leukopenia and increase survival duration of mice exposed to extended gamma radiation (26262)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Although some research disagrees, most clinical research shows that taking chanca piedra might improve clearance and decrease the size of kidney stones. However, it seems that disease severity, stone location, and chanca piedra dose and/or formulation may alter the likelihood of benefit.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with kidney stones shows that taking a specific chanca piedra product (Uriston) 2 grams orally daily for up to 3 months after undergoing 1-3 extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy sessions increases clearance of kidney stones within 30-60 days by 1-2 times that of control (41224). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with kidney stones smaller than 10 mm also shows that drinking a chanca piedra tea, prepared with 4.5 grams of dried extract in 250 mL boiled water, twice daily for 12 weeks decreases the number of kidney stones by 38% and kidney stone size by 40% when compared with baseline (99849). However, a small clinical trial in adults with kidney stones failed to demonstrate beneficial effects from chanca piedra extract 450 mg three times daily orally for 3 months (41202). Some subgroup and other analyses also suggest that chanca piedra may be more effective in patients with hyperoxaluria or hyperuricosuria at baseline or those with smaller kidney stones of less than 6 mm or 10 mm (41224, 99849, 102692).\n\nChanca piedra has also been evaluated in combination therapies. Preliminary clinical research shows that, in patients taking chanca piedra leaf extract 225 mg with magnesium stearate 152 mg and vitamin B6 2 mg twice daily for 3 months, stone-free status occurs in about 55% of patients with middle or upper kidney stones and about 14% of those with lower stones when compared with baseline (102692). Additionally, a retrospective cohort study in adults with distal ureteric stones smaller than 10 mm shows that taking chanca piedra (dose not specified) in combination with boldo, spiny restharrow, and tamsulosin for up to 28 days increases stone expulsion rate and reduces stone expulsion time by about 3 days when compared with tamsulosin alone (115493). It is unclear if these effects are due to chanca piedra, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nHepatitis B. Most clinical research shows that oral chanca piedra is not effective for treating hepatitis B.\nDespite preliminary clinical research suggesting that chanca piedra may be beneficial in patients with hepatitis B (41287), multiple follow-up clinical trials show that taking chanca piedra 200-900 mg three times daily for 1-6 weeks is not effective for treating hepatitis B, decreasing the duration of acute hepatitis B, or decreasing levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (3924, 3925, 41180, 41242, 41255, 41259, 41294, 41318).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAbdominal pain.

Oral chanca piedra has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with BPH, some of whom were already receiving treatment for their symptoms, shows that taking a specific product containing water-soluble extracts of chanca piedra, boldo, goldenrod, fireweed, and spiny restharrow (Fluxonorm, Omega Pharma) for 30 days improves lower urinary tract symptom scores by about 50% when compared with baseline. Maximum urinary flow rate and quality of life were also improved when compared with baseline (106432). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nColic. Although there has been interest in using oral chanca piedra for colic, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chanca piedra for this purpose.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral chanca piedra is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with types 2 diabetes shows that taking chanca piedra extract 12.5 grams orally twice daily for 7 days does not affect fasting or postprandial blood glucose levels when compared with baseline. The extract was prepared as 25 grams boiled in 200 mL of water (41186). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Oral chanca piedra has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in adults with diabetic sensory polyneuropathy shows that taking chanca piedra 9 grams of daily, in whole plant powder or extract form in combination, with sida cordifolia improves symptom scores, such as burning pain, numbness, and pricking pain when compared with placebo after 3 weeks. Chanca piedra whole plant powder and extract had comparable efficacy at 8 weeks (115494).

However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral chanca piedra is beneficial in patients with hypertension.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hypertension shows that taking chanca piedra 1.6 grams orally three times daily for 10 days does not reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with baseline (3928).

It is unclear if oral chanca piedra is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nA large clinical study conducted in Malaysia in adults with mild-to-moderate NAFLD shows that taking a standardized extract of chanca piedra (Hepar-P, Nova Laboratories, Malaysia) 3000 mg daily for 12 months does not reduce measures of steatosis or liver enzymes when compared with placebo, but seems to improve measures of fibrosis (114011). However, this is a secondary endpoint, and it is unclear if there were appropriate statistical adjustments for multiple comparisons. Also, the lack of other positive outcomes in this study may be due to the possibility that recommended lifestyle changes obscured any benefit.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if topical chanca piedra is beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that topical application of a chanca piedra gel with phonophoresis once daily for 10 days reduces pain and improves function when compared with placebo gel. Pain was reduced by 78%, compared with a reduction of 44% in those using the placebo gel, and patients using chanca piedra were able to walk 62 meters farther in 6 minutes when compared with placebo gel (102691).\nless\nPremature ejaculation. Oral chanca piedra has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adults with premature ejaculation shows that taking a specific combination product containing chanca piedra, cardamom, vitamin B6, tribulus, tryptophan, thiamine, and winter savory (Eiacumev, Farmaceutica MEV) orally once daily for 3 months improves premature ejaculation severity scores and increases time to ejaculation when compared with sexual counseling. Time to ejaculation increased by around 30 seconds when compared with control (97016). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of randomization and placebo-control.\nless\nPruritus.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of chanca piedra.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nChanca piedra contains various constituents, including the lignans phyllanthin, hypophyllanthin, phyltetralin, hinokinin, lintetralin, niranthin, and nirtetralin (41237, 41359, 41346, 41360, 41361, 41362, 41364, 41291, 41363, 92963). Chanca piedra also contains amariin, 1-galloyl-2,3-dehydrohexahydroxydiphenyl (DHHDP)-glucose, brevifolin, repandusinic acid, gallic acid, geraniin, corilagin, phyllanthusiin D, rutin, carboxylic acid, and quercetin (41208, 41250, 41256, 41365, 41366, 41367, 41345, 41368). Other notable constituents in chanca piedra are ellagic acid, methyl brevifolin carboxylate, astragalin, nirurin, diosgenin, niruriside, gallocatechin, and niruriflavone (92963).\nAnalgesic effects\nChanca piedra has been used traditionally for its analgesic properties. Preliminary research suggests that corilagin, a tannin in Chanca piedra, decreases sensitivity to pain in mice and can be 20 times more potent than acetylsalicylic acid (92964).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal and in vitro research shows that chanca piedra inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators including interleukins, interferons, nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, prostaglandins, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (41193, 99848). Animal research shows that chanca piedra reduces paw edema caused by prostaglandin E1, carrageenan, bradykinin, and serotonin but not histamine (41340, 41197).\nAntidiabetic effects\nTraditionally, chanca piedra has been used to lower blood sugar in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes (3928). Preliminary research in animals shows that extracts of chanca piedra aerial parts reduce fasting blood sugar, postprandial glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (41303, 41304, 41305, 41306, 41307, 41319, 41280, 41226). Chanca piedra may lower blood sugar by inhibiting alpha-amylase. Alpha-amylase is an enzyme that breaks down ingested carbohydrates increasing the release of sugar into the blood steam (33555, 41279, 41280, 41194).\nAntimicrobial effects\nChanca piedra methanolic extracts have shown activity in vitro against both Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative bacteria (92961). Furthermore, preliminary research shows that chanca piedra extracts have antiplasmodial effects in vitro and in vivo (41208, 41239, 41205, 41341, 41325, 41182, 41284).\nAntineoplastic effects\nTraditionally chanca piedra has been used for cancer. Preliminary research suggests that spray-dried extracts of chanca piedra have cytotoxic effects against colorectal and hepatic cancer cells in vitro. The extract also seems to improve the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (92955, 92960).\n\nPreliminary research in animals shows that chanca piedra extract exhibits antitumor effects in various cancer models including breast, stomach and liver (41179, 41181, 41223, 41267, 41283, 41342, 41343). Potential mechanisms of action include increased p53 expression, downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, and antiangiogenic effects (41252, 41261, 41189, 99847). Preliminary research in mice shows that a methanolic extract of chanca piedra protects from cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity and does not interfere with cyclophosphamide's anticancer effects (41210).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of chanca piedra may play a role in its use for cancer and reducing inflammation. Chanca piedra tea seems to have modest antioxidant effects in humans (92959). Preliminary research in animals showed that the aqueous extract of chanca piedra increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes (41268). Preliminary laboratory research also shows that chanca piedra constituents reduce damage from free radicals (41250, 41366, 41376).\nAntiviral effects\nPreliminary research in woodchucks and mice suggests that chanca piedra extract inhibits the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase and decreases HBV and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) levels (41286, 41289, 41299). Preliminary laboratory research shows that chanca piedra extract can suppress gene expression and replication of HBsAg in vitro (41296, 41299). Chanca piedra extract also appears to inactivate and inhibit secretion of HBsAg (41292, 41298). However, chanca piedra extract did not inhibit the replication of HBV in ducks (41271, 41293, 41297). Further preliminary research shows that chanca piedra root extract impedes RNA polymerase and therefore inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in laboratory studies (41281, 41344). Additionally, preliminary research suggests that nirtetralin B, a lignin isolated from chanca piedra, appears to dose-dependently suppress hepatitis B antigens (92966).\n\nChanca piedra may also have activity against HIV. In vitro, the constituent niuriside, inhibits specific HIV-protein binding activity, but does not protect cells from acute HIV infection (3927). Additional preliminary research suggests that chanca piedra extract can prevent HIV replication by inhibiting HIV reverse transcriptase (41196, 41198, 41204, 41195).\nCardiovascular effects\nStudies in humans show that chanca piedra has hypotensive effects (3928). Preliminary research in animals shows that the aqueous extract of the leaves of chanca piedra has hypotensive effects possibly via vascular smooth muscle relaxation and inhibition of calcium ion channels (41245). Preliminary research shows that methyl brevifolincarboxylate isolated from the leaves of chanca piedra inhibits platelet aggregation in healthy individuals (41234). This compound also appears to have vasorelaxant effects against norepinephrine-induced contractions of rat aorta (41215).\n\nChanca piedra also seems to be able to lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting its synthesis in the liver, increasing excretion of fecal bile acids, and increasing the activity of an enzyme that transports cholesterol (41191).\nCholinergic effects\nThere is some postulation that chanca piedra can help with Alzheimer's disease. Preliminary research in mice shows that chanca piedra improves memory scores and reverses experimentally-induced amnesia (41345). Isocorilagin, a bioactive tannin in chanca piedra, seems to inhibit acetylcholinesterase in vitro, with three times the potency of the drug galanthamine (Razadyne) (92962). Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used in Alzheimer's disease because they slow the breakdown of acetylcholine and improve cholinergic transmission in the brain thereby alleviating some symptoms of dementia.\nDiuretic effects\nChanca piedra appears to have diuretic effects (41313, 99850). Some animal research suggests that the diuretic effects of chanca piedra are related, in part, to prostaglandin involvement (99850).\nGastrointestinal effects\nTraditionally, chanca piedra has been used for a number of gastrointestinal disorders such as constipation, dyspepsia, tenesmus, lack of appetite, and stomach ache. Preliminary research in animals suggests that chanca piedra protects against ethanol-induced gastric lesions, decreasing mortality, ulcers, and bleeding. It is possible that chanca piedra exhibits the protective effect due to its antioxidant activity (41197, 41348). Other preliminary research shows that chanca piedra extract decreases defecation frequency in castor oil-induced diarrhea by inhibiting intestinal transit (41184). Also, in isolated animal tissue, an extract from the related plant, Phyllanthus sellowianus, has antispasmodic activity which may help to alleviate gastrointestinal pains (3921). Finally, preliminary research in rats shows that chanca piedra extract protects against ethanol-induced ulcers possibly due to antioxidant effects (41238, 41247, 41350).\nHair loss\nChanca piedra may be beneficial for alopecia. Preliminary research suggests that chanca piedra petroleum ether extract applied on areas with testosterone-induced hair loss results in increased hair growth and follicular proliferation in rats. The extract appears to inhibit the type-2 5alpha-reductase enzyme similarly to finasteride (92965).\nHepatic effects\nChanca piedra extract seems to protect the liver from damage and inflammation induced by nimesulide, aflatoxin, carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, and ethanol (41217, 41220, 41229, 41258, 41263, 41309, 41310, 41311, 41351, 98846). The antioxidant effects of chanca piedra may explain its hepatoprotective effects (98846). Some animal research also suggests that chanca piedra protects against nonalcoholic fatty liver through regulation of adipocytokines, reduction of the expression of adipogenic genes, and antiangiogenic effects (99847). However, clinical research in adults with mild-to-moderate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease shows that taking chanca piedra extract 1500 mg twice daily for 12 months does not improve liver enzyme levels or markers of steatosis when compared with placebo (114011). Similarly, preliminary clinical research in adults with alcoholic hepatitis shows that taking chanca piedra extract 500 mg twice daily orally for 4 weeks does not improve markers of liver dysfunction, including liver transaminase levels, albumin levels, and international normalized ratio (INR), when compared with placebo (107946).\nProstate effects\nChanca piedra may have beneficial effects in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Preliminary research shows that chanca piedra extract decreases prostate weight and prostatic serum acid phosphatase levels in rats given testosterone undecoanate to stimulate prostatic hyperplasia (41400).\nChanca piedra may have beneficial effects in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Preliminary research shows that chanca piedra extract decreases prostate weight and prostatic serum acid phosphatase levels in rats given testosterone undecoanate to stimulate prostatic hyperplasia (41400).\nRenal effects\nChanca piedra translates to \"stone breaker\" in Spanish and has been used traditionally and in clinical studies to help with kidney stones (92963). Chanca piedra may interfere with the formation of kidney stones by reducing crystals aggregation and reducing crystal interaction with tubular cells (92958). Preliminary research in animals shows that chanca piedra extract reduces the number and weight of calculi when there is no previous calculus and changes the formation of existing calculi (41188, 41225). Chanca piedra also appears to reduce the deposition of calcium crystals in the kidneys possibly by inhibiting endocytosis of calcium oxalate (41178, 41274, 41276). Additional preliminary research in hyperuricemic animals suggests that phyllanthin, a lignan constituent of chanca piedra, reduces plasma uric acid levels possibly by increasing uric acid excretion and also by inhibiting xanthine oxidase inhibition (41227). Chanca piedra appears to have diuretic effects which may also aid in the clearance of kidney stones (41313, 99850).\n\nFurther preliminary research in animals shows that the aqueous chanca piedra leaf and seed extract protects against gentamicin- and acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity. It seemed to improve serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, and reduce tubulonephrosis (41248)."

Prescription chelation therapy products, either oral or parenteral, are used for the treatment of heavy metal toxicity, hypercalcemia, and other conditions following diagnosis using validated tests (108100, 108105, 108106). Prescription approvals differ between regulatory bodies worldwide. For example, oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and intravenous calcium disodium edetate (EDTA) are approved by the US FDA and in Europe for various heavy metal toxicities. Oral or intravenous 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) is also approved in Europe, but not by the US FDA (108098, 108099, 108105).\n\nThis monograph does not include information on the use of prescription chelation products for FDA-approved indications under the supervision of a healthcare professional.

Intravenously, EDTA can also cause thrombophlebitis (108099, 108103). Disodium EDTA, when given as a rapid infusion or highly concentrated solution, can cause hypocalcemia, severe cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory arrest, and death (15, 108102).\n\nThere are at least three case reports of intravenous chelation therapy-related hypocalcemia resulting in cardiac arrest. Two cases involved the use of disodium EDTA in children and one involved the unapproved use of an unknown type of EDTA over a 10- to 15-minute infusion in an adult (107700, 108095, 108096, 108097, 108105). At least in part because of these cases, disodium EDTA is no longer FDA-approved (108105). In a large clinical trial in patients with a previous myocardial infarction, the rate of hypocalcemia was 6.2% in patients given disodium EDTA, compared with 3.5% of those given placebo; however, disodium EDTA did not increase the risk of heart failure or death (94985).\nless\nDermatologic\nThere is a case report of Stevens-Johnson syndrome after two weeks of oral 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) chelation therapy in a child with chronic mercury exposure.

In one case report, a 57-year-old male presented with pruritus on the hands and feet, as well as urticaria and swelling of the face, following subcutaneous injection with a local anesthetic containing EDTA. Allergy to other ingredients in the anesthetic was ruled out, and intradermal and subcutaneous testing with calcium disodium EDTA confirmed the allergic response. The patient also reacted to radio-contrast medium containing EDTA (94992).\n\nTopically, application of EDTA in cosmetics, shampoos, and other products has rarely been reported to cause contact dermatitis (94992).\n\nOrally, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been associated with allergic reactions (108105).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIntravenously, disodium ethylenediamene tetraacetic acid (EDTA) can occasionally cause muscle cramps, back pains, muscle weakness, and myalgias (15).

It is unclear if oral or topical chelation therapy products are beneficial for autism spectrum disorder.\nVarious chelation therapy products have been investigated in clinical research. One preliminary clinical trial in children aged 3-8 years with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) 10 mg/kg three times daily as chelation therapy does not improve sociability, communication with speech or language, or general stereotypical behaviors when compared with placebo. The DMSA was taken for 3 days and then repeated up to 6 times, with 11 days off between treatment periods. Prior to the initiation of this phase of the study, all children received at least one 3-day round of chelation therapy to ensure the excretion of high amounts of heavy metals; however, heavy metal excretion was not compared between groups . Also, half of the children received topical glutathione for 7 days (21057, 108099, 108109).\n\nOther preliminary clinical research in children aged 3-9 years with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking a single dose of DMSA 10 mg/kg increases urinary excretion of cadmium, mercury, and lead. Taking DMSA monthly for 6 months improves overall behavior when compared with baseline. However, only specific behaviors, such as relating to people, imitation, and communication, were improved; other behaviors, including emotional, visual, auditory, or intellectual responses, were not improved (108110). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\n\nSmall clinical studies have also evaluated other chelation therapy products in children with autism spectrum disorder. These include rectal thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide (108111) and oral, intravenous, rectal, or topical 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) (108098).

However, there was no effect of EDTA on the risk of these individual endpoints. A sub-group analysis shows that the risk of this composite outcome is reduced by up to 41% in patients who also have diabetes, with no reduction in patients without diabetes (94983, 94985). Also, receiving just the multicomponent disodium EDTA chelation solution without oral high-dose vitamins does not reduce the risk of this composite outcome when compared with placebo, even in the subgroup of patients with diabetes (94986).

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nCALCIUM\nChelation therapy with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) might affect measurements of serum calcium. Serum calcium concentrations cannot be determined by colorimetric methods in patients receiving disodium EDTA due to chelation of a calcium disodium complex. Oxalate and other precipitation methods may also give falsely decreased levels when disodium EDTA is present (15).\nless\nPLATELET COUNT\nChelation therapy with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) might affect measurements of platelet count. EDTA is used as an anticoagulant in plasma samples. In a small number of patients, EDTA can cause an EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia. The platelets in the blood from these patients agglutinate and clump in a blood collection tube, due to the presence of antiplatelet antibodies, resulting in a decreased platelet count. In some people, this has resulted in the incorrect diagnosis of life-threatening platelet disorders despite the lack of any platelet disorder symptoms (94982, 94989, 94993). It appears that patients with EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia might be more likely to have an underlying disease or postoperative complications and/or be at increased risk for the development of an eosinophilic disorder (94989). Some cases of EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia resolved following recovery from an illness or surgery (94994, 94995). In order to differentiate between thrombocytopenia and EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia, all decreased platelet counts should be confirmed by peripheral blood smear or an alternative method of blood cell counting. Also, results should be confirmed using preheated tubes and/or different anticoagulants such as citrate, sodium oxalate, or heparin (94982, 94989, 94993, 94994). Although the mechanism behind EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia is not completely understood there appears to be a factor in serum that can increase its potential. This factor can cross the placenta and cause transient EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia in the blood from a neonate (94990).\nless",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nDisodium ethylenediamene tetraacetic acid (EDTA), when given as a rapid infusion or highly concentrated solution, can cause hypocalcemia, severe cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory arrest, and death. There are at least three case reports of intravenous chelation therapy-related hypocalcemia resulting in cardiac arrest. Two of the three cases involved the use of disodium EDTA in children and one involved the unapproved use of an unknown type of EDTA over a 10- to 15-minute infusion in an adult (15, 107700, 108095, 108096, 108097, 108102, 108105).\nTreatment\nHypocalcemia associated with use of disodium EDTA is usually treated with intravenous calcium gluconate and/or calcium chloride (108095).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nTransdermal 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS) does not appear to be absorbed (108098). In animal research, oral DMPS results in peak plasma levels in 30-45 minutes. In human research, DMPS remains in the plasma for up to 24 hours (108098).\nMetabolism\nEthylenediamene tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is not metabolized (5737).\nExcretion\nEDTA is eliminated in the urine. Excretion is decreased in those with kidney dysfunction (15, 5737). The calcium in calcium disodium EDTA is displaced by metal ions such as lead to form a soluble complex that is then excreted in the urine (15). In animal research, the plasma half-life of oral or intravenous DMPS is 43 minutes. In human and animal research, DMPS is excreted in the urine (108098).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nChelation therapy products are agents that bind metal ions (108099, 108102, 108105, 108107). The most common chelation therapy products used in alternative medicine include 2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA), 2,3-Dimercaptopropane-1-Sulfonate (DMPS), and ethylenediamene tetraacetic acid (EDTA).\nAntimicrobial effects\nEDTA can disorganize the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, inhibit the coaggregation between pairs of microorganisms, and is possibly an effective inhibitor of bacterial adhesins (5764). Also, disodium EDTA inhibits the growth of Candida albicans in vitro. EDTA binds the calcium that is required for growth of this fungal species (4621).\nCardiac glycoside protective effects\nDisodium EDTA antagonizes the ventricular inotropic and chronotropic effects of cardiac glycosides on the heart by decreasing the amount of extracellular calcium in the blood (5761, 5762). Some researchers think that decreased extracellular calcium can increase potassium re-entry into myocardial cells, which then counteracts the intracellular potassium depletion caused by cardiac glycosides (5762).\nCardiovascular effects\nChelation therapy using disodium EDTA has been proposed by many for the treatment of various cardiovascular conditions, including atherosclerosis (5738, 5739, 5743, 5751, 5768). Many biochemical mechanisms have been proposed to justify the use of disodium EDTA in the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease (5738, 5741, 5743). These include that EDTA chelation therapy can extract calcium out of atherosclerotic plaques and clear atherosclerotic arteries (5742, 5749) or that calcium removed by chelation is replaced by calcium from the bone, causing secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) which then promotes a transfer of calcium from hardened arterial tissue and plaque to bone (5749). Another potential mechanism of action is that EDTA reduces exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, which are possible risk factors for myocardial infarction and stroke (94985). Other theoretical mechanisms include that EDTA blocks production of free radicals involved in reactions causing atherosclerosis by reducing iron loads (5738), by binding toxic metals released when blood clots in occluded arteries (5749), or that disodium EDTA prevents damage and mutation of arterial cells caused by free radicals (5749).\n\nNone of these proposed mechanisms have been scientifically proven (5749, 5756), and controlled scientific clinical studies have been unable to confirm that EDTA can reverse peripheral arterial occlusive disease (5740, 5742) or atherosclerotic vascular disease (5746, 5750, 5752, 5753, 5754, 5769).\nHeavy metal- and radioactive isotope- reducing effects\nEDTA binds and chelates metal ions in the following decreasing order: chromium, iron (ferric ion), mercury, copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc, calcium, cobalt, iron (ferrous ion), manganese, calcium, and magnesium (5737). After intravenous administration, accessible metal ions are chelated forming stable soluble complexes, which are then excreted in the urine (505).\n\nCalcium disodium EDTA is the form of EDTA used primarily for lead poisoning (5730, 5731, 5732, 5733, 5734, 5735, 5736). The calcium in calcium disodium EDTA is displaced by metal ions such as lead to form a soluble complex that is then excreted in the urine (15). Unlike disodium EDTA, calcium disodium EDTA can be administered without causing substantial changes in serum or total body calcium concentrations (15). Radioactive isotopes such as uranium and plutonium can also be chelated to a limited extent by calcium disodium EDTA (15).\n\nChelation therapy with DMPS and DMSA is also used for acute and chronic heavy metal poisoning (108098, 108099, 108110, 108112). DMSA forms sulfhydryl linkages to the metal and the product is excreted in the urine (108110).\nNeurologic effects\nIn animal models of lead poisoning, DMSA improves cognitive outcomes. However, in animals without previous lead exposure, DMSA produced lasting and pervasive cognitive dysfunction (108101)."

The level of ascaridole in chenopodium oil differs and depends on the part of the plant, the season, and the geography (97900). Other constituents of chenopodium oil include p-cymene, alpha-terpinene, limonene, and an isomerization product of ascaridole, isoascaridole (31176, 97900). In some phenotypes of the plant, these other constituents are found in much higher levels than ascaridole in the oil (97900). Piperitone and piperitone oxide have been shown as major constituents of chenopodium oil in one analysis. However, differences in analytical methodologies have been shown to affect the metabolism of ascaridole, possibly resulting in these other constituents (97900). Chenopodium essential oil extract contains alpha-terpinene, ascaridole, p-cymene, and carvacrol (112187).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, chenopodium oil has shown antibacterial effects against Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and weak antibacterial effects against some cariogenic bacteria (97900, 112187).\nAntifungal effects\nChenopodium oil has shown antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and other fungal species in vitro.

There is some concern that ALA might increase triglyceride levels more than other omega-3 fatty acids (12918); however, clinical research with a specific variety of chia called Salba shows that it does not significantly increase triglyceride levels (16124).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, chia might cause mild gastrointestinal adverse effects. Some patients consuming chia 40 grams daily for up to 6 months reported mild and transient gastrointestinal adverse effects such as flatulence and soft stools; however, the frequency of these adverse effects was similar to patients consuming an oat bran control (97940). Bloating and flatulence have been reported with a chia flour-based sports beverage (112385).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, chia might cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals. A single case of IgE-mediated anaphylactic reaction has been reported for a patient who consumed chia seeds. Symptoms, including pruritus in the mouth, urticaria, facial angioedema, shortness of breath, and dizziness, developed a few days after consuming chia seeds. The reaction was attributed to sensitivity to proteins in chia seeds (91517).\nless\nOncologic\nChia seeds contain a high concentration of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Epidemiologic research suggests that high dietary intake of ALA might increase risk for prostate cancer (1337, 2558, 7823, 7147, 12978). Other research suggests high intake or serum levels of ALA does not increase the overall risk of prostate cancer (12961, 15736); however, it might increase the risk of advanced prostate cancer (12961). Association with prostate cancer appears to depend on the sources of ALA. Dairy and meat sources have been positively associated with prostate cancer, whereas plant sources, such as chia seed, don't seem to affect prostate cancer risk (12909). According to a clinical trial, intake of ALA does not appear to increase levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) (91402).\nless",

A meta-analysis of small clinical studies suggests that consuming chia seeds, flour, powder, or oil for 7-24 weeks does not improve lipid levels in patients with conditions associated with hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of 10 small clinical trials in patients with various metabolic conditions, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and obesity, shows that consuming chia seeds, flour, or powder 15-60 grams daily for 7-24 weeks, or taking chia oil 6 grams daily for 8 weeks, does not reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with control groups consuming wheat bran, oat bran, dietary fiber, poppy seeds, or soybean oil (106657). While the patient populations in the studies analyzed are more likely to develop hyperlipidemia, it is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia.\nless\nObesity. Small clinical studies suggest that consuming chia seeds for up to 12 weeks does not reduce body weight in overweight or obese adults.\nOne small clinical study in overweight or obese individuals shows that ingesting chia seeds 25 grams mixed in 0.25 liters of water twice daily before meals for 12 weeks does not improve body composition or reduce blood pressure when compared with placebo (25533).

It is unclear if oral chia is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nA small clinical study in trained athletes shows that drinking a beverage containing 50% of calories from chia seeds (Greens Plus Omega 3 Chia seeds) and 50% of calories from a carbohydrate-containing beverage (Gatorade) for 2 days prior to participating in an endurance exercise lasting more than 90 minutes leads to similar performance when compared with Gatorade alone (25531).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Although there has been interest in using oral chia for CVD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chia for this purpose.\nDiabetes. Small clinical studies suggest that consuming chia for 4-6 months might reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with type 2 diabetes, although it does not appear to improve glycemic control or lipid levels and has shown mixed effects on body weight and inflammatory markers.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that consuming bread containing a specific, selectively bred type of chia (Salba, Salba Smart Natural Products LLC), providing 37 grams of chia daily for 12 weeks reduces SBP, C-reactive protein, and vonWillebrand factor, but not lipid levels, when compared with consuming bread containing wheat bran. This form of chia also significantly reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared to baseline, but not when compared with a wheat bran control (16124). Another small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity shows that consuming Salba chia 40 grams daily, either baked into bread or as a powder, in conjunction with a restricted calorie diet for 6 months reduces weight by 1.6 kg and waist circumference by 2.8 cm when compared with an oat bran control. However, consuming chia had no effect on body fat percentage, HbA1c, or fasting glucose levels (97940). Also, a small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that consuming chia seeds 40 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces SBP, but does not improve body weight, HbA1c, or levels of fasting glucose, lipids, or C-reactive protein, when compared with those not consuming chia (106658).\nless\nHypertension.

In patients already taking antihypertensive drugs, chia seems to have an even greater impact on SBP and DBP.

No improvements in blood pressure were reported in patients consuming a wheat bran control (91516).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome.

However, following the reduced calorie diet and drinking this beverage appears to lower serum triglycerides and C-reactive protein and improve glucose tolerance when compared with a reduced calorie diet alone (25534). It is unclear if these findings are due to chia, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral chia is beneficial for increasing muscle strength and muscle mass during resistance training.\nA very small clinical trial in healthy, non-resistance trained males shows that drinking a supplemental beverage containing chia flour 50 grams, providing 20 grams of protein and 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids, is no more effective than whey protein 20 grams or placebo for augmenting the increases in muscle strength and fat-free mass that occur with an 8-week whole body resistance training program (112385).

Chia seed supplementation may also modestly reduce visceral fat, body mass index, and waist circumference in patients with prediabetes when compared to baseline, but does not seem to improve lipid levels (104530, 110438). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group in both studies.\nless\nPruritus.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of chia are the seed and the sprout. Chia seed contains a high concentration of the omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid. It also contains a significant concentration of dietary fiber, protein, calcium, magnesium, iron, and antioxidants (16124). Salba is a selectively bred, white-colored variety of chia. This form of chia is believed to provide the most concentrated whole-food source of dietary fiber and alpha-linolenic acid. The Salba form of chia provides approximately 19% alpha-linolenic acid (16124).\nAnticancer effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that chia oil may reduce tumor growth and metastasis by increasing apoptosis (41581).\nCardiovascular effects\nDue to the fatty acid and dietary fiber content of chia, there is interest in using it as a food source for reducing cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and inflammation (91516). Animal research suggests that including chia seeds in a sucrose-rich diet can prevent the onset of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in previously healthy rats and can normalize dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in dyslipidemic rats (25536). Preliminary clinical research shows that consuming bread containing a specific variety of chia called Salba (Salba Nutritional Solutions) might reduce some cardiovascular risk factors such as systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein, von Willebrand factor; however, it does not seem to affect lipid levels (16124). Other preliminary clinical research in healthy adults suggests that consuming whole or ground Salba chia seed can attenuate an increase in blood glucose levels after a meal when compared with eating control bread or another glucose control (25535, 97939). However, in patients with type 2 diabetes, consuming bread containing Salba chia seed significantly reduces glycated hemoglobin when compared to baseline, but not when compared to wheat bran (16124). In patients with high blood pressure, chia seeds appear to modestly lower blood pressure (91516).\nDermatologic effects\nBecause chia seeds contain fatty acids, which appear to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential, there is some interest in using chia seeds topically to relieve pruritus. When applied topically, lotion containing chia seed oil 4% appears to improve pruritus by reducing skin dryness (25537).\nExercise performance effects\nBecause of its relatively high fatty acid content and moderate amount of carbohydrates, there is some belief that chia seeds may increase fat oxidation and reduce muscle glycogen usage during endurance exercises, which might improve overall energy usage during exercise (25531).\nHepatic effects\nDue to the fatty acid and dietary fiber content of chia, there is interest in using it to improve liver health. A study in rats fed a high-fat, high-fructose (HFHF) diet suggests that replacing some dietary fat with chia flour or chia oil decreases blood glucose and triglyceride levels and may improve liver steatosis when compared with rats maintained on an HFHF diet. Chia flour and chia oil also appeared to attenuate weight gain related to the HFHF diet. However, chia flour or chia oil did not affect liver enzymes, uric acid, or inflammatory proteins in the liver (110437).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nAmino acid availability combined with stimulus from resistance training increases muscle protein synthesis and consequently muscle mass and strength over time (112385). Because chia flour contains all essential amino acids and has good digestibility, it is of interest in sport nutrition for providing plant-based supplemental protein. Additionally, the omega-3 fatty acid content of chia is theorized to be beneficial for muscle function and muscle tissue phospholipid composition."

In a 17-year-old female, chickpea was the cause of a food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Symptoms started within 10 minutes into running, which occurred 10 minutes after consuming hummus containing chickpeas (115086). In another case, an 8-year-old female experienced severe wheezing and urticaria after consuming a dish containing chickpeas. As an infant, she had experienced urticaria after topical application of chickpeas. Later, she experienced severe wheezing upon inhalation of chickpea flour or its vapors (115095).

These studies have evaluated healthy adults, adults with an increased risk of CVD, and overweight or obese older females (115096, 115099, 115102, 115107). In 3 studies, chickpeas were supplemented in doses of at least 728 grams weekly or 140 grams daily, in conjunction with using 30% chickpea flour in bread and biscuits (115099, 115102, 115107). In another study, 82 grams of chickpeas were consumed daily for 4 weeks in combination with Phaseolus vulgaris and barley (115096). The validity of these studies is limited by their small size and heterogenous dosing regimens, and it is unclear whether any changes occurred due to the addition of chickpeas or the removal of other foods.

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with chickpea.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAlthough chickpeas and other legumes are rich in amino acids, the digestibility of amino acids from chickpea is thought to be lower than for most other protein sources. Some studies suggest that about 65% to 70% of amino acids in legumes are absorbed, although these studies used flours and protein isolates, from which proteins may be more readily available than whole chickpeas. However, one study evaluating a proprietary chickpea flour containing whole plant cells (PulseON, Pulseon Foods Ltd) shows that replacing 30% or 60% of white wheat bread flour with this chickpea flour increased serum levels of essential amino acids when compared with white wheat bread flour alone (115108). In one study of children 6-11 years of age, the amino acid digestibility of an extruded chickpea protein was 89% (115121).\nExcretion\nFollowing chickpea consumption, various constituents, including trigonelline, protocatechuic acid glucoside, hypaphorine, 3-methylhistidine, and dimethylglycine, are excreted in urine. Several amino acids, including lysine, are also excreted (115100, 115117).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of chickpea is the seed or bean. Chickpea is rich in protein, fiber, and unsaturated fat. It is also a source of succinic acid, malic acid, and complex sugars, such as raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose (115087, 115100, 115101, 115106, 115112, 115121).\nAppetite effect\nChickpea, like other legumes, is of interest for weight control. In humans, consuming chickpea powder modestly increases postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, hormones involved in satiety (115116). However, although some research disagrees, most research in healthy adults does not show that chickpea consumption improves satiety, appetite, or food intake (115097, 115110, 115114, 115115, 115116, 115118, 115122).\nCardioprotective effects\nChickpea, like other legumes, is of interest for cardiovascular benefits. In one small, exploratory study of healthy adults consuming buttered pasta, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation was modestly higher following a meal of pasta made with 60% semolina flour and 40% sprouted chickpea flour when compared with pasta made with 100% semolina flour (115109).\nGastrointestinal effects\nChickpea is a source of fiber and other polysaccharides. One small, exploratory study in healthy adults shows that consumption of chickpea for 3 weeks has negligible effects on intestinal microbial composition or fecal short chain fatty acid concentrations when compared with a control diet (115111).\nGlucose control effects\nThere is interest in adding chickpea to the diet to attenuate increases in postprandial glucose levels. In healthy adults, most research shows that postprandial glucose levels and insulin resistance are modestly reduced at specific time-points following the consumption of a meal containing chickpea when compared with a meal containing wheat, corn, rice, or potato. Any effect on insulin levels or the total area-under-the-curve for glucose is unclear; the evidence is mixed (115097, 115105, 115106, 115110, 115114, 115115, 115116, 115118, 115119, 115122)(115123).\n\nThe total glycemic load of a meal may impact the glycemic response in some studies. One small study shows that glucose levels after a chickpea-based meal are no different than after a meal containing a small potato; however, postprandial glucose levels are modestly lower after a chickpea meal when compared to a large potato meal (115113). In other small studies, postprandial glucose levels were measured after a second meal comprised of pizza. A first meal containing chickpea reduced postprandial glucose levels after the second meal when compared with a first meal comprised of macaroni and cheese. When compared with other legumes, postprandial glucose levels were not affected (115105, 115110, 115118). The long-term effect of a chickpea-based diet on glycemic control has rarely been investigated. One small study shows that consuming a diet containing canned chickpea and chickpea flour daily for 5-6 weeks does not affect fasting or postprandial measures of glucose, insulin, or insulin sensitivity when compared with a wheat-based or white bread-based diet (115106, 115107)."

Azelaic acid and 2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido-(3,4-b)indole-3-carboxylic acid have also been isolated from chicory root (41608). In total, over 100 chemical compounds have been identified from the plant (93650).\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal research suggests that constituents of chicory have analgesic activity (93650).\nAnthelmintic activity\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that chicory constituents have anthelmintic activity (93650).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nChicory extracts seem to have anti-inflammatory activity (11, 93647, 93650). In vitro research suggests that chicory inhibits prostaglandin E(2), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and key inflammatory cytokines (41611, 93647).\nAnti-obesity effects\nChicory is of interest for obesity. In animal research, chicory root increases levels of the satiety hormones cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide-1 and changes the composition of the intestinal microbiota (116502).\nAntiallergic effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that chicory has antiallergic effects, inhibiting mast cell-mediated immediate-type allergic reactions (41592, 93650).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal and in vitro research suggests that chicory extracts have antidiabetic effects (93650, 108543). Animal research suggests that dietary inulin-type fructans extracted from chicory root may modulate the production of peptides, such as incretins, by endocrine cells present in the intestinal mucosa. This effect may play a role in the management of obesity and diabetes through their capacity to promote secretion of endogenous gastrointestinal peptides involved in appetite regulation (41613). In a rat model of diabetes, chicory extract increases glucose-induced insulin secretion and protects against damage to pancreatic beta-cells (108543).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research shows that chicory extracts seem to have antibacterial and antifungal effects (93650). The sesquiterpene alkaloid constituents of chicory show evidence of bacteriostatic properties (11). Some in vitro research suggests that the bitter compounds in chicory, including lactucin, lactucopicrin, and the guaianolide sesquiterpenes, have antimalarial properties (93650).\nAntineoplastic effects\nAnimal and in vitro research suggests that chicory extracts inhibit tumor growth (93650).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that chicory extracts have antioxidant properties (93650, 108543).\nCardiovascular effects\nChicory is believed to slow the heart rate (2, 11), perhaps due to the presence of a digitalis-like compound (5).\nDermatologic effects\nChicory gel is of interest for the prevention of radiation dermatitis. Chicory mucilage is thought to form a barrier over the skin to improve skin hydration. Also, chicory constituents have antioxidant properties (115912).\nGastrointestinal effects\nHuman and animal research suggest that chicory has prebiotic effects, altering fecal microbial populations (41612, 115911), and possibly stimulating certain immunological responses (41612). Chicory and oligofructose and inulin, selective fermentable chicory fructans, have been shown to stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria, which are regarded as beneficial strains in the colon (41601, 41593, 41623, 115911).\n\nAdditionally, chicory root has been reported to have a mild laxative effect and to stimulate bile production (2, 6, 11, 41625, 115911). Some animal research also suggests that chicory root extract might prevent the development of ulcers (93650).\nHepatoprotective effects\nHuman and laboratory research suggest that chicory extracts have hepatoprotective properties, possibly by reducing inflammation (93650, 108542, 115909)."

Flavonoids include vitexin, quercetin, and rutin (106346).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests three triterpene compounds isolated from the Chinese cucumber seed might have anti-inflammatory effects (4042). A 50% ethanolic seed extract might have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects (4043).\nAntidiabetic effects\nChinese cucumber is frequently use in Taiwanese patients with type 2 diabetes. A water extract of the Chinese cucumber root might have hypoglycemic activity in individuals with normal blood glucose. Subsequent fractionation of the extract yielded five compounds. The activity of one of these suggests it might be useful in reducing blood sugars in individuals with diabetes (4045). Furthermore, animal research shows that ingesting an extract of Chinese cucumber has dose-dependent hypoglycemic effects in diabetic mice. A protein in Chinese cucumber seems to activate the kinase activity of the insulin receptor and increase glucose clearance (100754). There is also interest in Chinese cucumber for preventing diabetic nephropathy. In animal models, lectin from Chinese cucumber seems to prevent streptozocin-induced inflammation and damage to rat kidney tissues. Also, in vitro research suggests that Chinese cucumber lectin prevents diabetic nephropathy by suppressing nuclear factor-KB and caspase-9, which are activated by hyperglycemia and proteinuria (100755).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn animal research, Chinese cucumber seed oil improved antioxidant status and reduced lipid peroxidation (106346).\nAntitumor effects\nChinese cucumber fruit is used with other herbs for the treatment of cancer in traditional Chinese medicine. In vitro research shows that Chinese cucumber fruit results in apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (100756, 100757). Animal research shows that giving Chinese cucumber fruit granules to mice with NSCLC results in reduced growth, migration, and invasion of the cancer and increased survival time in the mice (100756).\nAntiulcerative effects\nSome evidence suggests a 50% ethanolic extract of the Chinese cucumber fruit might have protective effects against ulcers (4044).\nAntiviral effects\nChinese cucumber root contains several constituents that have in vitro activity against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The constituents trichosanthin and protein \"TAP 29\" can block HIV replication and some evidence suggests they might selectively kill HIV infected cells (6).\nReproductive effects\nTrichosanthin and momorcharin, constituents of the Chinese cucumber root, have demonstrated abortifacient effects. Trichosanthin injected intramuscularly or extra-amniotically can induce first-trimester abortions. It has also been used to terminate ectopic pregnancies (6, 100758). A sponge containing Chinese cucumber juice might induce abortions when inserted intravaginally (6). Trichosanthin and momorcharin might cause birth defects (12)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Chinese mallow are the leaf, stem, and seed. Chinese mallow seeds contain mucilage, flavonoids, and polysaccharides of L-arabinose, D-galactose, and D-glucose. These polysaccharides are known as MVS-1, MVS-IIA, and MVS-IIG. Chinese mallow also contains a peptidoglycan called MVS-V (14138, 14139, 14140, 14141, 14142). Other compounds found in Chinese mallow extracts include flavan-3-ols (epigallocatechin and catechin), flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin derivatives, biochanin A), fatty acids derived from octadecadienoic acid, quinic acid, tryptophan, and linolenic acid (110004).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro studies indicate that certain Chinese mallow constituents, including tetracontanyl palmitate and a ketone derived from the leaf, have activity against Escherichia coli (110004).\nAntioxidant effects\nAntioxidant phenolics are present in the highest quantities in the leaves of Chinese mallow but are also found in the seeds and stems. Extracts of the leaves have the highest activity in the ABTS free radical assay and the highest ferric reducing activity. The seeds have the highest ability to scavenge free radicals in the DPPH assay (110004).\nHypoglycemic effects\nLaboratory research suggests Chinese mallow might have hypoglycemic activity (14143, 102360). An in vitro study shows that a Chinese mallow seed extract increases phosphorylation and activation of 5-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in muscle cells, increasing glucose uptake into the cells. Feeding the extract to diabetic mice increases AMPK activity in muscles and liver, and reduces fasting and non-fasting blood glucose levels. Constituents of Chinese mallow extracts that have hypoglycemic activity include beta-sitosterol, polysaccharides, and peptidoglycans (102360, 110004).\nImmune system effects\nLaboratory research suggests that extracts of Chinese mallow might have anticomplement activity and affect immune system function (14138, 14139, 14141).

The mechanism may involve inhibition of alpha-glucosidase or enhanced glucose stimulated insulin release from islets (41634, 95003).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro, a methanol extract of the whole chirata plant showed inhibitory activity against Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, and Cladosporium oxysporum (95003).\nAntileishmanial effects\nLaboratory and animal research suggests that extracts derived from chirata were found to exhibit antileishmanial activity (41663, 95003). An extract of chirata inhibited the catalytic activity of topoisomerase I of Leishmania donovani. It is possible that the constituents amarogentin, amaroswerin, and sweroside are responsible for these effects (41649). Amarogentin was determined to be a potent inhibitor of type I DNA topoisomerase from Leishmania and exerts its effect by preventing binary complex formation. The amarogentin in both liposomal and niosomal forms was found to be a more active leishmanicidal agent than the free amarogentin (41629).\nAntimalarial effects\nLaboratory research shows that extracts of the leaves and stem of chirata possess activity against Plasmodium falciparum (95003). This may be due to the constituents swerchirin and gentianine (95003).\nAntineoplastic effects\nChirata has been reported to possess anticancer properties against various types of malignant and benign tumors (41633, 41664). An extract of chirata containing amarogentin exhibited antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in a mouse skin carcinogenesis model (41638). Activation of enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were suggested as being involved (41635, 41637, 41668). Swertiamarin, mangiferin, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid may possess anti-cancer effects (95003). Other in vitro research in colorectal cancer cells shows that chirata leaf extract treated with zinc oxide nanoparticles induced more cancer cell apoptosis when compared with control (112188).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant activity of chirata has been attributed to its flavonoid and secoiridoid constituents (31016). Laboratory research suggests that a mixture of Andrographis paniculata and Swertia chirata extracts prevented the formation of lipid peroxidation products (41667). The oxidative damage observed with depletion of major endogenous antioxidants, such as glutathione (GSH), was effectively reduced by chirata extracts. The degradation of mitochondrial proteins by reactive oxygen species, which is induced during photosensitization, was also prevented. The antioxidative property of chirata extracts were attributed to their scavenging ability with superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygen species. The high scavenging ability of the extracts may be due to high phenolic contents and flavonoid constituents. In animals, the amarogentin-rich extract caused a significant reduction in lipid peroxidation and inhibition of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase (41635, 41637, 41668).\nAntiviral effects\nLaboratory research shows that chirata extracts possess properties against Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (41643). Infected cell cultures treated with the extract failed to show amplification at 12 or 24-72 hours in a similar manner to that of acyclovir. Laboratory research shows that certain compounds from chirata ethanol extracts inhibit hepatitis B surface antigen secretion (95003). Mangiferin, a constituent of chirata may possess anti-HIV effects (95003).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nIn vivo, two chirata constituents (swertiamarin and mangiferin) appear to antagonize each other. Research in albino mice and rats shows that swertiamarin reverses the CNS-stimulating effects of mangiferin (41651).\nCYP Enzyme effects\nLaboratory research shows that an ethanolic extract of chirata leaves does not inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) or CYP3A4 (95002).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using chirata for the treatment of gastric ulcers. In animal research, an ethanolic extract of chirata reduced the intensity of gastric mucosal damage induced by indomethacin and necrotizing agents (41648). It decreased gastric secretion in pylorus-ligated rats and inhibited acetylcholine-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum, suggesting anticholinergic activity. Pretreatment of rats with the extract prevented ethanol-induced gastric wall mucus depletion. In laboratory research, chirata extracts inhibited the activity of pancreatic lipase (41632, 41665).\nHepatoprotective effects\nLaboratory research shows that chirata extracts exhibit hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and acetaminophen (41633). Components of chirata that are reported to be hepatoprotective include the ethylacetate extracts of twigs and the lignan syringaresinol (41658, 41666). Animal research suggests that methanol and chloroform extracts of chirata have hepatoprotective properties against paracetamol, galactosamine, and CCl4 (41627, 41628). In animals, simultaneous treatments with intraperitoneal chirata and CCl4 protected against CCl4 increases in liver enzymes and necrosis (41650).\nUrinary effects\nLaboratory research shows that chirata extracts inhibit the accumulation of urinary stone-forming minerals, such as calcium phosphate, oxalate, or carbonate (41659)."

    "Chitosan": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Chitosan is a polysaccharide deacetylated derivative of chitin, the structural component of the exoskeleton of arthropods, including insects, spiders, and crustaceans. Chitin is also found in some types of fungi, molluscs, and squid. In addition to its therapeutic applications, chitosan has been used in water treatment, as a drug carrier and excipient, and as a component in tissue engineering and wound healing materials (92782, 97711, 97713).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally, short-term. Chitosan has been used with apparent safety in clinical studies at a dose of up to 1.35 grams daily for up to 3 months (1942, 9609, 9610, 10022, 10023, 10024, 10025, 11307, 13171, 14314)(15126, 92781, 97708). ...when used topically, short-term (1944, 1945, 4269, 4270, 97712, 106521).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and topically, chitosan seems to be well tolerated, short-term.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, epigastric discomfort, and nausea.\nDermatologic\nIn one clinical trial, a subject with kidney failure reported itching during 12 weeks of oral chitosan treatment (1942). It is not clear if this was related to the underlying renal failure or the use of oral chitosan.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, chitosan has been reported to cause epigastric discomfort, constipation, flatulence, diarrhea, nausea, and dryness of the throat (1942, 3243, 9986, 11307, 14314, 41688, 92781, 100170). Excessive discharge of fat in the feces, also known as steatorrhea, has been reported with chitosan therapy (41724, 41726). Theoretically, chitosan may alter the normal intestinal flora via antimicrobial activity, which could interfere with lipid digestibility and bile acid metabolism, leading to the growth of resistant pathogens (41687, 41709, 41725).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, chitosan has been reported to cause swollen heels and wrists in two patients (41688).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nHeadaches have been reported in patients taking oral chitosan (41688).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nTopically, an eye drop containing chitosan-N-acetylcysteine has been reported to cause itching and irritation of the eyes (97710).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nHypertension. Substituting table salt with a chitosan-containing table salt may reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension.\nSmall clinical studies in patients with prehypertension or moderate hypertension show that taking a specific product (Symbiosal) containing chitosan 3% in table salt for 8 weeks decreases systolic blood pressure compared with table salt alone when used as part of a diet containing a maximum of 3 grams sodium chloride daily (97708, 97715). In adults with hypertension, this product increased the number of patients with controlled blood pressure by an additional 39% when compared with table salt alone (97715). In adults with prehypertension, this product increased the number of patients with systolic blood pressure less than 130 mmHg by an additional 67% when compared with table salt alone (97708).\nless\nObesity. Oral chitosan may lead to slight improvements in body weight when combined with a calorie-restricted diet in patients who are overweight or obese; however, it is unclear if this weight loss is clinically significant.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research in overweight or obese patients show that taking chitosan 1-3 grams daily for up to one year may slightly-to-modestly reduce body weight when compared with placebo; however, the average weight loss in trials lasting up to one year is only 1 kg more than placebo according to the most recent meta-analysis (41729, 92781, 100170). These analyses also show that taking chitosan can slightly improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels, in obese or overweight patients (92781, 100170). Chitosan may only be beneficial for weight loss when combined with a calorie-restricted diet. Some of the small clinical studies included in the analyses above show that combining chitosan with a calorie-restricted diet can result in modest weight loss (9610, 10022, 10023, 10024, 10025), while taking chitosan without calorie reduction does not seem to cause clinically significant weight loss (3243, 3244, 9986, 14314, 41724). It also does not seem to significantly increase fecal fat excretion, which is the suggested mechanism of action for reducing weight (9987, 10020, 11045, 14314).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Application of chitosan gel dressings after endoscopic sinus surgery may improve recovery by lowering the risk of nasal adhesions.\nA meta-analysis of three small clinical studies shows that use of chitosan gel dressing following endoscopic sinus surgery reduces the risk of nasal adhesions by 75% when compared with saline or no dressing. The chitosan dressings did not influence swelling, crusting, or infections (97713, 97714).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCrohn disease. Oral chitosan has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small, uncontrolled clinical study in adults with Crohn disease shows that taking a combination of chitosan 1.05 grams and ascorbic acid daily for 8 weeks increases fecal excretion of fat, but does not improve disease activity, when compared to baseline (9609). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nDental caries. While small studies suggest that use of chitosan-containing gum or mouthwash can decrease levels of cavity-causing bacteria, it is unclear if these products reduce the risk of developing dental caries.\nOne small clinical study in healthy adults shows that chewing gum supplemented with chitosan decreases the number of cariogenic bacteria in the mouth when compared with non-supplemented gum (15126). Additionally, a small crossover trial shows that rinsing with chitosan 0.5% mouthwash twice daily for 14 days can also decrease the number of cariogenic bacteria in the mouth when compared with placebo (41697). However, there is no reliable evidence that chitosan gum or mouthwash reduces the risk of developing cavities.\nless\nDental plaque. Small clinical studies suggest that rinsing with chitosan mouthwash may reduce plaque formation.\nOne small crossover trial shows that rinsing with chitosan 0.5% mouthwash twice daily for 14 days significantly reduces plaque formation when compared with placebo (41697). Another small clinical study in patients with dental plaque and gingivitis shows that rinsing with 10 mL of chitosan 0.5% mouthwash twice daily for 3 months reduces plaque formation when compared to baseline, with similar improvements when compared with chlorhexidine 0.2% mouthwash. However, rinsing with a combination of chitosan and chlorhexidine significantly improves plaque formation when compared with either agent alone (106521).\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if topical chitosan is beneficial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.\nA small clinical study in adults with diabetic foot ulcers shows that applying a thin smear of chitosan 10% gel to the ulcer is no more effective than placebo gel for ulcer healing. Also, when chitosan 10% gel is used in combination with topical isosorbide dinitrate two sprays daily, it is no more effective than the isosorbide dinitrate spray alone (100171). It is not clear if this study was adequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if chitosan-containing eye drops are beneficial in patients with dry eye.\nA small clinical study in patients with dry eye shows that applying a specific eye drop (Lacrimera) containing chitosan-N-acetylcysteine 0.1% once or twice daily to the eyes for 5 days improves general symptoms of dry eye by approximately 60% when compared to baseline (97710). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of placebo control group.\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if rinsing with chitosan mouthwash is beneficial in patients with gingivitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with gingivitis and dental plaque shows that rinsing with 10 mL of chitosan 0.5% mouthwash twice daily for 3 months reduces gingivitis scores when compared to baseline, with similar improvements when compared with chlorhexidine 0.2% mouthwash. However, rinsing with a combination of chitosan and chlorhexidine significantly improves gingivitis scores when compared with either agent alone (106521).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Despite conflicting study results in patients with hypercholesterolemia, a meta-analysis of small clinical studies suggests that oral chitosan may slightly improve lipid levels when taken for at least 4 weeks in overweight or obese patients with or without hypercholesterolemia.\nA meta-analysis of seven small clinical studies of obese or overweight patients with or without hypercholesterolemia shows that taking chitosan 1-4.5 grams daily for 4 weeks or longer can reduce both total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 6 mg/dL, increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by around 1 mg/dL, and reduce triglyceride levels by around 11 mg/dL when compared with placebo (92781). However, individual studies in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia show conflicting results. Some small clinical studies show that taking chitosan 1-3 grams daily for 1-3 months does not decrease total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol (3243, 9986, 11044), while other studies show that taking chitosan 1.2-1.35 grams daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces total cholesterol by 4% to 10% and LDL cholesterol by about 7% when compared with placebo (11307, 41693).\n\nSeveral clinical studies also suggest that chitosan-containing combination products seem to reduce cholesterol levels in obese patients or those with hypercholesterolemia. Combinations studied include chitosan 1.2 grams with glucomannan 1.2 grams daily for 1 month (11046); a fiber supplement containing chitosan, guar meal, ascorbic acid, and other micronutrients (10025); chitosan 240 mg, garcinia 55 mg, and chromium 19 mg once or twice daily for 4 weeks (41720); and a specific product (Tegradoc) containing chitosan 10 mg, berberine 200 mg, red yeast extract providing monacolin K 3 mg, and coenzyme Q10 10 mg daily for 12 weeks (97709). It is unclear if the positive findings associated with these combination products are due to chitosan, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHyperphosphatemia. It is unclear if chewing chitosan-loaded gum is beneficial in patients with hyperphosphatemia who are undergoing hemodialysis.\nOne very small clinical study in patients undergoing hemodialysis with hyperphosphatemia inadequately controlled with sevelamer shows that chewing 20 mg of chitosan-loaded gum twice daily for 2 weeks reduces serum phosphorous levels by 31% when compared to baseline (92784). The validity of this finding is limited by a lack of control group. Conversely, a slightly larger, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients on hemodialysis with phosphorous levels inadequately controlled on phosphate binders shows that chewing 40 mg of chitosan-loaded gum for 30 minutes three times daily for 3 weeks does not significantly reduce serum phosphorous levels when compared with placebo (92779).\nless\nIron deficiency anemia. Although there has been interest in using oral chitosan for iron deficiency anemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chitosan for this purpose.\nKidney failure. It is unclear if oral chitosan is beneficial in patients with kidney failure who are receiving hemodialysis.\nOne small clinical study in patients with kidney failure receiving chronic hemodialysis shows that taking chitosan 450 mg three times daily for 12 weeks reduces elevated cholesterol levels, improves anemia, and enhances physical strength, appetite, and sleep when compared with no treatment (1942).\nless\nMinor bleeding. Small clinical studies suggest that application of chitosan gel dressings after endoscopic sinus surgery may reduce the risk of minor post-surgical bleeding, while application of chitosan-containing gauze to skin grafts does not appear to reduce bleeding risk.\nA meta-analysis of two small clinical studies shows that use of chitosan gel dressing following endoscopic sinus surgery increases hemostasis by 70% when compared with saline or no dressing (97714). Over 60% of patients using chitosan gel achieved hemostasis within 2 minutes compared with 17.5% of patients not using chitosan gel (97713). However, one small study in patients with skin grafts shows that using chitosan gauze (AnsCare ChitoClot Gauze, BenQ Materials Corporation) with paraffin dressing for 2 weeks does not reduce the amount of blood loss when compared with paraffin dressing alone (97711). These conflicting results might be related to the form of chitosan used or the type of surgical wound to which it is applied.\nless\nMuscle strength. Although there has been interest in using oral chitosan for increasing muscle strength, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chitosan for this purpose.\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if topical chitosan is beneficial in patients undergoing surgery for periodontitis.\nA very small clinical study in patients with periodontitis undergoing dental surgery shows that applying chitosan ascorbate to the gums improves tooth mobility and pocket depths when compared to baseline (1945). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nWound healing. Several small clinical studies suggest that application of chitosan-containing dressings to skin grafts improves wound healing, scar formation, and nerve regeneration.\nOne small clinical study shows that applying a chitosan mesh dressing increases healing and regeneration of the skin in the first ten days after skin graft placement and reduces itching by about 50% when compared with paraffin dressing (97707). Another small clinical study in patients receiving skin grafts after surgery, burn wounds, or skin malignancy excision shows that application of a chitosan-containing dressing to the skin graft improves wound re-epithelialization and nerve regeneration, but does not improve the rate of healing, when compared with a conventional dressing (41692). Another small clinical study in patients undergoing plastic surgery shows that applying N-carboxybutyl chitosan topically seems to promote donor site tissue regeneration and reduce scar formation when compared with control donor sites (1944).\n\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing extraction of an impacted mandibular third molar shows that applying a topical gel (Bexident Post, ISDIN) containing chitosan, allantoin, dexpanthenol, and chlorhexidine as 10 mL three times daily for ten days increases the rate of good wound healing by an additional 52% and 36% after 7 and 14 days, respectively, when compared with no gel. However, this chitosan-containing gel does not appear to reduce postoperative pain or swelling (97712). It is unclear if these findings are due to chitosan, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate chitosan for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nChitosan is most often used in doses of 1-1.35 grams daily for up to 12 weeks. Higher doses of 2.4-3 grams daily are less common but have been used for up to one year. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nTopical:\nChitosan has been used in various topical formulations, including as a mouthwash, gel, chewing gum, eye drop, and wound dressing. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nChitosan preparation involves the deacetylation of chitin found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans. However, the preparation process is not standardized. The amount of chitosan in a product is highly dependent on a variety of factors such as quality of raw materials, manufacturing process, and packaging (92782).\n\nOne product, Symbiosal, combines chitosan with table salt through a patented process involving hydrolysis (97715).",

Concomitant administration of chitosan 400 mg or 1000 mg reduced the acyclovir area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration by about 30% and 40%, respectively, compared with control. Concomitant administration with chitosan 1000 mg also increased time to peak concentration from 1 hour to 2 hours (92780). In vitro research suggests that the mechanism for reduced absorption is due to acyclovir entrapment in chitosan-mucus complexes, which reduces intestinal absorption (112352).\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, chitosan might increase the risk of bleeding when taken with warfarin.\nIn a case report, a patient taking warfarin had a significantly increased international normalized ratio (INR) after starting chitosan 1200 mg daily. The INR normalized after chitosan was discontinued and vitamin K was administered. The patient once again started taking chitosan and again had a significant increase in INR. The INR stabilized again once chitosan was discontinued (15909). Researchers theorize that this interaction might occur because chitosan decreases absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K, which could increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.\nless",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSimilar to cellulose, chitosan undergoes minimal digestion (11043). Gastrointestinal enzymes partially digest chitosan, leading to some absorption. Taking chitosan 1 gram daily increases serum levels of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (92783).\nExcretion\nChitosan is excreted in the feces (11043).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nChitosan is the N-deacetylated form of chitin that is extracted from the shells of crustaceans such as shrimp, lobster, and crab (9987). It is a natural polysaccharide of 1,4-linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues (9987, 10021, 41725, 92782).\nAntibacterial effects\nAnimal and in vitro research suggest that chitosan has antibacterial effects (15126, 41712, 41715, 92782). While chitosan appears to have a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, lower-molecular-weight chitosan tends to have more activity against Gram negative bacteria and less activity against Gram positive bacteria than higher-molecular-weight forms. The exact mechanisms for these effects are unclear. Some research suggests that low-molecular-weight chitosan is able to penetrate bacterial cell walls, attach to DNA, and block DNA transcription and mRNA synthesis. High-molecular-weight chitosan, on the other hand, might bind bacterial cell wall components with a negative charge, altering cell wall permeability and limiting transport into the cell. Chitosan and chitosan-derivatives have demonstrated antibacterial effects against the following bacteria in laboratory research: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Corynebacterium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis (92782).\nAntifungal effects\nSome in vitro and botanical research suggests that chitosan exhibits antifungal activity against fungi known to infect certain plants. These fungi include Alternaria solani, Botrytis cineria, Fusarium oxysporum, Macrophomina phaseolina, Penicillium species, and Phytophthora infestans. Chitosan is thought to form a permeable film on certain plants, protecting them from fungal growth. Other laboratory research shows that chitosan and chitosan-derivatives have antifungal effects against Aspergillus species, Candida species, Cryptococcus species, Fusarium proliferatum, Hamigera avellanea, and Rhizopus stolonifera (92782).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that chitosan and chitosan-derivatives act as free radical scavengers. Unstable free radicals might react with amino and hydroxyl groups of chitosan, leading to stable radicals (92782).\nAntitumor effects\nSome in vitro and animal research suggests that chitosan and chitosan-derivatives have antitumor effects. While the exact mechanism remains unclear, some research shows that chitosan and chitosan-derivatives exert multiple effects including inhibiting MMP-9 expression; upregulating p21 and Bax; downregulating PCNA, cyclin A, CDK-2, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL; decreasing the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9; increasing the activity of Bcl-2; and increasing production of interleukin 1, interleukin 2, and lymphokines (92782).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is scientific interest in using chitosan to enhance absorption of drugs, such as peptides, which are typically unable to cross the intestinal mucosa. In laboratory research, synthetic derivatives of chitosan appear to increase permeation and intestinal absorption of hydrophilic macromolecules when added to drug formulations, such as low molecular weight heparin (10021).Theoretically, chitosan may alter the normal intestinal flora via antimicrobial activity, which could interfere with lipid digestibility and bile acid metabolism, leading to the growth of resistant pathogens (41687, 41709, 41725).\nGlycemic effects\nIn human research, taking chitosan before meals improves insulin sensitivity by approximately 50% (97706). The clinical significance of this effect is unclear.\nHematologic effects\nThere is some interest in using chitosan to minimize bleeding. However, research in a liver laceration model found that chitosan was less effective than thrombin for controlling bleeding. Chitosan also induced an increased inflammatory response by the healing liver when compared with thrombin treatment (41699).\nHypotensive effects\nChitosan is a cationic or positively charged polysaccharide. When combined with chloride, an anion, a complex is formed, limiting absorption. When chitosan is combined with sodium chloride as table salt, reduced chloride absorption results in a reduction in the activation of the renin angiotensin system (97708).\nLipid-lowering effects\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the alleged lipid-lowering effect of chitosan. Chitosan has been shown to alter bile acid composition (41726). An \"entrapping\" effect by chitosan on lipids and other nutrients has also been proposed (41707). Some evidence suggests that positively charged chitosan polymers bind to negatively charged bile acids and therefore lower cholesterol levels (10743). It is theorized that the lower molecular weight chitosan polymers such as HEP-30 might be more effective for lowering cholesterol due to a possible increased adherence to fats in the gut. It also remains to be determined whether the alleged weight loss effect of chitosan is also attributable to an interference with absorption and/or excretion of nutrients. However, no deficits in micronutrients were seen in obese subjects after four weeks of treatment with chitosan (3243).\nPeriodontal effects\nSome clinical research suggests that chitosan ascorbate acts as a surgical cement in treatment of periodontitis, protecting periodontal pockets from oxygen and allowing for proliferation of periodontal tissues (1945).\nRenal effects\nThere are two possible reasons for the reduction of nitrogen metabolite levels (serum urea and creatinine) in chronic renal failure patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. It has been proposed that chitosan activates the remaining renal function for the clearance of nitrogen metabolites, thereby resulting in the depletion of urea and creatinine levels in the body (1942). The second proposal is that the chitosan combines with nitrogen metabolites in the digestive tract and is then excreted, thus reducing serum levels of nitrogen metabolites.\nWeight loss effects\nChitosan is promoted as a fat blocker, similar to orlistat (Xenical, Alli). It is thought to work by binding to negatively charged dietary fat and bile acids in the intestine, decreasing their absorption. One study in adults with Crohn disease found that chitosan increases fecal excretion of fat (9609). However, studies in overweight adults suggest that chitosan does not significantly increase fat excretion (9987, 10020, 11045).\nWound healing effects\nWhile the exact nature of the interaction between chitosan and skin wounds is not clearly understood, a gel-like fibronectin matrix has been shown to form at the chitosan-wound interface, which may act either as a scaffold for inward epithelial migration or facilitate the formation of heparin-chitosan complexes (41719, 41692). Reported hemostatic and wound-healing activity might also be due to an enhancement of macrophages, fibroblasts, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes; this appears to be independent of the classical coagulation cascade (1943, 9608)."

Chlorella extract has been used in doses of 200-1800 mg daily for 4-6 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nMost chlorella sold in the United States is cultivated in Japan or Taiwan (3900). Processing of the chlorella cultures includes destroying the cell walls, dehydration, and sterilization (5851). Commercially available products include tablets and liquid extracts. The latter contains \"chlorella growth factor\", which is described as a water soluble extract of chlorella containing amino acids, peptides, proteins, vitamins, sugars, and nucleic acids (5890). Since chlorella is a naturally occurring organism, its content can vary with growing, harvesting, and processing conditions.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of chlorella.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nChlorella contains chlorophyll, carotenoids, protein, lipids such as omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, carbohydrates, fiber, nucleic acids, vitamins including B12, B6, methyl cobalamine, folate, and vitamin K, iron, trace elements such as zinc, copper, and magnesium, and minerals (5890, 41808, 41812, 41821, 41830, 92131, 92132, 92133, 95013). It also contains sporopollein and numerous antioxidants, such as beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, alpha- tocopherol, zeaxanthin, and others (92132).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in using chlorella for its anticancer effects. Laboratory research has shown that chlorella has antiproliferative effects towards HepG2 cells (41814). Animal research shows that chlorella has antitumor activity that may be due to effects on toll-like receptor 2 signaling (41810).\nAntidepressant effects\nThere is interest in using chlorella for its antidepressant effects. Oxidative stress is thought to play a role in certain mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) (92132). There is some evidence that levels of antioxidants in the brain and plasma are lower in patients with MDD. Additionally, depression may alter the activity of antioxidant enzymes. These alterations lead to the inability to protect against oxidative stress, which can lead to damage of cellular components. Chlorella is rich in antioxidants and various trace elements that are necessary for antioxidant enzyme functioning and may improve the antioxidant imbalance seen in depression. MDD also leads to impaired neurogenesis and neurodegeneration. Chlorella contains sporopollein, which can bind neurotoxins. It also contains alpha and gamma linoleic acid which may be neuroprotective, and methyl cobalamine, an absorbable form of B12, which may improve depressive symptoms. Lastly, mitochondrial malfunctioning may also ply ay a role in the pathogenesis of depression. Chlorella may boost energy production and the biogenesis of mitochondria, leading to improved physical functioning (92132).\nAntioxidant activity\nLaboratory research shows that chlorella has antioxidant properties. (41814). Carotenoids, a component of chlorella, appear to have free radical scavenging activity (92131).\nAntiviral effects\nThere is interest in using chlorella for its antiviral effects as it may be stimulate the immune system. In animals, chlorella may increase cell mediated immunity, and in humans, it has increased natural killer cell activity as well as the production of cytokines (92130). However, chlorella doesn't seem to affect antibody response to influenza vaccine in humans (10388).\nAthletic performance effects\nThere is interest in using chlorella for improving athletic performance. In young healthy adults, chlorella reduces blood lactate levels and enhances oxygen delivery to tissues during a 20 minute cycling bout, but does not improve maximal oxygen uptake (116141).\nCardiovascular effects\nClinical research shows chlorella reduces pregnancy-associated leg edema and protein in the urine. Laboratory research shows the mechanism behind this may be related to chlorella's ability to decrease inducible nitric oxide synthetase and nitric oxide production. This may protect against endothelial dysfunction induced by oxidative stress. Additionally, chlorella may alter inflammatory regulatory cytokines, which may further prevent inflammatory associated endothelial cell dysfunction. However, in clinical research, these effects do not seem to translate into clinically meaningful decreases in blood pressure in pregnant females (95013).\nDetoxification effects\nThere is interest in using chlorella for its detoxifying effects. Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are food-related carcinogens. HCAs and PAHs are formed from meat cooked at high temperatures. Functional foods are thought to detoxify the body from the HCAs and PAHs. Chlorella is thought to be a functional food. It contains chlorophyll which may trap HCAs or PAHs (92133). Chlorophyllin is a semi-synthetic form of chlorophyll, and may form complexes with HCAs as well. Both chlorophyll and chlorophyllin may prevent absorption of dietary carcinogens in the gut (92133). Finally, chlorella may also be able to chelate and detoxify chemicals (92133).\n\nDue to its portability and photosynthetic efficiency, scientists have also been interested in using chlorella in bioregenerative life support systems for spacecraft and other closed biological systems for decades (41804, 41805, 41809, 41822, 41823, 41829, 41831).\nImmunological effects\nThere is interest in using chlorella for its immunologic effects. Laboratory research shows that chlorella has immunomodulatory activities (10388) An extract of chlorella cells, ONC-107 (Respondin), stimulated B cell proliferation and activated macrophages (41820). A chlorella powder showed inhibition activity of enzymes, receptor binding, cellular cytokine release, and B and T cell proliferation (41813). Chlorella has also increased mRNA levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (41807). Chlorella might stimulate the immune system by increasing the number and activity of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It might also stimulate interleukin production (10388). A polysaccharide from the cell wall of chlorella might also induce production of interferon (6804).\nLipid effects\nThere is interest in using chlorella for its effects on lipids. A clinical study in patients with hypertension noted that cholesterol levels decreased after administration of chlorella (41802). In another clinical trial, chlorella decreased concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), non-high density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB). VLDL, if not metabolized properly, can convert into LDL cholesterol. ApoB leads to secretion of LDL particles and is a marker of cardiovascular disease risk. Chlorella may inhibit the absorption of dietary lipids. Chlorella contains omega-3 fatty acids, which inhibit the assembly of VLDL in the liver. The fiber contained in chlorella also plays a role in triglyceride absorption. Chlorella supplementation also lead to increases in carotenoids. This promotes a decrease in lipid levels since the carotenoids compete with the lipids for incorporation and transport into lipoproteins. Additionally, carotenoids may also inhibit the absorption of triglycerides. Overall, the improvement or increase in serum carotenoids was thought to cause the decreases in lipids. Changes in serum TG and TC appeared to be correlated with changes in carotenoid concentration (92131). However, chlorella didn't affect HDL levels, nor levels of apoE or apoA1, suggesting it has no role in reverse cholesterol transport (92131)\nNutrition effects\nThere is some evidence that consuming chlorella can increase serum vitamin B12 levels (5848). However, it has been suggested that the vitamin B12 found in chlorella might be in an inactive form which can raise serum levels without contributing biological activity (5849)."

This improvement was reported after 1 day and 1 week (115957). Additionally, multiple small clinical studies, some included in the meta-analysis above, show that rinsing with a specific chlorine dioxide 0.1% mouthwash (RetarDEX or UltraDEX, Periproducts Ltd.) for 30 seconds reduces exhalation of volatile sulfur compounds, which are associated with halitosis, and improves subjective measures of odor pleasantness and odor intensity when compared with a water control or baseline. This improvement was notable after 2 hours and continued for up to 8 hours post-rinse (102813, 102814, 102816, 108749).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nChlorine dioxide is a greenish yellow, unstable gas that does not occur naturally in the environment. It is a strong oxidizing agent which causes tissue damage on contact (108748). When exposed to sunlight, it breaks down to chlorine gas and oxygen. It is highly soluble in water, forming chlorite (108748). Chlorine dioxide is commonly used in public water treatment plants as a disinfectant (102811). Some supplement products containing sodium chlorite are sold with the intention of creating chlorine dioxide by mixing the product with citric acid (102810).\nAntimicrobial effects\nChlorine dioxide is a potent disinfectant and has demonstrated superior activity against bacteria, viruses, yeast, and mycobacteria when compared with bleach, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, chlorhexidine, and quaternary ammonium compounds (102819). Clinical research shows that chlorine dioxide, used orally as a rinse or gel, reduces the number of oral bacteria (115955, 115956).\nDermatologic effects\nTopical application of dilute chlorine dioxide has demonstrated keratolytic activity. Chlorine dioxide reacts directly with cysteine, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine, proline, and histidine, breaking down keratin chains and acting as a highly specific keratolytic. Case reports suggest that topical application of chlorine dioxide may be beneficial in patients with keratosis pilaris (102819).\nHematologic effects\nIn animal toxicology studies, chlorine dioxide has caused anemia and hemolysis, possibly due to modification of erythrocyte morphology and function. Additionally, chlorite, a byproduct of chlorine dioxide, can oxidize hemoglobin, producing methemoglobin. This may result in methemoglobinemia at high levels of exposure (102805).\nOdor reduction effects\nOral malodor, or halitosis, is caused by high concentrations of volatile sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide, in the oral cavity. These high levels are likely due to the build-up of bacteria in the grooves, fissures, and interpapillary areas of the tongue. In human studies, chlorine dioxide has reduced oral malodor and the concentrations of volatile sulfur compounds, likely via antimicrobial activity (102812, 102813, 102814, 102816)."

In vitro, chlorophyllin has demonstrated antimutagenic activity in human lymphocytes (1312). This effect may be due to reduced carcinogen DNA-binding (1309), reduced chromosome damage (1311), and reduced carcinogen-induced cell transformation (1307).\n\nThere is also interest in using chlorophyllin to reduce the absorption of dietary carcinogens. A series of clinical studies in China have found that taking chlorophyllin 100 mg three times daily for 3 months reduces the absorption and bioavailability of aflatoxin, a fungal toxin that increases the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (101236, 41847, 41839). Additionally, one small clinical study in healthy volunteers found that consuming cruciferous vegetables, yogurt, and chlorophyllin reduced the mutagenicity of fried meat in colon cells (41887). However, animal research shows that feeding a diet containing chlorophyllin 0.3% to mice who are also consuming benzo[a]pyrene, a carcinogen, increases the occurrence of some tumors and decreases the occurrence of other tumors. This suggests that any chemoprotective effect of chlorophyllin might be inconsistent (101233).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in using chlorophyllin for various inflammatory conditions. In vitro, chlorophyllin has demonstrated activity against Propionibacterium acnes-induced inflammation in skin cells by attenuating the production of interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (101243). In a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease, adding chlorophyllin to the diet reduced intestinal inflammation and symptoms of colitis, likely by decreasing levels of inflammatory cytokines (110664).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn animal research, chlorophyllin has demonstrated antioxidant activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Specifically, chlorophyllin supplementation reduced levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl. It was also associated with an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, including copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and catalase (101209).\nHepatic effects\nThere is interest in using chlorophyllin to improve liver health. A mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) suggests that adding chlorophyllin to a high-fat diet may attenuate liver steatosis, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and weight gain when compared with mice who did not receive chlorophyllin (110663).\nOdor reduction effects\nThere is interest in using chlorophyllin to reduce various bodily odors, including breath odor, fecal odor, and urinary odor. Most of this interest seems to originate from two anecdotal reports. One case series, which discussed the use of chlorophyllin for wound healing, mentioned that chlorophyllin also resulted in a reduction in unpleasant odors (101503). Another report, which evaluated the use of chlorophyllin in geriatric nursing home patients, found that taking chlorophyllin tablets might be beneficial for reducing body and fecal odors and improving constipation and flatulence (1321). However, there is no proposed mechanism of action for these effects. Additionally, clinical research in adults with indwelling catheters shows that chlorophyllin does not reduce urinary odor (1323).\n\nIt is possible that chlorophyllin might be beneficial for the management of specific types of odors. A case series in adults with trimethylaminuria, or fish-like odor syndrome, suggests that taking chlorophyllin might reduce the presence of the odorous metabolite, trimethylamine, and increase the presence of the odor-free metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide (45922). However, it is unlikely that the mechanism of this effect would translate to the management of other bodily odors. For example, clinical research shows that consuming chlorophyllin 100 mg along with garlic is not effective for reducing the presence of garlic volatiles in the breath when compared to consuming garlic alone (101242)."

    "Chokeberry": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Chokeberry is the fruit of the aronia shrub. It is commonly consumed in Eastern Europe and Russia (92362). Chokeberry is used to produce fruit syrup, fruit juice, tea, spreads, jellies, and alcoholic drinks, such as spirits and wines. Black chokeberry is the type most commonly used for fruit production (92361, 92377). Chokeberry has been traditionally used for the common cold (92360, 92367).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, short term. Capsules and juices containing chokeberry have been used with apparent safety in clinical studies lasting up to 90 days (92363, 92364, 92366, 92368, 92369, 92371, 92372, 92374, 92375, 98086)(111115, 111116).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using in medicinal amounts.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, chokeberry seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps, vomiting.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, chokeberry juice may cause adverse gastrointestinal effects. In one small clinical study, around 14% of patients reported constipation, diarrhea, or gastrointestinal motility issues while drinking 100 mL of chokeberry juice daily for 90 days (92375). In another small clinical study, around 53% of patients reported diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea, stomachache, stomach cramps, or vomiting while drinking 100 mL of chokeberry juice twice daily for 6 weeks (111119).\nless",

Oral chokeberry does not appear to improve body composition, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, or glycemic control in individuals with or at risk for CVD.\nMost clinical research, including a meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials, shows that taking chokeberry does not reduce body mass index, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, or glucose levels in patients with a history of or risk factors for CVD (92374, 102900, 103183). The meta-analysis does, however, show that chokeberry can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by around 1.5 mg/dL when compared with placebo. However, this improvement is unlikely to be clinically significant (103183).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral chokeberry is beneficial for preventing or treating age-related cognitive decline.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults aged 40-60 years who are at risk for cognitive decline due to age and obesity shows that taking a specific chokeberry extract (Brainberry, Bioactor BV) 90 mg daily for 24 weeks improves psychomotor speed when compared with placebo. However, taking 150 mg daily has no effect. Also, neither dose improves attention, cognitive flexibility, mood, brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, or vascular parameters such as carotid artery blood flow (105540).\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although there has been interest in using oral chokeberry for AMD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chokeberry for this purpose.\nAthletic performance. Limited-quality research on the use of oral chokeberry for improving athletic performance is mixed.\nA small clinical study in semi-professional soccer players in Poland shows that taking lyophilized black chokeberry extract 6 grams daily for 90 days improves performance on a 20-meter shuttle run test when compared with placebo (111116). However, another small clinical trial in a similar study population shows that drinking chokeberry juice 200 mL daily for 7 weeks does not improve performance on the 20-meter shuttle run test when compared with placebo (111115). The disparate findings may be due to differences in the chokeberry formulations and study durations.\nless\nBurning mouth syndrome. It is unclear if topical chokeberry is beneficial in patients with burning mouth syndrome.\nA small clinical study in menopausal patients with burning mouth syndrome shows that rinsing with 15 mL of chokeberry juice for 5 minutes three times daily for 4 weeks reduces symptoms of burning mouth syndrome when compared to baseline (111117). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of placebo control group.\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral chokeberry for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chokeberry for this purpose.\nCellulite. Although there has been interest in using oral chokeberry for cellulite, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chokeberry for this purpose.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral chokeberry is beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nA small, open-label clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that drinking chokeberry juice 50 mL three times daily for 3 months does not improve fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol levels, blood pressure, or measures of kidney function when compared to baseline (111118).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral chokeberry is beneficial in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nA small clinical study in males with mild hypercholesterolemia shows that drinking chokeberry juice 250 mL daily might decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared to baseline. Chokeberry juice was consumed for 6 weeks, followed by a 6-week break, and then consumed for another 6 weeks. No reduction in LDL cholesterol levels was seen after the first 6 weeks; however, LDL cholesterol levels decreased by 17% from baseline after another 6 weeks of consumption (92369). Due to the conflicting outcomes and lack of control group, it is not clear if chokeberry lowers LDL cholesterol levels.\nless\nHypertension. Some limited-quality evidence suggests that oral chokeberry might lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension; however, conflicting results exist, and the available studies have all been short-term.\nOne small clinical study in patients with slightly high blood pressure or mild hypertension shows that drinking chokeberry juice 200 mL daily for 4 weeks improves systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both while awake and on average over a 24-hour period, when compared to baseline (92372). However, this study is limited by a lack of control group. Another small clinical study in patients with mild hypertension shows that drinking chokeberry juice 300 mL mixed with chokeberry powder 3 grams daily for 8 weeks reduces daytime diastolic blood pressure by 1.6 mm Hg when compared with placebo; however, this effect is modest, at best, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and daytime systolic blood pressure were not improved (98086).\n\nChokeberry juice in combination with other berries has also been evaluated for hypertension. A small clinical study in patients with mild hypertension shows that drinking a specific juice (Mana Blue or Optijuice, Tine SA), containing juice from chokeberries, grapes, cherries, and bilberries, 500 mL daily for 12 weeks modestly improves systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, when compared with a placebo juice (92371). It is unclear if this effect is due to chokeberry, other components of the juice, or the combination.\nless\nKidney failure. It is unclear if oral chokeberry is beneficial in patients with kidney failure.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis-induced anemia shows that taking chokeberry extract 30 mL daily for 30 days improves some measures of anemia, including levels of hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, when compared to baseline (111120). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of placebo control group.\nless\nMale infertility. Although there has been interest in using oral chokeberry for male infertility, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chokeberry for this purpose.\nMetabolic syndrome. Some limited-quality clinical research suggests that oral chokeberry might improve blood pressure and lipid levels in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults with metabolic syndrome show that taking a specific extract of chokeberry (Aronox, Naturex) 300 mg daily for 2 months reduces systolic blood pressure by 8%, diastolic blood pressure by 6%, total cholesterol levels by 6%, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 8% to 9%, but does not affect blood glucose levels or body composition, when compared to baseline (92363, 92364). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of a control group. An open-label case series of patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a standardized chokeberry extract (Alixir 400 Protect, Pharmanova) 30 mL daily for 4 weeks decreases body weight when compared to baseline. It also decreases LDL cholesterol in females and total cholesterol in females with diabetes, increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in females without diabetes, and decreases triglycerides in both males and females with diabetes, when compared to baseline (105542). The validity of these results is limited by the study design, analysis of multiple subgroups, and the lack of a control group. Another small clinical study in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that drinking a citrus juice containing chokeberry extract 5% 300 mL daily for 6 months lowers total cholesterol levels by 8% when compared to baseline and by 12% when compared with placebo (92365). However, it is unclear if these findings are due to chokeberry, other ingredients in the juice, or the combination.\nless\nObesity. Oral chokeberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in females with overweight or obesity and at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease shows that drinking a combination of chokeberry, apple, blueberry, and cranberry juice 300 mL daily for 6 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), or blood pressure but might improve total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared to baseline (111121). Additionally, a small clinical study in postmenopausal patients with abdominal obesity shows that drinking 100 mL of chokeberry juice enriched with glucomannan fiber 2 grams daily as part of a regular diet for 4 weeks reduces BMI by 3%, waist circumference by 4%, and systolic blood pressure by 8% when compared to baseline (92368). The patients in this study were sedentary and following moderately unhealthy diets. It's unclear how chokeberry juice compares to dieting or exercising to improve these outcomes.\n\nOverall, the lack of control groups limits the validity of the findings above. It is also unclear whether the findings are due to chokeberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there has been interest in using oral chokeberry for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chokeberry for this purpose.\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral chokeberry is beneficial for the prevention of UTIs.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in elderly adults residing in nursing homes shows that drinking chokeberry juice an average of 89-156 mL daily for 3 months does not reduce UTI occurrence rate or the use of antibiotics when compared with placebo (92367).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate chokeberry for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nChokeberry juice has most often been consumed at a volume of 200-500 mL daily for up to 12 weeks. Research on chokeberry extract is limited, and typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nClinical trials have evaluated chokeberry juice (92367, 92369, 92372, 92373, 92375) and chokeberry extract (92363, 92364, 92366, 92374). Some studies use juices which contain chokeberry juice along with other ingredients (92365, 92371). One specific juice used in clinical trials is Mana Blue (Tine SA), which contains red grape juice 67.7%, chokeberry juice 14.5%, sour cherry juice 12%, and bilberry juice 5.8% (92371). Optijuice (Tine SA) contains Mana Blue juice 85% plus a blackcurrant press residue 15% (92371).\n\nA specific chokeberry extract used in many clinical trials is Aronox (Naturex). Each capsule of Aronox contains a total of 85 mg composed of anthocyanins 25%, monomeric and oligomeric procyanidins 50%, and phenolic acids 9% (92363, 92364, 92374, 92377). Another specific chokeberry extract used in clinical trials is Alixir 400 Protect (Pharmanova) which is standardized to contain polyphenols 431 mg and anthocyanins 120 mg per 30 mL (105542). Another specific chokeberry extract (Brainberry, BioActor BV) contains anthocyanins 18% (105540).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with chokeberry.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAnthocyanins from chokeberry juice are absorbed into the plasma, reaching maximum concentrations in 1-3 hours (92454, 92457). Anthocyanins may be absorbed intact as glycosides (92362).\nMetabolism\nCyanidin 3-galactoside is metabolized to peonidin 3-galactoside in the colon prior to absorption (92455). At least ten anthocyanin metabolites have been identified in human serum and urine following use of chokeberry extract. These metabolites consist primarily of glucuronide conjugates and methylated and oxidized derivatives of cyanidin 3-galactoside and cyanidin glucuronide (92456, 92457).\nExcretion\nAnthocyanins from chokeberry juice are excreted in the urine. Maximum urine concentrations occur within 2-4 hours of intake (92454, 92457).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of chokeberry is the berry and the juice derived from the berry. Chokeberry juice is high in anthocyanins and procyanidins, such as cyanidin 3-galactoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and cyanidin 3-arabinoside. It also contains small quantities of chlorogenic acid and quercetin. The constituent composition of chokeberry may depend on factors such as maturation, location, and harvest date (92361). Chokeberries are also high in fibers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (92361).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal research, chokeberry has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, possibly by decreasing the production and activity of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and prostaglandins (92450, 92451).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn laboratory research, chokeberry has demonstrated broad anti-microbial effects, with potent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (92428).\nAnticancer effects\nLaboratory and animal research show that chokeberry demonstrates anti-mutagenic effects, prevents cancer cell proliferation, and induces apoptosis. This may be due to constituent anthocyanins, such as cyanidin 3-glucoside (92361). The constituents of chokeberry may also play a role in preventing invasion of cancer cells by reducing the expression of enzymes that allow for invasion (92429).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that drinking chokeberry juice might improve glucose levels in patients with diabetes (92373). Possible mechanisms may include the inhibition of enzymes involved in carbohydrate and fat digestion (92430, 92432). Animal research suggests that chokeberries might modulate various pathways related to insulin resistance, including insulin signaling, adipogenesis, and inflammation (92431).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe anthocyanin constituents of chokeberry are known for their antioxidant activity in laboratory, animal, and human research (92361, 92368, 92369, 92372, 92375). Taking chokeberry extract appears to reduce levels of antioxidants and modify blood levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (92363, 92368, 92374, 92433, 92434, 92435, 92436, 92437, 92438, 111122). In competition-level handball players, taking a specific chokeberry extract (Pharmanova) 30 mL daily for 12 weeks reduces levels of pro-oxidant substances, including thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and nitrites, and increases levels of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and SOD (105541). In healthy, middle-aged adults, taking chokeberry extract 300 mg daily for 8 weeks increases reduced glutathione availability and glutathione peroxidase activity in response to exercise (111122).\nAntiviral effects\nThe effects of chokeberry on the influenza virus have been investigated in laboratory research. The constituents ellagic acid and myricetin may play a role in the antiviral effects of chokeberry (92439).\nCardioprotective effects\nThe potential cardioprotective effects of chokeberry might be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of chokeberry constituents. In laboratory research, chokeberry extract appears to protect endothelial cells lining the aorta from inflammation (92440). Preliminary clinical research suggests that chokeberry might temporarily inhibit the aggregation of platelets and reduce plasma lipids and blood pressure levels (92361, 92363, 92364, 92371, 92372). In clinical research. chokeberry has also been shown to improve membrane fluidity in red blood cells by reducing membrane cholesterol levels and improving antioxidant status (92442).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using chokeberry to reduce cellulite. Preliminary clinical research shows that drinking chokeberry juice daily for 90 days reduces subcutaneous tissue thickness by an average of 1.9 mm, which was associated with a subjective assessment of improved skin tightness by 69% of study participants. Subcutaneous edema was reduced from 55% at baseline to 0% after 90 days of chokeberry supplementation. However, no objective measures of cellulite improvement were provided, and chokeberry juice was not associated with a change in body fat percentage (92375).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn animal research, chokeberry has been shown to improve the colonic environment by enhancing intestinal barrier function and attenuating the disturbance of gut microbiota caused by a high fat diet. Chokeberry intake was also associated with an increase in colonic levels of fecal mucin and immunoglobulin A (92453).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn laboratory research, chokeberry appears to protect the liver against toxins, possibly due to its antioxidant constituents (92361).\nHypolipidemic effects\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that chokeberry reduces plasma lipid levels in patients with hyperlipidemia or metabolic syndrome (92363, 92364, 92369), while studies in healthy patients and those with general cardiovascular risk factors show conflicting results (92374, 102900, 103183). Animal research suggests that any benefit may be due to the antioxidant effects of chokeberry rather than effects on hepatic cholesterol metabolism (92441). Also, laboratory research shows that chokeberry might reduce the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed in the intestines (92243).\nHypotensive effects\nChokeberry has demonstrated hypotensive effects in clinical research (92371, 92372, 103182), although other studies show mixed results (102900, 103183). At least some research suggests that the hypotensive effects of chokeberry may be related to inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity (92374, 92444). Other research suggests that chokeberry juice might induce endothelium-dependent relaxation of the artery wall via increased nitric oxide production (92369, 92448, 92449).\nImmune effects\nChokeberry may have immune effects. In breast cancer patients, chokeberry improves T cell counts (92452). In animal research, intake of chokeberry improves intestinal barrier function and increases levels of immunoglobulin A, irrespective of systemic absorption (92453).\nNeuroprotective effects\nChokeberry has been associated with improved memory in animal research. This is likely related to the antioxidant effects of the berry and its constituents (92445, 92446). In the mouse hippocampus, chokeberry appears to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and the expression of certain compounds, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (92447)."

Other clinical research in untrained adults shows that taking oral choline 8.425 grams or 50 mg/kg once prior to participating in exhaustive, load-carrying exercise does not improve dexterity, upper or lower body strength, grip strength, or run time-to-exhaustion following exercise when compared with placebo (42229, 42237).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline.

Also, adolescents aged 11-16 years experienced no benefits, and some experienced an increase in behavioral symptoms, such as irritability (103571). It is unclear if this effect is due to choline, donepezil, or the combination.\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if dietary intake of choline reduces the risk of breast cancer.\nA meta-analysis of 6 low to moderate-quality observational studies suggests that neither high nor low dietary intake of choline is associated with breast cancer risk. This finding is largely influenced by inclusion of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) cohort study, which analyzed data from over 300,000 subjects. However, subanalysis of 3 case-control studies suggests that high dietary intake of choline may be associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer when compared with low choline intake (111416). The interpretation of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, self-reported data, and a small number of studies.\nless\nBronchitis. Although there has been interest in using oral and inhaled choline for bronchitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of choline for this purpose.\nCancer. It is unclear if dietary choline intake reduces the risk for cancer.\nA meta-analysis of 11 low-quality population studies has found that high dietary intake of choline is associated with an 18% lower risk of cancer when compared with low choline intake. High dietary intake of both choline and betaine was associated with a 40% lower risk of cancer (97390).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if dietary choline intake reduces the risk of CVD or improves outcomes in patients with CVD.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that high intake of dietary choline is not associated with a lower risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, or mortality when compared with a diet low in choline (97388). A more recent population study has found that energy-adjusted total choline intake is not associated with the incidence of CVD over ten years. However, the highest intake of free choline is associated with a 34% reduced risk of CVD when compared with the lowest intake (109104).\nless\nCerebellar ataxia. It is unclear if oral choline is beneficial in patients with cerebellar ataxia.\nDespite some anecdotal reports suggesting that taking choline improves motor function, preliminary clinical research shows that taking choline 4-5 grams orally daily for 4 days to 6 weeks does not reduce cerebellar ataxia (5161, 5173, 23679).\nless\nCirrhosis. Although there has been interest in using oral choline for cirrhosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of choline for this purpose.\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral choline is beneficial for improving cognitive function in healthy adults.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a single dose of choline 50 mg/kg orally prior to participating in an exhaustive, load-carrying task does not improve reaction time, reasoning, memory, or serial addition and subtraction ability following the task when compared with placebo (42237). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients requiring long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) shows that adding choline chloride 2 grams daily to TPN for 24 weeks might improve delayed visual memory, but does not improve other measures of cognitive performance, when compared with TPN alone (42232).\nless\nDementia. Although there has been interest in using oral choline for dementia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of choline for this purpose.\nDepression. It is unclear if oral choline is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of depression.\nObservational research has found that dietary choline intake of at least 198 mg daily is associated with a 32% to 43% decreased risk of depressive symptoms when compared with intakes of less than 198 mg daily (109106). It is unclear if choline supplementation is beneficial for depression.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral choline is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of type 2 diabetes; the available research is conflicting.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking oral choline bitartrate 1000 mg daily for 2 months does not affect coagulation parameters or levels of triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes (103569).\n\nCholine has also been evaluated for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. In Finnish males, observational research has found that dietary intake of total choline at levels of more than 482 mg daily, especially as phosphatidylcholine, is associated with a 25% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the following 19.3 years when compared with intakes of less than 382 mg daily (103567). However, in males and females in the US, additional observational research has found no association between dietary choline and risk of type 2 diabetes over a mean of 9 years (103570). In addition, a sub-analysis found that the highest intakes of choline (a median of 487 mg daily) were associated with a 54% higher risk of type 2 diabetes among females, but not males, when compared with the lowest intakes (a median of 175 mg daily) (103570).\n\nPopulation research in patients with diabetes has found that an intake of dietary choline in amounts of at least 279 mg daily is associated with a 2.1-fold increased odds of diabetic retinopathy in females, but not males, when compared with an intake less than 206 mg daily (109102). It is unclear if choline itself is responsible for the increased odds of diabetic retinopathy in this population.\nless\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). It is unclear if oral choline improves cognition in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD).\nClinical research in children aged 2.5-5 years with FASD shows that taking oral choline bitartrate, providing choline 500 mg, daily for 9 months does not improve global cognitive development or hippocampal-dependent memory when compared with placebo. However, a subgroup analysis of only children aged 2.5-4 years suggests that choline may improve hippocampal-dependent memory (92112). Follow-up of this study at 7 years shows that choline improves motor speed and suggests a trend towards improved color naming, which are components of executive functioning testing, when compared with placebo (111745). The validity of these findings is limited by the high rate of patient discontinuation which limits statistical power. A small clinical trial in children 5-10 years old with FASD shows that taking oral glycerophosphocholine, providing choline 625 mg, daily for 6 weeks does not improve cognitive function, executive function, attention, or hyperactivity when compared with placebo (97389).\nless\nHepatitis. Although there has been interest in using oral choline for hepatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of choline for this purpose.\nHuntington disease. Although there has been interest in using oral choline for Huntington disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of choline for this purpose.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral choline is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of hypertension.\nPopulation research has found that every 100-mg increase in daily dietary choline intake is associated with a 15% decreased risk of developing hypertension over the next 4.6 to 9.1 years (109098). However, it is unclear if any benefits are specifically related to dietary choline or whether choline supplementation is beneficial.\nless\nInfant development. It is unclear if oral choline intake during pregnancy is beneficial for infant development; the available research is conflicting.\nTwo observational studies have found that higher intake of choline during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy is associated with improvement in offspring cognitive development and visual memory at the age of 18 months and 7 years, respectively, when compared with lower choline intake (94654, 94657). One of these studies found that each 1 mcmol/L increase in maternal blood levels of choline at 16 weeks' gestation was associated with a 2.23-point increase in cognitive skill score based on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 18 months of age (94657). Also, some observational research has found that higher plasma levels of choline during pregnancy are associated with higher processing speed and decreased social withdrawal at 4 years of age in the offspring (109101). In contrast, 3 observational studies have found that higher intake of choline during pregnancy, as well as higher maternal and cord blood levels of choline, are not associated with improved offspring intelligence at 5 years of age or cognitive performance at 3 or 7 years of age (94654, 94655, 94656). However, many of these observational studies, including those with positive findings, included populations with a mean intake of choline that was below the recommended adequate intake of 450 mg daily (94654, 94656). It's possible that higher intake of choline is needed to observe a benefit; however, research on the effects of choline supplementation is limited. One small clinical trial shows that taking choline 930 mg daily during the third trimester modestly improves sustained attention in the child at 7 years of age when compared with taking 480 mg daily (109105).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral choline is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking oral choline 400 mg daily for 4 weeks does not decrease body weight, blood pressure, plasma glucose levels, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with baseline (105731).\nless\nNeural tube birth defects. It is unclear if oral choline intake is beneficial for preventing neural tube defects.\nPopulation research has found that females who have a high dietary choline intake around the time of conception have a lower risk of having offspring with a neural tube defect when compared to those with lower intake (13134).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral choline is beneficial in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\nA cross-sectional analysis of results from observational and clinical research shows that low dietary intake of choline is associated with increased fibrosis in postmenopausal adults with NAFLD, but not in children, males, or premenopausal adults with NAFLD. Dietary choline intake was not associated with steatosis severity in any patient subgroup (92109).\nless\nSchizophrenia. Although there has been interest in using oral choline for schizophrenia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of choline for this purpose.\nTourette syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral choline for Tourette syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of choline for this purpose.\nTPN-associated hepatic steatosis. It is unclear if intravenous choline is beneficial in patients with TPN-associated hepatic steatosis.\nIn patients receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN), plasma levels of choline can decrease. Small, low-quality clinical studies show that administering intravenous choline 1-4 grams daily for 24 weeks improves some markers of TPN-associated hepatic steatosis when compared with baseline or placebo (5174, 42235).\nless\nComplex partial seizures. Although there has been interest in using oral choline for complex partial seizures, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of choline for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate choline for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nThe recommended daily adequate intake (AI) of choline is 550 mg for males and 425 mg for females. The AI during pregnancy is 450 mg; the AI during lactation is 550 mg (3094).\n\nCholine has most often been used in doses of 1-3 grams daily, taken in 1-3 divided doses, for up to 4 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nIntravenous/Intramuscular:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nChildren\nOral:\nThe recommended daily adequate intake (AI) of choline is 125 mg for 0-6 months of age, 150 mg for 7-12 months of age, 200 mg for 1-3 years of age, 250 mg for 4-8 years of age, 375 mg for 9-13 years of age, 550 mg for males 14-18 years of age, and 400 mg for females 14-18 years of age (3094).\n\nResearch on the use of supplemental choline is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nTypically, intravenous choline is administered as choline chloride.

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with choline.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCholine displays one-compartment pharmacokinetics with very slow oral absorption (91231). In human research, consuming choline from egg yolk phospholipids resulted in plasma levels 4-times higher than those that occurred with choline bitartrate supplements (103568). However, other human research shows that there is no difference in plasma choline concentrations in the 24 hours after intake of choline from four different sources, including choline chloride, choline bitartrate, alpha-glycerophosphocholine, or egg phosphatidylcholine. Peak concentrations were delayed for egg phosphatidylcholine, occurring at about 3 hours (109103).\nDistribution\nCholine concentrates in nervous tissue as a component of cell membranes (272).\nMetabolism\nCholine that is not absorbed is metabolized by intestinal bacteria to trimethylamine (TMA) (42323, 42276, 42277, 42283, 92114). In human research, blood levels of the liver-derived metabolite TMA oxide (TMAO) increased only after intake of water-soluble choline supplements, including choline chloride, choline bitartrate, and alpha-glycerophosphocholine, but not egg phosphatidylcholine (109103). In human research, plasma levels of the choline metabolites betaine and dimethylglycine increased to a greater extent after intake of choline from egg yolk phospholipids than with choline bitartrate (103568). However, other human research shows that there is no difference in plasma betaine concentrations in the 24 hours after intake of choline from four different sources, including choline chloride, choline bitartrate, alpha-glycerophosphocholine, or egg phosphatidylcholine (109103). In human research, plasma levels of alpha-glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, dimethylglycine, methionine, carnitine, phosphatidylcholine (PC), lyso-PC, or sphingomyelin were not affected by intake of supplemental choline (109103).\nExcretion\nThe elimination half-life of oral choline has been reported to extend up to 56 hours (92108).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCholine has traditionally been considered a B vitamin. However, this is controversial because choline can be synthesized by the human body (5139). Choline is produced in the liver via the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine. S-adenosylmethionine is the methyl donor for this reaction (1949). Choline is also readily available in the diet, typically as phosphatidylcholine and lecithin. Foods that supply large amounts of choline are liver, muscle meats, fish, nuts, beans, peas, eggs, wheat germ, spinach, and others. A typical diet provides 200-600 mg daily (59281, 103567).\n\nCholine is required for the structure of cell membranes and for lipid metabolism and transport, as well as for the formation of compounds involved in neurotransmission and platelet function (103569, 109107).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCholine selectively activates alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system. These receptors are also found on immune cells, and activation leads to decreases in the production of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (91231). However, clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking oral choline 400 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces plasma interleukin-6 levels by approximately 20%, but does not reduce TNF-alpha levels, when compared with baseline. Consuming 3 whole eggs daily, which contains approximately 400 mg of choline, produced similar results (105731).\n\nCholine is also thought to reduce asthma-associated inflammation by lowering lysophosphatidylcholine levels (5165).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary clinical evidence shows that choline may decrease oxidative stress (42253).\nCardiovascular effects\nCholine is used in cell membrane phospholipids and as a methyl donor for the synthesis of many endogenous compounds. For example, choline can be oxidized to betaine which serves as a methyl donor to convert homocysteine to methionine, then S-adenosylmethionine (1949, 14846). Dietary intake of choline might also decrease homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (14846). The effect of dietary choline intake may be greatest on those with lower folate levels (14845).\nCognitive effects\nThere is evidence that choline supplementation can increase the density of alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7 nAChR). These receptors play a role in normal cognitive processes including attention, working memory, and executive function. It is thought that by activating alpha7 nAChR, choline can improve cognitive function (92108).\nErgogenic effects\nSome research shows that plasma choline levels are reduced following prolonged or high-intensity exercise (42296, 42319, 42320, 42321). There is some speculation that endurance exercise might increase demand for choline to optimize muscle performance. However, most clinical research suggests that choline does not improve athletic performance during endurance sports or exhaustive exercises (5164, 42229, 42237).\nHepatoprotective effects\nDeficiency of choline is uncommon except in people receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (5139, 5174). Choline deficiency, related to long-term TPN use, can result in increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and fatty liver (92110). Adding choline to the TPN solution usually improves liver function (1949, 3094). This indicates that dietary choline is required in addition to the choline normally synthesized by the body (5139, 5174). In animal models, long-term withdrawal of choline from the diet can cause hepatocarcinoma (5178, 5180).\n\nObservational research in adults diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma has found that high dietary choline intake is associated with a lower all-cause mortality when compared with low dietary intake. Subgroup analyses also suggest that the protective effects of dietary choline are relegated to water-soluble forms of choline, and that other forms, such as phosphatidylcholine and betaine, do not provide mortality benefits (105732).\nMemory enhancing effects\nSupplemental choline during pregnancy and lactation probably affects the birth, death, and migration of cells in the hippocampus during fetal brain development and possibly changes the distribution and morphology of neurons responsible for memory function in the brain (1949). When used during pregnancy, choline appears to increase cell proliferation and decrease cell apoptosis in the hippocampus of the fetus. When used during lactation, choline appears to improve hippocampal growth in the infant, possibly through the fourth year of life (92112). Choline also seems to play a role in preventing neural tube defects (13134).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nCholine concentrates in nervous tissue as a component of cell membranes (272). It is required for phospholipid synthesis and is involved in brain development, neurotransmission, and signaling (92109, 92110, 92111). Some researchers are interested in choline for Alzheimer disease because it is a precursor to acetylcholine. However, there is evidence that oral choline does not affect concentrations of choline metabolites such as acetylcholine in the brain. This might be the reason oral choline does not seem to be effective for neurodegenerative disorders of cholinergic transmission such as Alzheimer disease (5175).\n\nSome evidence suggests that patients with schizophrenia have decreased expression of alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7 nAChR) in the brain. Alpha7 nAChR play a role in normal cognitive processes including attention, working memory, and executive function. There is evidence that choline supplementation can increase the density of alpha7 nAChR. It is thought that by activating alpha7 nAChR, choline can improve cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia (92108). However, most clinical research shows that choline supplementation does not reduce symptoms of schizophrenia (5171, 5172). But there is some preliminary evidence suggesting that maternal intake of choline may decrease biomarkers for schizophrenia in the infant, suggesting that maternal supplementation with choline may help prevent schizophrenia in the infant (92114).\n\nThere is also interest in using choline to improve cognitive development in patients with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). In patients with FASD, it is believed that choline contributes to dendritic growth, improved memory, production of acetylcholine in neurons, and the creation of phospholipids, which are required for neuronal growth and myelination (92111). In one study, initiating choline supplementation by 23 weeks' gestation was found to attenuate the negative effects of high alcohol exposure on the volume of some sections of the developing infant brain. Some evidence suggests that this is related to greater processing speed in infancy (109099)."

Chondroitin supplements are typically obtained from natural sources, such as shark and bovine cartilage, or produced synthetically (1973, 42335).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Chondroitin sulfate has been used safely in doses of up to 2000 mg daily for up to 6 years (1955, 2533, 13579, 17732, 22212, 42339, 42343, 42348, 42389, 42396)(42398, 42463, 42477, 42513, 42520, 42536, 42541, 89516, 89558, 89592)(89596, 94360, 94381, 95788, 95792). However, since chondroitin is often derived from bovine cartilage, historically, there was concern about contamination with diseased animal parts (1825). So far, there are no reports of disease transmission to humans due to use of contaminated chondroitin preparations. ...when used topically and appropriately as an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD).

Intramuscular and ophthalmic use also seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There have been rare reports of hepatotoxicity.\nCardiovascular\nOne case of congestive heart failure and another case of myocardial infarction has been possibly attributed to use of glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate (13579, 42477). Also, a case of mesenteric occlusion in one patient was considered possibly related to treatment with chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine (89520).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, chondroitin sulfate has been associated with skin symptoms, such as eyelid edema, lower limb edema, alopecia, and skin rash (42513). Combinations of chondroitin sulfate along with glucosamine hydrochloride may also be associated with rash, water retention around eyes and scars, and hives on face, chest, torso, and legs when taken orally (42436, 110628). A case of photosensitization that was reproducible with rechallenge has been reported following treatment with oral glucosamine-chondroitin products. However, it is not clear if this effect was due to glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, or contaminants in the product (10408). A case of rash following treatment with intravesical chondroitin sulfate has been reported to be possibly related to the product (42385).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, chondroitin might cause nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, dyspepsia, and epigastric burning (42396, 42436, 42541, 89561, 110628, 111647).\nless\nGenitourinary\nIntravesical chondroitin sulfate has been associated with cases of vulvar burning, vaginitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), dysuria, pelvic pain, and other bladder symptoms, such as increased frequency, urgency, or incontinence. However, these effects might be due to catheterization rather than chondroitin sulfate (42385, 42387, 42473).\nless\nHematologic\nConcern has been expressed about possible anticoagulant activity of oral chondroitin sulfate. However, hematological changes have not occurred in patients taking chondroitin sulfate in clinical trials (760).\nless\nHepatic\nAlthough relatively uncommon, combinations of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have been associated with acute liver injury that mimics autoimmune hepatitis. Two cases of elevated aminotransferase levels have been reported for patients taking glucosamine (form unspecified) and chondroitin sulfate at recommended doses. Aminotransferase levels, which were increased by four- to seven-fold, returned to normal following discontinuation of treatment (89515). Another case of abdominal pain, jaundice, fatigue, and elevated liver enzymes has been reported for a patient who used chondroitin sulfate (Condrosulf) for 2 years followed by a combination of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (Vita Mobility Complex) for 8 weeks. The patient required maintenance treatment with azathioprine to remain in remission (89518). A case of acute cholestatic hepatitis due to Glucosamine Forte, which contains glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, Devil's claw, and shark cartilage, has been reported (89522). It is unclear whether these adverse events were related to chondroitin sulfate, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, chondroitin has been associated with musculoskeletal and connective-tissue events and disorders (13579, 42520, 95516).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nRare cases of headache have been reported following treatment with products containing a combination of oral chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride or glucosamine sulfate (42436, 89561).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCataracts. Chondroitin sulfate in combination with sodium hyaluronate is approved as a medical device to be ophthalmically injected during cataract surgery. It is unknown if other routes of administration are beneficial.\nInjecting ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs) containing a combination of chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate into the eye protects the corneal endothelium during small-incision cataract surgery. Various medical devices containing chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate (Viscoat, Alcon Laboratories) have been granted approval by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as an adjunct to cataract surgery (89436, 89437). However, OVDs that cannot be easily removed after surgery can cause intraocular pressure (IOP) spikes and reduced visual acuity. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies shows that using a specific chondroitin sulfate 4% and sodium hyaluronate 3% solution (Viscoat, Alcon Laboratories) after small-incision cataract surgery increases IOP at postoperative days 1 and 2, but not at any later postoperative days for up to 1 month (104452).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Chondroitin sulfate seems to modestly reduce osteoarthritis pain and improve function. Pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate products have shown the most benefit.\nMultiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in patients with mostly knee osteoarthritis show that taking chondroitin sulfate 600-2000 mg in single or divided doses daily for at least 3 months modestly improves pain, disability, and physical function when compared with placebo. However, included studies were heterogeneous and most had high attrition bias. A sub-group analysis of high-quality studies shows that 16 patients need to take chondroitin sulfate for 6 months for one patient to experience at least a 20% reduction in pain (94381, 95792, 99685, 104446, 113636). When compared with conventional treatments like diclofenac 50 mg three times daily, chondroitin sulfate improves symptoms more slowly; however, the improvement seems to persist for up to 3 months after treatment cessation (322). Chondroitin also seems to have disease-modifying benefits. Clinical research in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip shows that taking chondroitin sulfate 800 mg daily or more for 2 years might modestly reduce joint degeneration and narrowing when compared with placebo or celecoxib (42348, 42398, 94381, 95516).\n\nOverall, most of the positive research involved pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate products, which are available as prescription products in some countries, such as Chondrosulf (IBSA Institut Biochimique SA) (17732, 42348, 42398, 42536, 89596, 94360, 104446), Chondrosan (Bioibérica, S.A.) (42463, 42513), and Structum (Laboratoires Pierre Fabre) (22212, 42520, 89593). One clinical study shows that taking a pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin product (Chondrosulf) 800 mg daily seems to be comparable to taking celecoxib 200 mg daily for reducing pain and improving knee function (94360). Pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin products might demonstrate greater benefit due to higher quality (94360, 102116). It is also important to note that most clinical studies using pharmaceutical-grade products are manufacturer-funded (94381). Furthermore, they may not be readily available for purchase in the US.\n\nExperts have conflicting stances on the use of chondroitin for osteoarthritis. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) strongly recommends against the use of chondroitin for any form of osteoarthritis (102114). Conversely, the European Society of Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) strongly recommends for the use of pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin products. Additionally, the ESCEO provides a weak recommendation against the use of chondroitin in combination with glucosamine (102141). These differing recommendations seem to be related to interpretation of the evidence for pharmaceutical-grade products. The ACR has determined that the inconsistent evidence may indicate the presence of industry bias; the ESCEO has determined that the inconsistent evidence is due to inconsistent product quality.\n\nChondroitin is often used in combination with glucosamine and/or other products. Long-term studies in patients with osteoarthritis show that taking non-branded chondroitin sulfate with glucosamine sulfate modestly reduces joint-space narrowing when compared with control (89558, 94380, 95792). However, meta-analyses and individual clinical studies assessing non-branded preparations of chondroitin sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride or glucosamine sulfate do not show reduced pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis when compared with control (13579, 89558, 95788, 99683, 99685, 113636). However, the studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\n\nIn contrast, pain reduction was reported for branded formulations such as chondroitin sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride and manganese ascorbate (Cosamin DS, Nutramax Laboratories) (4237, 7169); chondroitin sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride (Droglican, Bioiberica, S.A.) (89516); or chondroitin sulfate with collagen peptides and hyaluronic acid (BioCell Collagen, BioCell Technology, LLC) (28678, 28680). A large, prospective observational study in adults with knee or hip osteoarthritis suggests that taking glucosamine hydrochloride 500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 400 mg (Theraflex, Bayer) three times daily for the first 3 weeks, then twice daily thereafter for up to 64 weeks, is associated with reductions in pain, stiffness, and the need for concomitant analgesic therapy, and improvements in daily function and knee- or hip-related quality of life, when compared to baseline. The most pronounced improvements are from 16-24 weeks (111647). It is unclear if the benefit seen with these specific products is due to bias introduced by industry funding or due to higher quality.\n\nLimited research has also evaluated INTRAMUSCULAR and TOPICAL chondroitin. Some clinical research shows that receiving daily intramuscular injections of chondroitin sulfate for 6 months improves pain and function in patients with osteoarthritis (42396, 42397). A topical preparation of chondroitin sulfate in combination with glucosamine sulfate, shark cartilage, and camphor also seems to reduce arthritis symptoms. However, any symptom relief is most likely due to the counterirritant effect of camphor and not the other ingredients (10327). There is no research showing that chondroitin is absorbed topically.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. Oral chondroitin sulfate has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in females with aging skin shows that taking a specific combination product (BioCell Collagen, BioCell Technology, LLC) containing chondroitin sulfate 200 mg, collagen peptides 600 mg, and hyaluronic acid 100 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces lines and wrinkles by about 13% when compared with baseline (28681). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. It is also unclear if these improvements are due to chondroitin sulfate, other ingredients, or the combination. Furthermore, it should be noted that this study was funded by the product manufacturer.\nless\nAromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. Oral chondroitin sulfate has only been evaluated in combination with glucosamine sulfate; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small open-label clinical study in postmenopausal females with early stage breast cancer shows that taking a combination of glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 1200 mg in 2-3 divided doses daily for 24 weeks improves pain and symptoms associated with aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgias when compared to baseline (89561). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nCancer. Some low-quality observational studies suggest that oral chondroitin use is not associated with a lower risk of cancer.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that use of chondroitin with or without glucosamine is not associated with a lower risk of cancer when compared with no use (110625).\nless\nColorectal adenoma. Oral chondroitin has only been evaluated in combination with glucosamine; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn observational study in older adults has found that taking oral chondroitin and glucosamine is associated with a 26% reduced chance of high-risk adenoma and 10% reduced chance of conventional adenoma when compared with not using these supplements. This benefit was not seen in a subgroup of younger females (104444).\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if ophthalmic chondroitin sulfate improves dry eye symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with dry eye suggests that administering an ophthalmic preparation of chondroitin sulfate every two hours while awake for 2 weeks seems to improve symptoms when compared to baseline (1974). Chondroitin has also been used in combination with other ingredients. A large clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate dry eye disease shows that applying preservative-free eye drops containing chondroitin sulfate with sodium hyaluronate (Humylub Ofteno PF, Laboratorios Sophia), one drop into each eye four times daily for 90 days, seems to be no different for improving dry eye severity when compared with using polyethylene/propylene glycol eye drops (Systane Ultra, Alcon Laboratories) (104443). Another small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate dry eye shows that using specific eye drops containing chondroitin sulfate and xanthan gum (PRO-148, Laboratorios Sophia) four times daily for 60 days does not improve tear stability, but might improve dry eye severity, when compared with using polyethylene/propylene glycol eye drops (Systane, Alcon Laboratories) (89591).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral chondroitin sulfate improves muscle soreness from exercise.\nPreliminary clinical research in untrained males shows that taking chondroitin sulfate 1800 mg twice daily for 14 days before exercise does not reduce post-exercise muscle soreness when compared with placebo (42352). However, another small clinical study in healthy, recreationally active adults shows that a specific combination product (BioCell Collagen, BioCell Technology, LLC) containing chondroitin sulfate 300 mg, collagen peptides 900 mg, and hyaluronic acid 150 mg, taken twice daily for 6 weeks prior to two bouts of resistance exercise, attenuates muscle damage and decreases delayed-onset muscle soreness when compared with placebo (96301). It is unclear if these effects are due to chondroitin sulfate, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nGastritis. Oral chondroitin sulfate has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with gastritis shows that taking a specific liquid product (Esoxx, Alfa Wasserman Spa) containing chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid four times daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces upper abdominal pain when compared with placebo (99687). It is not clear if this effect is due to chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, or the combination.\nless\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Oral chondroitin sulfate has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPatients with non-erosive GERD are thought to be less responsive to conventional acid suppression with proton pump inhibiters (PPIs) and H-2 blockers. A small preliminary clinical study shows that taking a syrup containing hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate along with PPIs, H2-receptor antagonists, and/or antacids, reduces the intensity of symptoms associated with non-erosive GERD by about 3.5-fold when compared with placebo (89592). A larger clinical study in patients with non-erosive GERD shows that taking the same combination agent (Esoxx by Alfa Wassermann) in addition to acid suppression with PPIs improves GERD symptom severity by 21%, heartburn by 15%, and regurgitation by 10% when compared with PPIs with a placebo (101271). This product is available in Canada as EsopH (Exzell Pharma). It is unclear if the benefit of this combination product is due to chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, or the combination.\n\nChondroitin sulfate has also been evaluated in patients with GERD who experience extraesophageal symptoms. A small clinical study in patients reporting symptoms of cough, hoarseness, postnasal drip, sore throat, and/or throat clearing shows that taking a specific combination product (Gerdoff, SOFAR S.p.A.) containing chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and aluminum hydroxide three times daily with omeprazole 40 mg once daily for 6 weeks does not reduce overall symptom scores, based on the Reflux Symptoms Index (RSI) score, when compared with omeprazole alone. However, it does increase the probability of treatment response, defined as a 50% or greater improvement in RSI score, by nearly 40% (109648). This product is available in Italy. It is unclear if these findings are due to chondroitin sulfate, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Although there is interest in using oral chondroitin for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chondroitin for this condition.\nInterstitial cystitis. Small clinical studies suggest that intravesical chondroitin sulfate may not improve interstitial cystitis symptoms. Oral chondroitin sulfate has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSeveral uncontrolled, open-label studies suggest that intravesical chondroitin sulfate, with or without hyaluronic acid, improves clinical symptoms of interstitial cystitis and reduces the problems caused by symptoms in these patients (42338, 42371, 42373, 42385, 42387). However, in controlled clinical trials, intravesical chondroitin sulfate 2%, instilled weekly for 6-7 weeks, does not significantly improve symptoms when compared with a placebo solution (42473, 42517). Furthermore, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intravesical chondroitin sulfate with hyaluronic acid does not improve pain due to interstitial cystitis better than using hyaluronic acid solution alone (97054).\n\nOral chondroitin has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific product (CystoProtek, Tischon Corporation) containing glucosamine sulfate 120 mg, sodium hyaluronate 10 mg, chondroitin sulfate 150 mg, quercetin 150 mg, and rutin 20 mg, as two capsules twice daily for 12 months, reduces symptoms of interstitial cystitis by 44% to 52% (42391). It is not clear if this effect is due to chondroitin, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nKashin-Beck disease. It is unclear if oral chondroitin sulfate improves Kashin-Beck disease symptoms such as pain.\nA small clinical study in Chinese adults with Kashin-Beck disease shows that taking chondroitin sulfate 600 mg twice daily with or without glucosamine hydrochloride 480 mg three times daily for 6 months decreases pain and stiffness when compared with placebo (42516).\nless\nKnee pain. Oral chondroitin sulfate has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate meniscal tears shows that taking a combination product containing chondroitin sulfate 750 mg, collagen peptides, glucosamine sulfate, hyaluronic acid, hydrolyzed collagen type II, methylsulfonylmethane, and other ingredients (Naturagen 4 Joint, Naturagen) daily for 8 weeks improves some assessments of pain and function but does not improve objective measures, including leg strength, balance, or stair climbing time, when compared with placebo (116134). It is unclear if these effects are due to collagen peptides, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOsteoporosis. Although there is interest in using oral chondroitin for osteoporosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chondroitin for this condition.\nOverall mortality. Oral chondroitin has only been evaluated in combination with glucosamine; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA cross-sectional observational study suggests that using oral chondroitin and glucosamine for at least one year is associated with a 27% lower incidence of overall mortality and 58% lower incidence of cardiovascular mortality when compared with not using these supplements (104445). However, this study did not clarify the forms of chondroitin and glucosamine used, or the doses, frequencies, or durations of use. Furthermore, the adults that reported glucosamine and chondroitin use also reported overall healthier lifestyle habits than those that were not taking glucosamine and chondroitin. Another observational study suggests that regular use of chondroitin with glucosamine for an average of 8 years is associated with a 30% lower risk of mortality when compared with no use. However, when these findings are adjusted for differences in age, body mass index, and comorbidities, overall mortality risk does not seem to be reduced with chondroitin and glucosamine supplementation (110626). Higher quality, prospective research is needed to clarify the relationship, if any, with overall mortality. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects on mortality are due to chondroitin, glucosamine, or the combination.\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral chondroitin sulfate is beneficial for reducing psoriasis disease severity.\nA clinical study in patients with plaque psoriasis and knee osteoarthritis shows that taking chondroitin sulfate (Condrosan, CS Bio-Active, Bioibérica S.A.) 800 mg daily for 3 months does not appear to reduce the extent or severity of plaque psoriasis when compared with placebo (42463).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral chondroitin sulfate is beneficial for reducing stroke risk.\nAn observational study in Spanish patients found that chondroitin sulfate use is associated with 23% lower odds of ischemic stroke when compared with non-use; however, the benefit was only observed in patients taking at least 800 mg for no more than one year (109643).\nless\nUrinary incontinence. Although there is interest in using intravesical chondroitin for urinary incontinence, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of chondroitin for this condition.\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if intravesical administration of chondroitin sulfate alone is beneficial in patients with recurrent UTIs. Most research has evaluated the effects of chondroitin sulfate in combination with hyaluronic acid, with promising results.\nOne small observational study in patients with recurrent UTIs has found that intravesical administration of 40 mL of chondroitin sulfate 0.2% weekly for 6 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 2 months, then every 3 weeks for 2 months, and finally every 6 weeks for a total treatment duration of 1 year is associated with a lower number of UTIs and urologist visits when compared with low-dose long-term antibiotic therapy (109649).\n\nMost research on the use of chondroitin sulfate for UTIs has evaluated its effects when used in combination with hyaluronic acid. Several small clinical studies and a pooled analysis of the available clinical research show that intravesical administration of 50 mL of specific solutions containing chondroitin sulfate 2% and hyaluronic acid 1.6% (iAluRil, IBSA Farmaceutici; Cystistat, Bioniche) for up to 6 months reduces the rate of UTI recurrence by about 2-3 incidents per year and delays the time to the first UTI recurrence when compared with placebo or prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (42511, 42519, 89590, 89594, 99688). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the low quality and high heterogeneity of the included studies, as well as concerns for publication bias (99688).\nless\nTemporomandibular disorders (TMD). Oral and topical chondroitin sulfate has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of two small clinical studies in patients with TMD shows that taking chondroitin sulfate 1200 mg and glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg daily for 2 months does not reduce pain or increase maximum mouth opening when compared with tramadol 50-100 mg daily (109647). Another small clinical trial in children aged 10-13 years with class II malocclusion shows that application of a specific combination gel product containing glucosamine, chondroitin, and essential oils (Jointace Gel, Vitabiotics) with an expander device twice daily for 3 months does not improve pain, tension, or temporomandibular space measures when compared with placebo (110629).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate chondroitin sulfate for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nChondroitin sulfate has most commonly been used as 800-1200 mg in divided or single daily doses for up to 2 years (94360, 94381, 95792, 99685). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nAll other routes:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nChondroitin sulfate used in many clinical trials is of bovine origin (42463, 89558, 89561). However, analysis of some chondroitin sulfate products suggests that potency may be inconsistent among different products, and the actual amount of chondroitin sulfate in some products may deviate from label claims (89597). Depending on the supplier, potency of chondroitin sulfate products available in the US and UK may range from 0% to over 115% (8128, 42542, 102116). This inconsistency may be due to the products being derived from different sources, produced using different manufacturing processes, or contamination (89598, 89599). One analysis of 25 chondroitin-containing products available in Europe found that most products contain chondroitin from multiple sources, including mixed animal sources or mixed animal and marine sources, regardless of the source stated on the label. Additionally, 100% of the tested products were contaminated with keratan sulfate, another glycosaminoglycan protein, with concentrations ranging from 10% to 47% (102116).\n\nOne oral liquid product (Esoxx, Alfa Wasserman Spa) containing chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid has been specially formulated with a bio-adhesive carrier (Lutrol F 127) to form a barrier with the esophageal mucosa and prolong its activity in the esophagus (99687).",
            "Interactions with Drugs": "WARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTaking chondroitin in combination with glucosamine might increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. However, the effect of chondroitin alone is unclear.\nThere have been multiple reports of increased international normalized ratio (INR) in patients taking warfarin with glucosamine, with or without chondroitin. The lack of reports with chondroitin alone seem to suggest that the interactions occurring in these reports may have been due to glucosamine. In two individual case reports, glucosamine/chondroitin combinations were associated with a significant increase in INR in patients previously stabilized on warfarin (11389, 16130). Additionally, 20 voluntary case reports to the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) have linked glucosamine plus chondroitin with increased INR, bruising, and bleeding in patients who were also taking warfarin (16130). There have also been 20 additional case reports to the World Health Organization (WHO) that link glucosamine alone, without chondroitin, to increased INR in patients taking warfarin (16131).\nless",
            "Interactions with Supplements": "GLUCOSAMINE\nTheoretically, concomitant use of glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate may reduce the absorption of glucosamine.\nClinical research shows that taking a single dose of chondroitin sulfate in combination with glucosamine hydrochloride reduces the maximal blood concentration (Cmax) of glucosamine. When a single dose of glucosamine hydrochloride is taken following 3 months of combined glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate supplementation, the Cmax is not affected; however, the AUC is reduced (42444). The clinical significance of this interaction is unclear.\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nASTHMA\nThere is concern that chondroitin might exacerbate asthma; use with caution. Patients with asthma tend to have higher concentrations of chondroitin antibodies in the airway compared to people without asthma (10002). Additionally, some research suggests that people with asthma have increased levels of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan deposits in the airway walls. Immunoreactivity to the proteoglycan appears to be correlated with airway responsiveness in these patients (10002, 13720). This suggests that chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan might have a role in airway wall remodeling in patient with asthma. In one case, an asthma patient developed difficult-to-control asthma exacerbations after starting a chondroitin-glucosamine product; symptoms resolved upon discontinuation. However, there is no evidence that exogenously administered glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin can actually cause asthma.\nless\nPROSTATE CANCER\nThere is concern that chondroitin might increase the risk of prostate cancer; use with caution. Preliminary clinical research suggests that chondroitin may be associated with the spread or recurrence of prostate cancer (8962). The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, versican, seems to facilitate invasion of cancer cells into the prostate stroma (11761). However, this effect has not been reported with supplemental chondroitin sulfate.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with chondroitin sulfate.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn some human and animal research, use of chondroitin sulfate did not alter plasma levels of chondroitin (4202, 10315, 42444). However, in other human research, a dose of oral chondroitin sulfate 3 grams resulted in a main peak (11.4 ± 3.7 mcg/mL) that occurred after 190 ± 21 minutes, which was followed by a lower peak (42362). Also, oral intake of chondroitin sulfate (Condrosulf) 4 grams increased chondroitin sulfate in plasma by at least 200%; peak concentrations were reached 2 hours following the dose (42340). Some evidence suggests that low molecular weight derivatives of chondroitin sulfate may be more readily absorbed than higher molecular weight derivatives (42542). Overall, pharmacokinetic studies indicate that oral absorption of chondroitin sulfate is relatively fast, but oral bioavailability is moderate (12% to 24%) (4203, 42362, 42435).\nDistribution\nIn human research, the half-life of the distribution of exogenous chondroitin was 25.5 ± 6.6 minutes, and the volumes of central and tissue compartments were 6.0 ± 1.0 and 22.9 ± 7.7 l, respectively (42362). Overall, pharmacokinetic studies indicate that oral intake of chondroitin sulfate results in its depolymerization and degradation, but after time, it may accumulate in target joints (42435).\nMetabolism\nIn human research, the plasma levels of exogenous chondroitin sulfate decreased according to a two-compartmental open model (42362). Overall, pharmacokinetic studies indicate that oral intake of chondroitin sulfate results in its depolymerization and degradation (42435).\nExcretion\nUrinary excretion as high- and low-molecular-weight breakdown products is the main route of elimination of chondroitin sulfate (4203). In human research, the half-life of the elimination of exogenous chondroitin was 281 ± 32 minutes, and >50% was excreted in the urine during the first 24 hours as high- and low-molecular-weight derivatives (42362).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nChondroitin sulfate belongs to a class of very large molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are made up of glucuronic acid and galactosamine (42378). Chondroitin is manufactured from natural sources, such as shark and bovine cartilage, or produced synthetically (42335). Pure chondroitin is a relatively large molecule, weighing about 16,900 daltons. The species or tissue of origin, and the extraction method used, can affect the size of the molecule (8128).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn chondrocytes, chondroitin sulfate has been suggested to reduce the interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta-induced increases in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation resulting in a decrease in the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and the reduction of proinflammatory cytokine and enzyme production (42417). In vitro, chondroitin 4-sulfate was found to play a role in the regulation of IL-8 secretion (42405).\nAnticoagulant effects\nSince chondroitin is a minor component, approximately 4%, of the low molecular weight heparinoid mixture, danaparoid (Orgaran), some concern has been expressed about possible anticoagulant activity of chondroitin sulfate. However, significant hematological changes have not been found in studies (760). In fact, some studies in humans have used concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with chondroitin sulfate for up to 6 months without reports of adverse effects (322, 42339).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that exogenous chondroitin sulfate regulates fibrosarcoma cell adhesion, motility, and migration through JNK and tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (42407).\n\nThere is also some evidence that chondroitin might be useful in cancer monitoring. There is evidence that measurements of endogenous chondroitin sulfate in the peritumoral stromal tissue of the prostate can be a useful biomarker in the disease progression of prostate cancer. The concentration of chondroitin sulfate is increased in the prostate tissue of adults with prostate cancer when compared to tissue samples of cancer-free patients. When used with the Gleason score and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, the peritumoral chondroitin sulfate measurement can allow practitioners to more accurately assess the progression of prostate cancer (8962).\nAntiviral effects\nEarly evidence suggesting chondroitin might show promise as an HIV therapy adjunct has been refuted. More recent laboratory information suggests that chondroitin does not have anti-HIV activity (1263, 1335, 8662). However, preliminary research suggests that the chemically oversulfated form of chondroitin has activity against HIV, herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, and dengue virus (10616, 42493).\nBladder effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that chondroitin or other GAGs might prevent calcium oxalate crystallization in the urinary tract (8127). Evidence from animal research suggests that chondroitin sulfate can restore bladder permeability (42431).\nBone effects\nChondroitin sulfate has been used as part of scaffolding with collagen and other tissues to aid in bone defect treatment in animal models (42491, 42499).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome researchers think chondroitin might have cardiovascular applications due to potential antiatherogenic properties. Laboratory studies suggest that chondroitin might protect against atherosclerosis (1955, 8125). Also, preliminary clinical research suggests that chondroitin sulfate may lower cholesterol levels in humans when used for 64 months (42528).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is some interest in using chondroitin sulfate to modify the gut microbiota. A small clinical study in 11 healthy volunteers shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride 1500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 1200 mg daily for 14 days does not affect the concentration and quantity of the seven most common bacterial phyla found in the gut; however, it might alter the quantity of some bacterial genera when compared with placebo. It is unclear if these changes would affect gut health (102117).\nJoint effects\nPeople use chondroitin for osteoarthritis because it is endogenously found in cartilaginous tissues of most mammals and serves as a substrate for the formation of the joint matrix structure (1973, 6738). There is some evidence that chondroitin sulfate protects cartilage against degradation by inhibiting the action of the enzymes leukocyte elastase and hyaluronidase or increasing hyaluronan synthases, by decreasing the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and by increasing the synthesis of collagen, proteoglycans, and hyaluronic acid (4203, 6738, 42400, 42427). Also, data from in vitro studies and animal models suggest that the efficacy of chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis might be partly due to inhibition of proinflammatory pathways that lead to downregulation of ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) enzymes (42376, 42455), possibly by affecting gene expression and inflammatory mediator production, including cytokines and prostaglandins (42450). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that chondroitin and glucosamine enhanced chondrogenesis from mesenchymal stem cells (42374).\nNeurologic effects\nThe neuroprotective effects of chondroitin sulfate include forming perineuronal nets, protective against oxidative stress potentially involved in neurodegeneration, activation of the signaling pathway PKC/PI3K/Akt, induction of the antioxidant enzyme hemoxygenase-1, protection of cortical neurons against excitotoxic death by phosphorylation of intracellular signals, and the suppression of caspase-3 activation (42462).\nOphthalmologic effects\nChondroitin has viscoelastic properties making it useful for ophthalmologic applications (42505). In in vitro and in ex vivo organ cultures of the cornea, chondroitin sulfate inhibited adhesion of Candida albicans (42508).\nWound-healing effects\nIn vitro, chondroitin sulfate increased cell adhesion and induced proliferation and migration of fibroblasts. MAPK signaling pathways were implicated (42488)."

            "Overview": "Chromium is a trace mineral. It exists in two forms: trivalent and hexavalent states. Trivalent chromium (Cr III), the form found in foods and supplements, is biologically active and safe (42626). The other form of chromium, hexavalent chromium (Cr VI), is a known toxin that can cause skin problems and lung cancer following long-term occupational exposure (9141, 42572, 42648). Unless otherwise noted, the information in this monograph pertains only to trivalent chromium.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, short-term. Chromium has been safely used in doses up to 1000 mcg daily for up to 6 months (1934, 5039, 5040, 6858, 6859, 6860, 6861, 6862, 6867, 6868)(7135, 7137, 10309, 13053, 14325, 14440, 17224, 90057, 90061)(90063, 94234, 95095, 95096, 95097, 98687); however, most of these studies have used chromium doses in a range of 150-600 mcg. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Institute of Medicine (IOM) evaluations of the safety of chromium suggest that it is safe when used in doses of 200 mcg daily for up to 6 months (13241, 13242).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, long-term. Chromium has been safely used in a small number of studies at doses of 200-1000 mcg daily for up to 2 years (7060, 7135, 42618, 42628, 42666, 110605, 110607, 110609). However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Institute of Medicine (IOM) evaluations of the safety of chromium suggest that it is safe when used in doses of 200 mcg daily for up to 6 months (13241, 13242).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in amounts not exceeding the daily adequate intake (AI) levels by age: 0-6 months, 0.2 mcg; 7-12 months, 5.5 mcg; 1-3 years, 11 mcg; 4-8 years, 15 mcg; males 9-13 years, 25 mcg; males 14-18 years, 35 mcg; females 9-13 years, 21 mcg; females 14-18 years, 24 mcg (7135). POSSIBLY SAFE...when used orally and appropriately in amounts exceeding AI levels. Chromium 400 mcg daily has been used safely for up to 6 weeks (42680).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in amounts not exceeding adequate intake (AI) levels. The AI for pregnancy is 28 mcg daily for those 14-18 years of age and 30 mcg daily for those 19-50 years of age (7135).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in amounts exceeding the adequate intake (AI) levels. There is some evidence that patients with gestational diabetes can safely use chromium in doses of 4-8 mcg/kg (1953); however, patients should not take chromium supplements during pregnancy without medical supervision.\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in amounts not exceeding adequate intake (AI) levels. The AI for lactation is 44 mcg daily for those 14-18 years of age and 45 mcg daily for those 19-50 years of age (7135). Chromium supplements do not seem to increase normal chromium concentration in human breast milk (1937). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of chromium when used in higher amounts while breast-feeding.",

Also, chromium picolinate or chromium chloride may cause systemic contact dermatitis when taken orally, especially in patients with contact allergy to chromium (6624, 90058). In one clinical study, a patient taking chromium nicotinate 50 mcg daily reported itchy palms that improved after the intervention was discontinued. It is unclear of this effect was due to the chromium or another factor (95096).\n\nIntravenously, chromated glycerin administered during sclerotherapy was associated with allergic contact dermatitis that developed 2 days after the procedure and was confirmed by patch testing (116988).\n\nTopically, hexavalent chromium, which can be present in some cement, leather products, or contaminated soil, may cause allergic contact dermatitis (42645, 42789, 90060, 90064, 110606).\n\nA case of lichen planus has been reported for a patient following long-term occupational exposure to chromium (42688).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, cases of hypoglycemia have been reported for patients taking chromium picolinate 200-1000 mcg daily alone or 200-300 mcg two or three times weekly in combination with insulin (42672, 42783). Chromium picolinate has also been associated with weight gain in young females who do not exercise and in those following a weight-lifting program (1938).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, chromium in the form of chromium picolinate, chromium polynicotinate, chromium-containing brewer's yeast, or chromium-containing milk powder may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, constipation, flatulence, or gastrointestinal upset (14325, 42594, 42607, 42622, 42643, 42679).\n\nLong-term exposure to heavy metals, including chromium, has been associated with increased risk of gallbladder disease and cancer (42682, 42704).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, chromium polynicotinate has been associated with disrupted menstrual cycles in patients taking the supplement to prevent weight gain during smoking cessation (42643).\nless\nHematologic\nAnemia, hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia were reported in a 33 year-old female taking chromium picolinate 1200-2400 mcg daily for 4-5 months (554). The patient received supportive care, blood product transfusions, and hemodialysis and was stabilized and discharged a few days later. Lab values were normal at a one-year follow-up.\nless\nHepatic\nLiver damage has been reported for a 33-year-old female taking chromium picolinate 1200 mcg daily for 4-5 months (554). Also, acute hepatitis has been reported in a patient taking chromium polynicotinate 200 mcg daily for 5 months (9141). Symptoms resolved when the product was discontinued. Two cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients who took a specific combination product (Hydroxycut), which also contained chromium polynicotinate in addition to several herbs (13037).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nAcute rhabdomyolysis has been reported for a previously healthy 24-year-old female who ingested chromium picolinate 1200 mcg over a 48-hour time period (42786). Also, chromium polynicotinate has been associated with leg pain and paresthesia in patients taking the supplement to prevent weight gain during smoking cessation (42643).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, chromium picolinate may cause headache, paresthesia, insomnia, dizziness, and vertigo (6860, 10309, 14325, 42594). Vague cognitive symptoms, slowed thought processes, and difficulty driving occurred on three separate occasions in a healthy 35-year-old male after oral intake of chromium picolinate 200-400 mcg (42751). Transient increases in dreaming have been reported in three patients with dysthymia treated with chromium picolinate in combination with sertraline (2659). A specific combination product (Hydroxycut) containing chromium, caffeine, and ephedra has been associated with seizures (10307). But the most likely causative agent in this case is ephedra.\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, chromium picolinate has been associated with irritability and mood changes in patients taking the supplement to lose weight, while chromium polynicotinate has been associated with agitation and mood changes in patients taking the supplement to prevent weight gain during smoking cessation (6860, 42643).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, chromium picolinate has been associated with at least one report of chronic interstitial nephritis and two reports of acute tubular necrosis (554, 1951, 14312). Laboratory evidence suggests that chromium does not cause kidney tissue damage even after long-term, high-dose exposure (7135); however, patient- or product-specific factors could potentially increase the risk of chromium-related kidney damage. More evidence is needed to determine what role, if any, chromium has in potentially causing kidney damage.\n\nIntravenously, chromium is associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in children who receive long-term chromium-containing total parenteral nutrition - TPN (11787).\n\nTopically, burns caused by chromic acid, a hexavalent form of chromium, have been associated with acute chromium poisoning with acute renal failure (42699). Early excision of affected skin and dialysis are performed to prevent systemic toxicity.\nless\nOther\nAnother form of chromium, called hexavalent chromium, is unsafe. This type of chromium is a by-product of some manufacturing processes. Chronic exposure can cause liver, kidney, or cardiac failure, pulmonary complications, anemia, and hemolysis (9141, 11786, 42572, 42573, 42699). Occupational inhalation of hexavalent chromium can cause ulceration of the nasal mucosa and perforation of the nasal septum, and has been associated with pneumoconiosis, allergic asthma, cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and increased susceptibility to respiratory tract cancer and even stomach and germ cell cancers (42572, 42573, 42601, 42610, 42636, 42667, 42648, 42601, 42788, 90056, 90066). Although rare, cases of interstitial pneumonia associated with chromium inhalation have been reported. Symptoms resolved with corticosteroid treatment (42614).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nChromium deficiency. Oral or parenteral chromium is effective for the treatment and prevention of chromium deficiency.\nChromium is effective for preventing and treating symptoms of chromium deficiency, including hyperglycemia, glycosuria, sudden weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, and confusion (7135).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Oral chromium seems to be modestly beneficial for improving glycemic control in diabetes, especially when used in doses greater than 200 mcg daily and in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. It is unclear if chromium helps to prevent the development of diabetes.\nEpidemiological research has found that lower toenail chromium levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (11908). In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a qualified health claim stating that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the FDA has determined that any relationship between chromium picolinate and type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain and is based on limited scientific evidence (102362).\n\nResearch on the use of chromium for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is conflicting but seems to show modest benefit in some patients. Several clinical studies, most including fewer than 80 patients with type 2 diabetes, show that taking chromium decreases fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and increases insulin sensitivity (6867, 7137, 12390, 14440, 15169, 42628, 42638, 95097, 103745). However, other small clinical studies show that chromium is no better than placebo for improving most glycemic indices in patients with diabetes (7060, 14325, 42679, 42707, 90059, 103746, 103749). Some of these studies may not have been adequately powered and some had a high risk of bias. Furthermore, these studies had high heterogeneity related to study population and size, chromium supplementation duration, formulation, and dose, and accepted standards of diabetes care. Multiple meta-analyses pooling results of these small clinical trials also show mixed results (90055, 90063, 95098, 105026, 110610, 111420). The most recent of the aforementioned meta-analyses show that chromium picolinate lowers HbA1c by about 0.6%, with conflicting findings related to fasting blood glucose and measures of insulin resistance (110610, 111420). It is unclear if chromium yeast, chromium dinicocysteinate, or chromium with biotin or other natural ingredients are beneficial. Chromium seems to be most beneficial in doses of greater than 200 mcg taken for 12 weeks or longer, and in patients with poorly controlled diabetes with a baseline HbA1c of 8% or greater (90063, 105026). There is also speculation that chromium might primarily benefit patients with low chromium levels; however, there has not been an analysis specifically evaluating this population (6867, 7058, 13725, 14325, 95098).\n\nSome research suggests that chromium might also modestly improve lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (1934, 6867, 95098). A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 5-26 weeks decreases triglyceride levels by 7 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 2 mg/dL when compared with control. Taking chromium did not affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, the validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity (110605). Another meta-analysis failed to demonstrate any effects of chromium on lipid levels (110610).\n\nResearch on chromium's effect on blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes is mixed. A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 8-25 weeks lowers diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg, but does not improve systolic blood pressure or body mass index, when compared with placebo (110607).\n\nChromium does not seem to improve body composition in patients with type 2 diabetes, including fat mass, body mass index, waist circumference, or body weight compared with control (116991).\n\nPreliminary clinical research shows that chromium picolinate might improve metabolic parameters in patients with other forms of diabetes as well. This includes those with type 1 diabetes (1935), diabetes secondary to corticosteroid use (5039, 42829), and gestational diabetes (42817).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nHypertension. Meta-analyses of small clinical trials suggest that oral chromium does not lower blood pressure by a clinically meaningful amount.\nA meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with different metabolic disorders shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 12-24 weeks does not lower systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (110609). A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with different chronic disorders shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 4-25 weeks lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo. However, the validity of this meta-analysis is limited by high heterogeneity (110604). Another meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials including patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 8-25 weeks lowers diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg, but not systolic blood pressure, when compared with placebo (110607). In addition, the validity of these results is limited by inclusion of patients with and without hypertension at baseline (110604, 110607, 110609).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Oral chromium does not seem to improve glycemic indices in patients with prediabetes.\nSome clinical research shows that adults with impaired glucose tolerance do not have improved glycemic parameters or insulin sensitivity after taking chromium picolinate 500-1000 mcg daily for up to 6 months when compared with placebo (13053, 42670). Likewise, a small clinical study in elderly patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that chromium supplements do not improve glucose tolerance or triglyceride or cholesterol levels when compared with placebo (13722). Finally, a preliminary clinical study in overweight or obese adults with prediabetes shows that taking two capsules of a combination product containing chromium, cinnamon, and carnosine (Glycabiane, PiLeJe) daily for 4 months decreases fasting plasma glucose by approximately 4 mg/dL when compared with placebo, but does not improve fasting plasma insulin, measures of insulin sensitivity or resistance, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (94234). The small effect on fasting plasma glucose is clinically insignificant and may be due to the other ingredients in this product.\nless\nSchizophrenia. Oral chromium does not seem to improve psychological measures in patients with schizophrenia.\nClinical research in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking chromium polynicotinate 400 mcg daily for 3 months does not affect weight or mental status when compared with placebo (42613).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAntiretroviral-induced insulin resistance. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial for preventing antiretroviral-induced insulin resistance.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with HIV treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) shows that taking chromium nicotinate 200 mcg or chromium picolinate 1000 mcg daily for 8-16 weeks may help decrease insulin resistance and increase glucose disposal when compared to baseline (42630, 42662). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if chromium enhances athletic performance, although some research suggests that it may improve body composition when used in conjunction with exercise.\nOne large clinical study shows taking chromium 400 mcg daily, in conjunction with resistance training, can increase weight loss, body fat loss, and lean body mass when compared with placebo in conjunction with resistance training (6868). However, other, very small clinical studies show that adding chromium picolinate or chromium chloride 177-400 mcg daily to a weight-training program does not improve body composition when compared with weight-training alone (6860, 6861, 6862, 42747). These studies may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference in outcomes.\nless\nAtypical depression. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with atypical depression.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with atypical depression shows that taking chromium picolinate 400 mcg daily for 2 weeks followed by 600 mcg daily for an additional 6 weeks improves response and remission rates when compared with placebo (10309). However, other clinical research shows that taking elemental chromium 400 mcg in the form of chromium picolinate daily for 2 weeks followed by 600 mcg daily for an additional 6 weeks does not improve most symptoms of atypical depression, although appetite and sexual drive may improve, when compared with placebo (42600).\nless\nBeta blocker-induced dyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with dyslipidemia due to beta-blocker use.\nOne small clinical study in patients who take beta-blockers shows that taking glucose tolerance factor (GTF)-chromium 600 mcg daily for 2 months increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 16%, but does not affect other lipid parameters, when compared with placebo (5040).\nless\nBinge eating disorder. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with binge eating disorder.\nOne small clinical study in adults with overweight and binge eating disorder shows that taking chromium picolinate 600 or 1000 mcg daily for 6 months does not affect binge eating frequency, body weight, or depressive symptoms when compared with placebo (90057).\nless\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar disorder.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with treatment-resistant, rapid-cycling bipolar disorder shows that taking chromium chloride (Hypo-A Chrom, Hypo-A GmbH) 600-800 mcg daily for up to 2 years can decrease the frequency of affective episodes by approximately three episodes annually when compared to baseline (42618). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral chromium prevents or treats cognitive impairment.\nSome clinical research shows that taking chromium picolinate standardized to contain elemental chromium 1000 mcg daily for 12 weeks does not improve memory or depression in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment when compared with placebo. However, results from neuroimaging scans suggest that chromium increases the activity of certain regions of the brain during memory tasks when compared with placebo (42666).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral chromium may modestly reduce lipid levels in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nOne small clinical study in patients with atherosclerotic disease shows that taking chromium 250 mcg as chromium chloride daily for 7-16 months decreases triglycerides and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but not other lipid parameters, when compared with placebo (7060). Other small clinical studies in adults with hyperlipidemia show that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily for 6 weeks, chromium polynicotinate 200 mcg twice daily, or brewer's yeast containing 48 mcg elemental chromium daily for 6-8 weeks decrease total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared to baseline (37178, 42585, 42710). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of comparison with a control group.\n\nA meta-analysis of small heterogeneous clinical studies in patients mostly without hyperlipidemia shows that taking chromium does not affect lipid levels when compared with placebo (105029). A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials including patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 5-26 weeks modestly improves triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, but not LDL cholesterol levels, when compared with control. However, the validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity and inclusion of patients with and without hyperlipidemia (110605). In addition, some meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate any effects of chromium on lipid levels in adults with diabetes (110610).\n\nLimited research has tested high-dose chromium in children. One small clinical study in children with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking chromium polynicotinate 400-600 mcg with glucomannan 1000-1500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces total and LDL cholesterol when compared to baseline (90061). It is unclear if this effect is due to chromium, glucomannan, or the combination.\nless\nHypoglycemia. It is unclear if oral chromium helps to reverse or prevent hypoglycemia.\nOne very small clinical study in patients with reactive hypoglycemia shows that taking chromium chloride 200 mcg daily for 3 months increases blood glucose levels and improves insulin binding and hypoglycemic symptoms following an oral glucose load (6859). Another small clinical study in patients with symptomatic hypoglycemia shows that taking chromium yeast (Biochrome, Pharma-Nord) 125 mcg daily for 3 months improves symptoms, including chilliness, trembling, and disorientation, when compared with baseline (42711). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nOne small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a particular chromium picolinate product (Chromax, Nutrition 21) 500 mcg twice daily for 16 weeks does not affect weight, waist circumference, insulin sensitivity, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), or lipid levels when compared with placebo (42654).\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if oral chromium helps to prevent MI.\nEpidemiological research has found that low toenail chromium concentrations are associated with an increased risk of MI (13728). However, toenail chromium concentrations might not be a reliable predictor of body stores of chromium. There is also no reliable research showing that chromium supplements can prevent MI.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral chromium slows NAFLD progression.\nOne small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg two times daily after meals for 12 weeks does not affect liver enzyme levels or body weight when compared with placebo (105027).\nless\nObesity. Although some research suggests that oral chromium may increase weight loss, this effect is not likely to be considered clinically relevant.\nMeta-analyses of clinical studies, many of which are lower quality, in adults with overweight or obesity show that taking various forms of chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 12-16 weeks might result in a cumulative weight loss of about 0.5-1 kg, a reduction in body mass index of 0.4 kg/m2, and a slight reduction in body fat when compared with placebo (90062, 90065, 116990). However, these small changes are unlikely to be considered clinically significant. Additionally, small clinical studies, some of which are included in the meta-analyses discussed above, in healthy adults and children with overweight or obesity show that taking oral chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 6-24 weeks does not reduce weight when compared with control (6860, 13727, 17224, 42680). Some of these studies may not have been adequately powered to detect a smaller effect.\n\nTwo meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials among adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 8-25 weeks does not lower body mass index, fat mass, waist circumference, or body weight when compared with control. However, the validity of these results is limited by inclusion of patients with and without obesity at baseline (110607, 116991).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral chromium improves symptoms of PCOS.\nOne small clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking chromium picolinate 1000 mcg daily for 6 months along with diet and exercise counseling decreases body mass index and improves rates of ovulation and regular menstruation when compared with placebo (95094). Also, some clinical research shows that taking chromium picolinate (21st Century HealthCare, Inc. or Nature Made) 200 mcg daily for 8 weeks increases insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo (95095, 98687). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily for 4 months does not affect insulin sensitivity or improve ovulation rates (42603). Although chromium picolinate at doses of less than 1000 mcg might have very small effects on fasting glucose, these doses do not seem to have clinically beneficial effects on fasting glucose, pregnancy rate, or testosterone levels (95094, 95095, 98687).\n\nA lower dose of chromium has also been studied in combination with carnitine. One small clinical study in adults with overweight and PCOS shows that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily with carnitine 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and body weight, and slightly increases insulin sensitivity, when compared with placebo (103747). However, it is unclear if this benefit is clinically significant. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to chromium, carnitine, or the combination. Carnitine has demonstrated clinical benefit when used alone in PCOS.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if chromium is beneficial for RA.\nA small clinical study in adults with RA shows that taking trivalent chromium, approximately 3.5 mcg/kg daily, for 12 weeks improves measures of disease activity, function, and pain when compared with baricitinib. Additionally, there is improvement in synovitis, but not joint effusions (116989).\nless\nTurner syndrome. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nA small clinical study shows that taking brewer's yeast 30 grams containing chromium 50 mcg daily for 8 weeks might improve abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism when compared with baseline in patients with Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that has a high incidence of diabetes (13729). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate chromium for these uses.",

Chromium may also come in the form of brewer's yeast or chromium yeast (95098). Chromium picolinate is a complex of chromium and picolinic acid, which is a naturally occurring metabolic derivative of tryptophan. It contains 12.4% elemental trivalent chromium (2659, 95094). Chromium polynicotinate is often referred to as niacin-bound chromium because it includes chromium bound to molecules of niacin (2659).",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nAcute chromium toxicity can cause vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and blood loss into the gastrointestinal tract resulting in cardiogenic shock (11786).\n\nAnother form of chromium, called hexavalent chromium (CR VI), is 100 times more toxic than trivalent chromium. Industrial hexavalent chromium is considered cytotoxic and genotoxic (6863, 42658, 42663, 42686, 42693). It penetrates the cells easily (unlike trivalent chromium) and appears to induce oxidative damage to DNA (7326, 42565, 42749, 42778).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with chromium.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen ingested, most chromium is excreted unabsorbed in the feces. The small percentage that is absorbed, typically 0.4% to 2.5%, is rapidly excreted in the urine (7135). Approximately 0.5% to 2% of chromium is absorbed (42740, 42725).\n\nAdding the picolinate or nicotinate salt increases absorption, retention, and accumulation of chromium compared to inorganic salts such as chromium chloride (6861, 6864, 9141, 95096, 95098). Nicotinate may also have increased bioavailability over picolinate (95096). Some manufacturers suggest that chromium polynicotinate is better absorbed than chromium picolinate, but there is no scientific support for this claim.\nDistribution\nAfter absorption, chromium is bound to transferrin (6869). The distribution may occur across fast, medium, and slow compartments, with serum chromium not in equilibrium with tissue-organ stores (42811). Once absorbed, chromium concentrates in the kidney, heart, liver, brain, muscle, spleen, testes, epididymis, and lungs (6863).\n\nChromium retention decreases with aging, as found in a very large collection of hair, sweat, and serum samples (7058). It is unclear whether this is due to inadequate nutrition or normal physiology (42779).\nExcretion\nThe small percentage of chromium that is absorbed is rapidly excreted in the urine (7135, 42579). Stressors, such as elevated blood sugar, strenuous physical activity or work, infection, and emotional and physical trauma, may increase the excretion of chromium (37163, 42721, 42744, 42748).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nChromium (Cr) is a white, hard, brittle metal that is an essential trace element. The activity of chromium depends on its valance state. Metallic chromium, or chromium 0, has no activity. The other two common forms, chromium III (Cr III) and chromium VI (Cr VI), have different activities. Cr VI is typically used in chemical and welding industries and is carcinogenic to humans. Cr III is the form found in foods and supplements (13721).\n\nChromium is sometimes referred to as glucose tolerance factor (GTF), but GTF is actually a complex of molecules found in the body that includes chromium bound to single molecules of glycine, cysteine, glutamic acid, and two molecules of nicotinic acid. Chromium is thought to be the active component of the complex. Some dietary sources of chromium include canned foods (due to chromium leaching from the can), meats and animal fats, fish, brown sugar, coffee, tea, some spices, calf liver, whole wheat bread, rye bread, and brewer's yeast (7061).\n\nSymptomatic chromium deficiency is rare. When it does occur, it is most often due to malnutrition, pregnancy, stress, or long-term use of chromium deficient total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Symptoms include severe glucose intolerance, weight loss, and metabolic encephalopathy (6863, 13730). Although not yet confirmed, some researchers suspect that tissue levels of chromium might decline with age (6863).\nAntidiabetes effects\nPeople with diabetes may have lower chromium levels (7058, 11908, 13725). Low chromium levels are associated with impaired glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism, and resultant increased cardiovascular risk (95097). Some athletes might also be at risk for low chromium levels since strenuous aerobic exercise seems to increase urinary excretion of chromium (6860, 6861). However, exercise-induced losses seem to be less in those who regularly exercise (6862). People who strength train seem to have increased absorption of chromium (7136). It is difficult to measure chromium status to determine who might require supplementation. Blood chromium levels are not in equilibrium with chromium stores and, therefore, do not provide a good indicator of chromium status (6859). However, elevated blood chromium levels may indicate excessive chromium exposure (11786). Levels in the urine and hair do not reflect overall chromium status (6867). There is no reliable method available to diagnose chromium deficiency, other than observing the outcome following supplementation in patients suspected of being deficient (3859, 6869). Symptoms of chromium deficiency can include impaired insulin function and glucose tolerance, leading to elevations in insulin and fasting hyperglycemia, impairments in growth, increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, neuropathy, weight loss, decreased respiratory function, and nitrogen metabolism abnormalities (6863, 6869, 11786, 95098).\n\nDiscovery of the role of chromium in insulin function occurred when patients on long-term TPN developed symptoms of diabetes that did not respond to insulin, but were reversed by chromium (6869, 42641, 42787). Because of the symptoms associated with chromium deficiency, researchers have speculated that chromium supplementation might be an effective treatment for diabetes. There is some evidence that patients with diabetes might have lower than normal levels of chromium due to increased chromium excretion (6858). However, patients with diabetes also seem to have increased gastrointestinal absorption of chromium. It's also theorized that patients with diabetes may not be able to adequately convert chromium from the diet to a usable form in the body (6867). Chromium seems to be transported to insulin-sensitive cells by transferrin, in response to increases in plasma insulin levels (6869). It is suspected to potentiate insulin by increasing receptor numbers and affinity, and increasing insulin binding to cells (6859, 6867). Chromium increases insulin sensitivity through activation of signaling pathways involved with glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), leading to translocation (95097). Chromium may also enhance the synthesis of insulin receptor mRNA as well as insulin-like growth factor receptors (95097). A single oral dose of chromium before a high carbohydrate meal seems to lessen postprandial hyperglycemia in healthy, young volunteers. This suggests chromium potentiates the effect of insulin (13726). Additionally, chromium picolinate has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and stimulate insulin receptor sites in patients with type 2 diabetes (42554).\n\nOther clinical research shows that chromium dinicocysteinate can reduce insulin resistance by reducing oxidative stress and blood levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes (42707). However, chromium picolinate does not appear to have these effects. In animal models, a chromium-containing peptide called chromodulin has been identified, which potentiates the actions of insulin at its receptors, including activation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity (6869). Additionally, in laboratory study, chromium activated trafficking of glucose transporter-4 and increased insulin-stimulated glucose transport through a cholesterol-dependent mechanism (42602). In patients with diabetes, these actions seem to translate into decreased insulin resistance, improved glucose tolerance, and lower blood glucose levels (6862). Researchers are interested in chromium for treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome due to its potential effects on lipids and body composition.\n\nSome clinical research shows that chromium might reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and thereby some of the adverse effects and complications of diabetes (13724). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults, most of whom have diabetes, shows that chromium supplementation is associated with modest reductions in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and TNF-alpha when compared with control (105030). But the clinical significance of this is not known.\n\nClinical research suggests that adding 100 mg of nicotinic acid 200 mcg of chromium chloride significantly improves glucose metabolism (11687); the effects of chromium may be augmented by nicotinic acid.\nAntioxidant effects\nChromium is considered to have antioxidant effects (13724, 42785). In human research, chromium dinicocysteinate supplementation significantly lowered protein carbonyl levels, a marker of protein oxidation, from baseline in diabetic patients (42707). Another study in diabetic patients reported an improvement in plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (30863). In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, chromium lowered levels of malondialdehyde (98687). A meta-analysis of patients with diabetes and other chronic disorders shows that taking chromium 400-1000 mcg daily for 8-24 weeks improves some markers of oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde levels, when compared with control; however other markers, such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels, were not improved (110608). Some clinical research also shows that chromium might reduce oxidative stress in patients with diabetes; however, in patients without diabetes, chromium might act as a pro-oxidant (13724).\nBone-resorption effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that chromium extract may increase the release of bone-resorbing cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, when used as an alloying element in metallic implants, chromium may increase tissue damage and bone resorption surrounding a metallic implant (42784).\nGenetic effects\nAlthough laboratory studies have shown that trivalent chromium compounds can produce chromosome or DNA oxidative damage, human studies have not demonstrated these findings (42790). On the other hand, hexavalent chromium penetrates the cells easily (unlike trivalent chromium) and appears to induce oxidative damage to DNA (7326, 42565, 42749, 42778).\nGrowth effects\nThere is interest in using chromium to enhance muscle protein synthesis. In the presence of sufficient essential amino acids or protein, insulin stimulates muscle protein synthesis. With low amounts of essential amino acids, insulin inhibits protein breakdown and has minimal effects on the rate of muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, it has been speculated that an improvement in insulin signaling combined with adequate doses of essential amino acids, could affect muscle protein synthesis (95099). Chromium is hypothesized to increase muscle mass by increasing amino acid uptake into muscle cells via potentiation of insulin activity (6862, 42813). Laboratory research suggests that chromium picolinate increases internalization of insulin and increases leucine uptake in muscle cells. Because of its effects on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) translocation, and its ability to increase insulin response through the AMPK pathway, chromium has been used in clinical research to improve muscle protein synthesis. In one small clinical study in healthy young adults, taking a suboptimal dose of whey protein isolate (BiPro USA) 6 grams and a combination product containing chromium picolinate/histidinate and amylopectin (Velositol, Nutrition 21, LLC) 2 grams, followed by acute resistance exercise, significantly increased the muscle fractional synthesis rate compared to whey protein alone (95099).\n\nAlso, evidence from animal research suggests that chromium supplementation can increase growth rate in mice and rats (42733).\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that chromium extract reduces cell proliferation and inhibits interleukin (IL)-2-dependent response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to phytohemagglutinin. Thus, when used as an alloying element in metallic implants, chromium may reduce lymphocyte-mediated immune response to an infection that develops in tissue surrounding a metallic implant (42784).\nLipid effects\nChromium inhibits the hepatic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase leading to interference of cholesterol metabolism (95097).\nNeurologic effects\nIt is theorized that chromium might enhance glucose utilization in the brain and stimulate norepinephrine release (2659). There is also interest in using chromium as an adjunct to antidepressant medications in people with depression. Preliminary clinical research suggests that chromium decreases endocrine responses to serotonin receptor stimulation, which could produce antidepressant activity (8929). A case series of adults with persistent depressive disorder shows that chromium supplementation might improve response to antidepressants, such as sertraline and amitriptyline, in patients with inadequate response (2659). However, clinical research in patients with atypical depression has yielded conflicting results (10309, 42600).\nWeight loss effects\nClinical research shows that ingestion of chromium picolinate reduces fat cravings, food intake, and hunger, which may lead to weight loss (42634). Chromium may induce these effects by affecting the brain's hunger receptors. Some research suggests that chromium might sensitize insulin-sensitive glucoreceptors in the brain, resulting in appetite suppression, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, stimulation of thermogenesis, and down-regulation of insulin secretion (6170, 6860)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe dried chrysanthemum flower contains the essential oil bornol, chrysantheonon, camphor, the alkaloid stachydrine, and several glycosides. It also contains adenine, choline, B vitamins, and substances similar to vitamin A (5545). Many other constituents have been isolated from the edible flower extract of chrysanthemum including alantolactone, taraxastanes, faradiol, heliantriols, arnidiol, faradiol alpha-epoxide, oleananes, maniladiol, erythrodiol, longispinogenin, coflodiol, ursanes, brein, uvaol, and calenduladiol (42842, 42853, 42890). Flavonoids include luteolin, apigenin, acacetin, chlorogenic acid, diosmetin, and their derivatives (106309). The therapeutic effects of chrysanthemum are thought to be due to its flavonoid and phenolic acid content (100229).\nAnti-inflammatory activity\nThere is interest in chrysanthemum for its cooling and anti-inflammatory effects. In vitro, chrysanthemum flower water extract inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E-2 production in a dose-dependent manner (42855). In vitro evidence shows that water and methanolic chrysanthemum extracts have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties (42865, 42860, 100229).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPreliminary information suggests the chrysanthemum product jiangtangkang used by individuals with non-insulin dependent diabetes might improve insulin sensitivity and decrease blood viscosity (5546). However, this product also contains chromium, so it is unclear if the effects are due to chrysanthemum, chromium, or the combination.\nAntitumor effects\nThere is interest in chrysanthemum for its anticancer effects. In vitro research shows constituents from chrysanthemum have inhibitory effects against Epstein-Barr virus early antigen activation comparable with to that of glycyrrhetic acid, a known natural antitumor-promoter (42853).\nAntiviral effects\nThe chrysanthemum constituents chrysin, acetin-7-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside, and apigenin 7-O-beta-D-(4'-caffeoyl) glucuronide inhibit HIV replication in vitro (5545, 8171, 42857, 42892).\nBone and cartilage effects\nChrysanthemum is of interest for osteoarthritis. Laboratory research suggests that chrysanthemum inhibits the differentiation and formation of osteoclasts from bone marrow cells. Chrysanthemum has also been found to reduce inflammation in vitro and in an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis. However, in human research, chrysanthemum had no effect on bone and cartilage biomarkers in plasma or urine (106308).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome evidence suggests that chrysanthemum might increase coronary vasodilatation and blood flow without increasing coronary contractility or oxygen consumption. Chrysanthemum may also have antibacterial and antipyretic effects. It may also reduce the capillary permeability induced by histamine (5545). In an animal model of renovascular hypertension leading to myocardial fibrosis, chrysanthemum reduced the degree of myocardial fibrosis, possibly by reducing blood pressure and affecting signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes (106307).\nHypolipidemic effects\nIn a hyperlipidemic animal model, chrysanthemum reduced body fat, as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The flavonoids luteolin and luteoloside, found in chrysanthemum, had similar effects. This suggests that they are at least partially responsible for chrysanthemum's hypolipidemic effects. Alteration of lipid metabolism in the liver due to potential antioxidant and lipid enzyme regulatory effects might play a role (106309).\nHypotensive effects\nIn an animal model of renovascular hypertension, chrysanthemum lowered blood pressure (106307).\nOphthalmic effects\nThere is interest in using chrysanthemum for retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration. In vitro research shows that retinal cells treated with chrysanthemum petal extract have lower reactive oxygen species levels when compared with control. Animal research in mice shows that taking chrysanthemum petal extract 0.23-0.38 grams/kg orally daily for 8 weeks reduces markers of light-induced retinal damage, such as proinflammatory cytokines and retinal ganglion cell apoptosis, when compared with control (110510).\nUric acid lowering effects\nA combination of Chrysanthemum indicum flower extract and cassia cinnamon bark extract reduces serum uric acid levels in rats and promotes excretion of uric acid in the urine. The combination also inhibits xanthine oxidase activity, hepatic uric acid production, and cellular uptake of uric acid in vitro. In patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, taking a specific combination of chrysanthemum flower extract and cassia cinnamon bark extract (DKB114, Dongkook Pharm. Co. Ltd.) 4 grams twice daily for 12 weeks reduces serum uric acid by 7.3% from baseline, compared with a 0.26% reduction in those taking placebo (104800).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with chrysin.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhile some evidence shows that chrysin is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract (8168), clinical and in vitro research suggests that chrysin has low systemic bioavailability, which might limit its clinical use (7502, 7504, 7505, 8168, 42931, 42938, 93643). This poor bioavailability may be related to the free hydroxyl groups found on polyphenols like chrysin, which undergo rapid intestinal and hepatic conjugation by glucuronidation and/or sulfation (42903). In one study, the bioavailability of a single oral 400 mg dose of chrysin was estimated to be 0.003-0.02%. Peak plasma concentration occurred at about one hour and was only 3-16 ng/ml, with large inter-individual variability in AUC values of 5-193 ng/ml-h (8168).\n\nSome researchers have enhanced the oral absorption of chrysin by using sodium oleate-based nanoemulsions to inhibit first-pass glucuronidation of chrysin (93639).\nDistribution\nPlasma protein binding of chrysin has been estimated at greater than 99% (8168).\nMetabolism\nChrysin is primarily deactivated by pre-systemic intestinal and hepatic glucuronidation and sulfation (7502, 8168, 42939). Chrysin appears to be metabolized in the intestine and actively pumped back into the lumen, as well as returned to the gastrointestinal tract in the bile (8168). Plasma levels of chrysin glucuronide are higher than levels of chrysin sulfate, suggesting that glucuronidation plays a more important role in the metabolism and elimination of chrysin (93639). Chrysin may increase UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) (7504, 7513, 8170, 42935). As chrysin is also a substrate of UGT1A1, it appears to induce its own elimination (7513, 93641). In the bowel, chrysin conjugates are hydrolyzed back to chrysin (8168).\nExcretion\nFollowing oral administration of a single 400 mg dose of chrysin, 9.8-98% of the dose was ultimately excreted in the feces. The overall recovery in urine was 1-7% of the dose. Notably, only trace amounts of chrysin sulfate is found in urine, compared to 2-26 mg of chrysin glucuronide (8168).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nChrysin is a flavonoid commonly extracted from passion flower (Passiflora incarnata). Chrysin also occurs naturally in other botanicals, including yerba santa, Australian fever tree, eastern white pine, balm of Gilead, black poplar, Baikal skullcap, common skullcap, and genet (Spartium junceum L.), as well as in small amounts in honey and other bee products. Chrysin has also been detected in oak-leaved geranium (Pelargonium quercifolium), other Pelargonium species, and hardy garden mum (Chrysanthemum morifolium) (4001, 7501, 7502, 42892, 93640, 93642, 93643, 93644).\nAnalgesic effects\nIn mouse models of inflammation-induced pain, the effects of chrysin on pain reduction appear to be mediated through spinal opioid receptors and expression of cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element binding (CREB) protein, a protein closely associated with pain transmission. In a formalin-induced pain model, chrysin results in a dose-dependent reduction in pain behaviors in the second phase of pain response and attenuates the upregulation of spinal CREB protein expression when compared with control. In a streptozotocin-induced model of diabetic neuropathy, chrysin reverses reduced pain thresholds in a dose-dependent manner and suppresses upregulation of spinal CREB protein expression when compared with control (106435).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that chrysin may exert anti-inflammatory effects (42899, 42918, 42923, 42925, 42940). Chrysin inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production and metabolic activity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (42923, 42925, 42944).\nAntibacterial effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that chrysin may have antibacterial effects against Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, and Enterobacter aerogenes (42912, 42930, 42940).\nAnticoagulant/antiplatelet effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that chrysin might inhibit platelet aggregation (7502, 42914, 42920, 42952, 93640). Chrysin appears to suppress both \"inside-out\" and \"outside-in\" signal transmissions, and interfering with these signals can impair platelet activation. This may explain chrysin's antiplatelet effects (93640).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nSome preliminary animal research suggests that chrysin might have anticonvulsant effects. In mice, chrysin prevented the expression of tonic-clonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (8167).\nAntifungal effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that chrysin may have antifungal effects against Candida albicans, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis (42930).\nAntineoplastic effects\nResearchers are interested in chrysin for the treatment of cancer due to several potential antineoplastic effects (7503, 7504, 7508, 7513, 8170, 33392, 42901, 42902, 42908, 42913)(42916, 42917, 42921, 42924, 42928, 42936, 42940, 42941, 42943, 42945)(42946, 42947, 42951, 42953, 42954, 42956, 42958, 42963, 42964, 93642). Chrysin seems to increase glucuronidation by inducing UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), which might reduce the bioavailability of dietary carcinogens (7504, 8170). Chrysin might also inhibit cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and 1A2 (CYP1A2), which could prevent activation of potentially carcinogenic food-derived heterocyclic aromatic amines (7503, 8172). There is also preliminary evidence that chrysin might decrease estrogen synthesis by acting as an aromatase (estrogen synthetase) inhibitor, similar to the breast cancer drugs anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole (Femara) (7507, 7508, 42896, 42905, 42911, 42915, 42927, 42938, 42960, 42961, 42962). Other in vitro research shows that chrysin induces apoptosis in human breast cancer cells (93642). Synthesized derivatives of chrysin, diethyl chysin-7-yl phosphate and a tetraethyl bis-phosphoric ester of chrysin, were reported to have the potential to become a new anticancer drug for the treatment of human cervical cancer (42919). Chrysin has also been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of thyroid cancer (42894) and leukemia (42906) in vitro. Chrysin has been shown to possess chemopreventive activity and have a potential role in drug metabolism. Chrysin has also been reported to synergistically enhance the effect of the antineoplastic agent epirubicin in vitro (42928). In a rat study, chrysin increased the bioavailability of the antineoplastic agent, topotecan (42922). Some preliminary in vitro and animal research suggests that adding chrysin to docetaxel therapy might improve the therapeutic efficacy of docetaxel in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (93644).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that chrysin might have antioxidant properties (7509, 42917, 42921, 42929, 42940, 42957). Chrysin appears to inhibit xanthine oxidase, suggesting a potential use for preventing oxidative injury in ischemia-reperfusion and for treating gout (7510).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro research suggests that chrysin might have activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (7512, 8171, 42892, 42898, 42959). It appears to block HIV transcriptional activation, possibly by blocking casein kinase II (CKII), an enzyme that seems to regulate HIV transcription (7512, 8171). Some in vitro research also suggests that chrysin might have moderate antiviral effects against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (42940).\nAnxiolytic effects\nThere is some preliminary animal and in vitro research showing that chrysin can bind benzodiazepine receptors and might have some anxiolytic effects (4001, 8165, 8166, 8167, 42895, 42907, 42950, 42955). Some researchers call chrysin a partial benzodiazepine agonist because it does not seem to affect memory and does not have anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, or sedative activity (4001, 8165, 8166, 8167).\nAthletic performance/bodybuilding effects\nAthletes are interested in chrysin for bodybuilding due to its potential effect on testosterone levels. In vitro research shows that chrysin might inhibit aromatase and decrease aromatization of androstenedione and testosterone to estrogen and dihydrotestosterone (7506); however, research in humans shows that chrysin alone or in combination with androgen precursors such as androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has mixed effects on free and total testosterone levels (7514, 8138, 42910). One of these studies showed that taking chrysin along with androgen precursors increases free testosterone levels but does not inhibit the conversion of androstenedione to estrogen and dihydrotestosterone (8138).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn vitro research suggests that chrysin may exert vasorelaxant effects and lower blood pressure, potentially reducing atherosclerosis by inhibiting the expression of cellular adhesion molecules (42920, 42948). Epidemiologic research seeking an association of flavonoid intake with the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) has yielded mixed results, with some studies reporting cardioprotective effects and an inverse relationship between flavonoids and CHD (8119, 42904, 7726), while other studies have not found such an association (36563, 42909). Currently there is a lack of information regarding the use of chrysin alone for cardiovascular disease.\nCollagen effects\nPreliminary in vitro research suggests that chrysin has potential as a starting material for pharmaceutical preparations targeted against various disorders involving abnormal collagen metabolism. Chrysin was found to increase collagen concentration without changing the overall protein concentration (42942).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn a clinical study, researchers proposed that chrysin might reduce irinotecan (CPT-11)-induced diarrhea by shifting the equilibrium of its active metabolite (SN-38) towards the inactive form in the gastrointestinal mucosa (42934).\nHormonal effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that chrysin displays antiestrogen activity (7506, 7507, 42905, 42960, 42962). Some research suggests that this activity is due to chrysin's ability to inhibit aromatase, an enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen (7507, 7506). This has lead researchers to hypothesize that chrysin may be beneficial for women suffering from endometriosis (42937). In vitro research suggests that chrysin lacks inhibitory effects on catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that converts the catechol estrogens to their inactive methoxy derivatives, suggesting that this mechanism is not responsible for chrysin's antiestrogen activity (42915).\nImmune effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that chrysin displays an immunosuppressive effect greater than cyclosporine A (42900). Additional in vitro research suggests that chrysin might reduce immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic response (42926).\nMuscle relaxant effects\nAnimal and in vitro research provides conflicting evidence as to whether chrysin has muscle relaxant effects (4001, 8165, 8167, 42895, 42907, 42950, 42955).\nPhotoprotective effects\nSome animal research suggests that animals fed a combination of chrysin, quercetin, and a green tea phenol extract are protected from contact hypersensitivity induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation (7511). Currently, there is a lack of information regarding the use of chrysin alone for photoprotection. Additionally, the mechanism of this effect is unclear.\nWeight effects\nChrysin is proposed to exert its anti-obesity effects through inhibition of pancreatic lipase, reduced caloric intake, and increased energy expenditure. In vitro research suggests that chrysin competitively inhibits pancreatic lipase with good affinity. In non-obese rats, chrysin decreases serum triglycerides, acute feed intake, and preference for sucrose. In obese rats, medium and high doses of chrysin improve anthropometric parameters, increase fecal cholesterol and locomotor activity, and reduce caloric intake, adiposity index, and hypertrophy and inflammation of adipocytes (106434)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCilantro contains carotenoids and carotenoid derivatives such as beta-carotene (31086, 68206, 90467), lutein (68206), and beta-ionone (26556); elements such as iron (90467) and calcium (26559); insoluble oxalate (49700); the furoisocoumarin coriandrin (4-methoxy-7-methyl-5H-furo(2,3-g)benzopyran-5-one) (46228); alkanals and alkenals such as (E)-2-dodecenal, (E)-2-tridecenal, decanal, (E)- and (Z)-2-decenal, and dodecenal (26300, 26553, 26556, 46201); alcohols such as linalool (26553), eugenol (26556, 46201), E-2-dodecen-1-ol (26556), and 1-dodecanol; sesquiterpenes such as gamma-cadinene (46201); acids such as caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, and chlorogenic acid (49650); (Z)-myroxide (46201), neryl acetate (46201).\nAntibacterial effects\nEvidence from in vitro research suggests that the antibacterial activity of essential oil of cilantro against Listeria monocytogenes is due to the presence of long chain (C6-C10) alcohol and aldehyde constituents (47762). Other in vitro evidence suggests that (2E)-alkenal and alkanal constituents of cilantro have antibacterial activity against Salmonella choleraesuis due to their nonionic surfactant properties (12031).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animal research, cilantro extract had antihyperglycemic effects, possibly related to inhibition of alpha-glucosidase by its rutin constituent (97873).\nAntimutagenic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that crude juice from cilantro and other coriander plant parts significantly decreases the mutagenicity of metabolized aromatic amines without causing toxicity; this antimutagenic activity was associated with the chlorophyll content of the cilantro juice (26296).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that cilantro extracts are potent inhibitors of lipid peroxide formation and scavengers of oxygen radicals (49415, 97872). Cilantro seems to have more free radical scavenging activity than coriander seeds (49650). Evidence from animal research suggests that cilantro extract protects the liver from oxidative stress induced by carbon tetrachloride. Pretreatment of rats with cilantro extract lowers levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances(TBARS) levels and increases the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (46220).\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn vitro research suggests that cilantro extracts have larvidical activity against certain mosquito species, including Aedes fluviatilis and Aedes aegypti (46180, 46231).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro research suggests that aqueous extracts of cilantro can inhibit human platelet aggregation (26583).\nChelation effects\nCilantro has been reported to remove mercury, lead, and aluminum from body tissues by accelerating their urinary excretion (26563, 68266). Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that removing metals such as mercury may improve the effectiveness of some antiviral and antibacterial therapies, which are believed to be inhibited by heavy metal deposits that co-exist with certain bacterial or viral infections (68266). Also, preliminary clinical research suggests that cilantro may prevent the absorption of mercury contained in amalgam dental fillings (26596). There is also preliminary clinical evidence that cilantro can reduce asbestos levels in asbestos-induced tumors better than DHEA or (+) qi gong energy-stored paper (26562). Preliminary animal research suggests that administration of cilantro might decrease localized lead deposition in the femur and kidneys as well as renal tissue damage (26597). Additional animal research has shown that the cilantro has suppressive activity on lead deposition, possibly resulting from the chelation of lead by some plant constituents (46163).\nPhotosensitizing effects\nIn vitro research suggests that coriandrin, a component of cilantro, has photosensitizing effects in mammalian cells, although the effects are not as strong as psoralen (46228).\nUltraviolet (UV) protective effects\nIn animal research, cilantro extract protected against UV-induced photoaging by reducing the production of oxygen free radicals (97872)."

The US Code of Federal Regulations allows not more than 83 parts per million (ppm) of total cinchona alkaloids in finished beverages (93229).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in medicinal amounts. Cinchona derivatives marketed as over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are required to carry the warning, \"Caution - discontinue use if ringing in the ears, deafness, skin rash, or visual disturbances occur\" (93231). Cinchona contains the alkaloid quinine that was previously available OTC in the US for treatment and prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. In 1994 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that quinine was not generally recognized as safe and effective for this indication, citing serious adverse reactions and its narrow therapeutic index (93232, 93233). A final ban on marketing of OTC quinine products was implemented by the FDA in 2007, and a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to reduce off-label use of prescription quinine products for night-time leg cramps was introduced in 2010 (93232).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when excessive amounts are used orally. Cinchona contains the alkaloids quinine and quinidine, which are used as prescription medicines and have been associated with significant adverse effects at doses of 2 grams per day or more (505). The amount of these constituents in cinchona products is variable (13).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally. Cinchona is reported to have uterine stimulant and abortifacient activity, and to be fetotoxic and teratogenic, causing visual and auditory defects (12, 19).

Cinchona bark also contains indole alkaloids, cinchophyllines, triterpenes including chinovic acid-3-O-chinovoside and chinovic acid-3-O-glucoside, and catechin tannins (18, 93230).\nAntimalarial effects\nCinchona was traditionally used in the treatment of malaria and is the original source of the antimalarial drug quinine (93223). Quinine acts primarily against asexual forms of the malaria parasite in erythrocytes, and is thought to interfere with detoxification of heme ingested by the parasite (505). There is also preliminary evidence that a combination of the alkaloids quinine, quinidine, and cinchonine from cinchona bark has activity against quinine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro (93227).\nAntiplatelet effects\nThere is in vitro evidence that cinchonine inhibits platelet aggregation mediated by epinephrine, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), platelet activating factor, and collagen. The mechanism is thought to involve inhibition of calcium influx (93228).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe alkaloid quinidine present in cinchona inhibits cardiac sodium and potassium channels, leading to antiarrhythmic effects and an increase in the duration of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram. It also blocks alpha adrenergic receptors and can cause hypotension (505)."

Another small clinical trial in patients with distal radius fractures shows that taking the same Ayurvedic preparation orally, 3-4 grams twice daily for 6 weeks, with or without a topical preparation of Cissus quadrangularis, 15 grams applied once daily for 2 weeks, seems to decrease subjective measures of pain and swelling when compared to baseline (95922).

Small clinical studies suggest that oral or topical Cissus quadrangularis extracts may not improve symptoms of hemorrhoids.\nSeveral small clinical studies in patients with acute, symptomatic hemorrhoids show that taking Cissus quadrangularis extract as either 100 mg daily for 1 week, 180 mg daily for 2 weeks, or 1 gram three times daily for 3 days followed by 1 gram twice daily for 4 days, does not improve symptoms of hemorrhoids when compared with placebo (43204, 95921). Using a topical preparation of Cissus quadrangularis extract three times daily for 1 week also seems to be no better than placebo (95921). Another small clinical study in this population shows that rectal administration of a suppository containing Cissus quadrangularis extract 1% and Amcella paniculata extract 1% twice daily for 7 days results in similar improvements in anal pain, bleeding, and prolapse size when compared with a commercial suppository containing hydrocortisone 5 mg and cinchocaine 5 mg (108548). It is unclear if these findings are due to Cissus quadrangularis, Amcella paniculate, or the combination.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral Cissus quadrangularis for hyperlipidemia there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Cissus quadrangularis for this purpose.\nJoint pain. It is unclear if oral Cissus quadrangularis is beneficial in patients with joint pain.\nA small clinical study in males with exercise-related chronic joint pain shows that taking two 800 mg capsules of a specific Cissus quadrangularis product (SuperCissus, USPlabs) twice daily for 8 weeks decreases pain by 31% and stiffness by 23% when compared to baseline (93633). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral Cissus quadrangularis for metabolic syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Cissus quadrangularis for this purpose.\nMuscle strength. Although there has been interest in using oral Cissus quadrangularis to improve muscle strength, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Cissus quadrangularis for this purpose.\nOsteopenia. It is unclear if oral Cissus quadrangularis is beneficial for osteopenia.\nA moderate-sized clinical trial in Thailand among postmenopausal patients with osteopenia shows that taking Cissus quadrangularis 1200 or 1600 mg daily for 24 weeks does not improve bone mineral density (BMD) when compared with placebo. However, Cissus quadrangularis does seem to improve markers of bone turnover, suggesting that longer-term use might lead to improvements in BMD (112140). Also, a small clinical study in patients with low BMD shows that taking a combination of Cissus quadrangularis, ashwagandha, and holy basil once daily for 6 months seems to improve BMD, T-score, and Z-score when compared with placebo (43217). However, it is unclear if these findings are due to Cissus quadrangularis, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOsteoporosis.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Cissus quadrangularis are the whole plant, leaf, stem, or root. The major components of Cissus quadrangularis are flavonoids; ketosteroids (15610); lipids; stilbenes such as pallidol (15612, 15615), quadrangularin A (15612, 15615), resveratrol (15612, 15615), piceatannol (15612, 15615) and perthenocissin (15612, 15615); and triterpenoids (15609, 43187) such as epifriedelinol (43204), isoarborenol (43204), and lupenone (43204). Other constituents include 3,3',4,4'-tetrahydroxybiphenyl (43176); cysteine proteases (43189); alpha-amyrin (15610), beta-amyrin (15610), and delta-amyrin (43176); delta-amyrone (43176); indanes (16457); iridoids such as picroside-1 (15612, 15615), 6-O-[2,3-dimethoxy]-trans-cinnamoyl catalpol (15612, 15615, 43198), and 6-O-meta-methoxy-benzoyl catalpol (15612, 15615); onocer-7-ene-3alpha,21beta-diol (43176); phytosterols such as beta-sitosterol (15610, 15615) and beta-sitosterol glycoside (15615); polyphenols (43197); quercetin (15610, 15615); quercetrin (15610, 15615); and tannins (43178). Additionally, various vitamins and minerals have also been reported, including ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (15608, 15609, 15610, 43178, 43187, 43192, 43197), carotenoids (15609, 43187) such as carotene (15608, 15610), calcium (15608), and vitamin E (43197).\nAnalgesic effects\nSome animal research shows that Cissus quadrangularis has both central and peripheral analgesic activity. The analgesic effects were reportedly comparable to that of aspirin (15612, 43207, 43209).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal and in vitro research suggests that Cissus quadrangularis and its constituents, such as ascorbic acid, have anti-inflammatory effects, as evidenced by inhibitory effects on arachidonic acid metabolism (15612) and nitric oxide production in various experimental models (43188, 43192, 43201, 43208). In macrophages, the ethyl acetate extract of Cissus quadrangularis stem induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner (43201).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of both fresh and dry stems of Cissus quadrangularis display antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus species (43178). In other experimental research, the alcohol extracts exerted antimicrobial activity against the plant pathogens Aspergillus niger, Xanthomonas campestris, and Pseudomonas fulva (43210). Additionally, in vitro research shows that an extract of Cissus quadrangularis has activity against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro, suggesting possible antimalarial activity (15613).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn vitro research shows that the methanol extract from the root of Cissus quadrangularis has antiproliferative activity in liver cancer cells (43175).\nAntioxidant effects\nExtracts of Cissus quadrangularis appear to have antioxidant effects, possibly due to vitamin C, quercetin, and beta-carotene constituents (15610). These effects have been demonstrated in animal and in vitro research and may explain the mechanism for Cissus quadrangularis' hepatoprotective and gastroprotective effects (15609, 43178, 43188, 43197, 43202, 43211).\nAntispasmodic effects\nPreliminary animal research shows that Cissus quadrangularis extract relaxes smooth muscle in rats, suggesting antispasmodic activity (43207).\nBone effects\nSome animal research shows that Cissus quadrangularis stimulates bone growth (43194); promotes osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization (43193, 43196, 43198, 43203); increases bone thickness (43199); and decreases osteoclast activity (43185, 43199). Some in vitro research suggests that the osteogenic activity of Cissus quadrangularis is moderated by a MAPK-dependent mechanism (43193). Additionally, in human osteoblasts, the ethanolic extract of Cissus quadrangularis increased mRNA and protein expression of the Runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), a transcription factor that is involved in bone development (43203). The antiosteoporotic activity of Cissus quadrangularis is purportedly comparable to that of raloxifene, a known antiosteoporotic agent (43185, 43199).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research shows that Cissus quadrangularis extracts stimulate gastric cell proliferation and increase synthesis and secretion of gastric mucus. These extracts also seem to decrease the development of gastric lesions in aspirin-treated animals (15610, 15611, 43186). Decreased markers of inflammation, reduced lipid peroxidation, and increased antioxidants such as glutathione were also reported in response to these extracts. Cissus quadrangularis extracts also decrease oxidative damage of DNA. These properties are thought to contribute to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related damage to the gastric mucosa and protection against peptic ulcers (15610). In animal and laboratory research, Cissus quadrangularis demonstrated antioxidant effects, which may be the underlying mechanism for its gastroprotective effects (15610, 43187, 43188, 43211). In rats, the administration of Cissus quadrangularis extract dose-dependently reduced the size of acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer via enhanced cell proliferation and cytoprotection (43200). It has been found to have similar or better antiulcer effects than certain antiulcer drugs, including ranitidine and sucralfate (43212, 43186).\nHemorrhoid effects\nSome animal research shows that extracts of Cissus quadrangularis have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and venotonic effects (15612). These pharmacological properties suggest possible benefit for reducing pain and inflammation and reducing the size of hemorrhoids. However, neither oral nor topical Cissus quadrangularis products have shown benefit for hemorrhoids in small clinical studies (43204, 95921).\nHepatoprotective effects\nAnimal and in vitro research suggest that Cissus quadrangularis demonstrates antioxidant effects, which may be the underlying mechanism for its hepatoprotective effects (43178, 43197, 43202). The methanol extract of Cissus quadrangularis decreased elevated levels of liver enzymes and bilirubin in isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity in rats (43202). These effects were accompanied by a decrease in lipid peroxidation and an increase in antioxidant enzymes (i.e., stimulation of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activity).\nWeight loss effects\nConstituents of Cissus quadrangularis are reported to inhibit lipase and amylase, reducing breakdown and absorption of dietary fats and carbohydrates, which could contribute to weight-loss (16457). An increase in plasma serotonin (5-HT) and creatinine levels suggests that appetite control and lean muscle mass promotion may also contribute to the plant's weight loss effects (15609)."

The lethal dose (LD50) for Cistanche deserticola tea in an acute study was more than 60 grams/kg (93870). Furthermore, in a 90-day feeding study, the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was over 12 grams/kg (93870). Genetic toxicity was lacking (93870). Toxicity associated with powdered Cistanche deserticola was also lacking, with a 90-day NOAEL of 7.8 grams/kg for males and 8 grams/kg for females (93871).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animal research, oral intake of Cistanche deserticola increased plasma levels of various constituents, including phenylethanoid glycosides and their metabolites (93872).\nMetabolism\nIn animal research, the phenylethanoid glycosides were metabolized via phase I or phase II metabolic reactions after oral intake of Cistanche deserticola (93872).\nExcretion\nIn animal research, oral intake of Cistanche deserticola increased levels of various constituents and their metabolites in the urine (93872).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Cistanche deserticola is the stem. Constituents of the stem include oligosaccharides and phenylethanoid glycosides, such as echinacoside and acteoside. These are thought to be the major active constituents (93870, 100993). An ethanolic extract of Cistanche deserticola was found to contain oligosacchardies (78.7%), acteoside (9.3%), echinacoside (6.3%), and 8-epiloganic acid (5.8%), the latter of which is an iridoid constituent (100993). The stem also contains lignans, polysaccharides, liriodendrin, betaine, phytosterols, mannitol, succinic acid, and syringin (93870).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe anti-inflammatory effects of Cistanche deserticola and its constituents may play a role in some of the pharmacological effects of the plant. An extract of Cistanche deserticola, composed primarily of oligosaccharides and phenylethanoid glycosides, has been shown to decrease the expression of numerous inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2, and interleukin-6, in rats with spinal cord injuries (100993).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of Cistanche deserticola and its constituents may play a role in some of the pharmacological effects of the plant. The constituents most likely to have antioxidant effects are the phenylethanoid glycosides and oligosaccharides. Studies have included animal and laboratory research (93870, 100993).\nBone effects\nLaboratory research suggests that Cistanche deserticola might benefit bone health. A total phenylethanoid glycoside fraction extracted from Cistanche deserticola has been shown to improve bone mineral density, increase serum calcium levels, upregulate markers of bone formation, and downregulate markers of bone resorption in an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. This fraction also reduced levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL), and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), suggesting that the beneficial effects on bone health may be related to the suppression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and stimulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathways upon suppression of RANK/RANKL/TRAF6 signaling (100994). In vitro research has also found that Cistanche deserticola extract promotes bone formation, possibly by stimulating the genes involved in bone mineralization or guiding the bone mesenchymal stem cells in differentiating osteoblasts (93870).\nExercise effects\nIn animal research, Cistanche deserticola extract reduces fatigue and muscle damage. This suggests that Cistanche deserticola might improve exercise endurance by more than one mechanism (93870).\nHepatoprotective effects\nCistanche deserticola might benefit liver health. Some of the phenylethanoid glycoside constituents have been shown to have antioxidant effects in liver cells in animal and in vitro models. These antioxidant effects might improve liver function and protect liver cells from apoptosis (93870).\nImmune effects\nCistanche deserticola is thought to have effects on the immune system, although studies in humans are lacking. In immunosuppressed mice, isolated polysaccharides from the plant have been shown to increase the immune response and phagocytosis. It is possible that the androgen-like effects of Cistanche deserticola contribute to the immunomodulatory effects (93870).\nIntestinal effects\nCistanche deserticola is traditionally used for constipation. In animal research, the extract inhibits absorption of fluid in the intestines and possibly promotes intestinal propulsion. Echinacoside, a constituent of Cistanche deserticola, has possible anti-inflammatory effects, improving the repair of damaged intestinal mucosal tissue (93870).\nNeuroprotective effects\nLaboratory research suggests that Cistanche deserticola has neuroprotective effects and might be useful for preventing or delaying the progression of Parkinson disease or limiting the development of spinal cord dysfunction after a spinal cord injury. These effects are possibly related to a decreased expression of genes involved in cell growth arrest and apoptosis. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cell protective effects of Cistanche deserticola, as well as effects on nerve growth factor production and activity, might also contribute to its neuroprotective activity (93870, 100993).\nSexual function effects\nIn traditional medicine, Cistanche deserticola is used to improve symptoms of erectile dysfunction and to induce male sexual activity. It is thought that it increases testosterone production and improves semen quality. A combination of Cistanche deserticola and horny goat weed increased testosterone levels in older men with lower hormone levels. In animal research, Cistanche deserticola increased prostate and testicle weights (93870)."

Clinical research in elderly patients shows that taking oral or intravenous citicoline daily improves some memory scores, short-term.\nSeveral small clinical studies in people 50-85 years of age with age-related cognitive decline shows that taking citicoline 500-2000 mg daily, either orally or by intravenous infusion, for up to 12 weeks moderately improves memory scores when compared with placebo (12130, 12131, 43284, 109016). Citicoline consistently improves short-term recall and verbal memory, but the effects on other domains are less clear (12130, 12131, 43284). In one clinical study, a specific citicoline product (Cognizin, Kyowa Hakko) 500 mg daily for 12 weeks was used (109016).\nless\nGlaucoma. Clinical research shows that oral, intramuscular, or ophthalmic citicoline may improve vision or slow the rate of vision loss in patients with glaucoma. However, these different routes of administration have not been directly compared.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with open-angle glaucoma shows that taking citicoline 1600 mg orally daily for 60 days improves visual evoked potentials, but not intraocular pressure (IOP), when compared with baseline (43256). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with rapidly progressing glaucoma shows that taking a specific citicoline product (Neukron Ofta, Omikron), 500 mg orally daily for 4 four-month cycles over the course of 2 years, reduces the rate of visual field loss when compared with baseline (98448). The validity of both of these studies is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Small clinical studies in adults with open-angle glaucoma also show that treatment with intramuscular citicoline 1000 mg daily for 60 days improves visual evoked potentials, but not IOP, when compared with placebo or baseline (12173, 43219, 43256). Also, one clinical study shows that using a specific citicoline 2% eye drop (OMK1, Omicron) three times a day for 3 years reduces the loss of retinal nerve fibers and decreases visual field progression rates in patients with open-angle glaucoma and controlled IOP when compared with placebo (104827).\n\nCiticoline has also been used as part of a combination product. Preliminary clinical research in adults with primary open-angle glaucoma and controlled IOP shows that taking citicoline 500 mg, homotaurine 50 mg, and vitamin E 12 mg orally once daily for 4 months improves visual contrast sensitivity scores by less than 10% and self-reported quality of life scores by about 10% when compared with no additional interventions (104786). It is unclear if these effects are clinically relevant or if they are due to citicoline, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nStroke. Oral or intravenous citicoline, started within 12-24 hours of onset of ischemic stroke symptoms, does not seem to improve outcomes in most patients. However, it may be modestly beneficial in those who are not candidates for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA).\nA meta-analysis of 10 trials shows that treatment with oral or intravenous citicoline 500-2000 mg daily for up to 6 weeks after ischemic stroke does not improve mortality, ability to complete activities of daily living, or neurologic function when compared with placebo or no intervention (104828). A different meta-analysis of 10 trials shows that treatment with oral or intravenous citicoline 250-2000 mg daily for up to 6 weeks after ischemic stroke increases the odds of recovery to independence by 56% and decreases the mortality rate and long-term disability by 10-12% when compared with placebo. However, this second meta-analysis included older, lower-quality trials in which the standard of care with conventional medicines was lower and ischemic stroke diagnoses were not confirmed via imaging (98228). Higher-quality trials have not confirmed these benefits, especially when patients receive early treatment with rtPA (98228, 104828). A third meta-analysis of 7 trials with more limited inclusion criteria also did not demonstrate benefit on mortality or functional independence when compared with control (98447). Also, a large clinical trial of patients with moderate to severe acute ischemic stroke who received standard of care stroke management, including rtPA when indicated, shows that citicoline 1000 mg, administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes every 12 hours for 3 days and started within 24 hours of symptom onset, does not increase the rate of recovery at 90 days when compared with placebo (98444).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral citicoline is beneficial in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with Alzheimer disease shows that taking citicoline 1000 mg orally daily for 12 weeks modestly improves cognitive function scores when compared with placebo (43222). Observational research in adults with Alzheimer disease has also found that taking citicoline 1000 mg orally in conjunction with memantine and rivastigmine for up to 12 months is associated with clinically non-significant improvements in cognitive function scores when compared with memantine and rivastigmine alone. In addition, taking citicoline was not associated with improvement in depression scores or activities of daily living (105730).\nless\nAmblyopia. It is unclear if oral or intramuscular citicoline is beneficial in patients with amblyopia.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with amblyopia shows that taking citicoline orally once daily, in combination with covering the affected eye with a patch, for 12 months moderately improves visual acuity when compared with the patch alone. Children aged less than 5 years took 250 mg daily and children aged 5-13 years took 500 mg daily (98442). Retrospective research in children aged 5-6 years with amblyopia has also found that citicoline treatment for up to 8 months is associated with modest improvements in visual acuity when compared with baseline. However, preliminary subgroup analyses suggest that benefits may not last longer than 3-4 months (109017).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in older patients with amblyopia, aged 9-37 years, shows that treatment with intramuscular citicoline 1000 mg daily for 15 days improves visual acuity in both eyes for 92% of patients when compared with baseline (43281).

It is unclear if oral citicoline is beneficial in patients with bipolar disorder.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence shows that taking citicoline orally for 12 weeks improves verbal learning scores, but not symptoms of depression or mania, when compared with placebo. Citicoline was titrated from 500 mg daily to 2000 mg daily over the first 6 weeks and then continued at 2000 mg daily for 6 weeks (43248).\nless\nCardiac arrest. It is unclear if intravenous citicoline can improve outcomes in children with cardiac arrest.\nA small clinical study in children 1-12 years of age with successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest shows that using citicoline 10 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours for 6 weeks improves disability and coma scores at 12 weeks when compared with no intervention. This study also suggests that using citicoline reduces mortality by 80% and duration of hospitalization by 12% when compared with no intervention (105729). However, the small size of this study limits the reliability of these findings.\nless\nCerebrovascular disease. It is unclear if oral, intramuscular, or intravenous citicoline is beneficial in patients with cerebrovascular disease.\nSeveral small clinical trials in adults with chronic cerebrovascular disease shows that treatment with citicoline 600-1000 mg orally daily for up to 12 months or 600-1000 mg intramuscularly or intravenously daily for up to 12 weeks moderately improves memory and behavior scores when compared with placebo or no intervention (12131, 43240, 43288, 98443). One of these clinical trials failed to show improvement in activities of daily living, although the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (98443).\nless\nCocaine dependence. It is unclear if oral citicoline is beneficial in patients with cocaine dependence.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with cocaine dependence and bipolar disorder shows that taking citicoline orally for 12 weeks reduces the likelihood of positive urine cocaine test results when compared with placebo. Citicoline was titrated from 500 mg daily to 2000 mg daily over the first 6 weeks and then continued at 2000 mg daily for 6 weeks (43248). However, a post-hoc analysis suggests that the effects of citicoline on abstaining from cocaine use decline over time and were no different than placebo in the last weeks of the study (98230). In addition, other clinical research in adults with cocaine dependence that also received weekly counseling shows that taking citicoline 500 mg orally twice daily for 8 weeks does not reduce cocaine craving or consumption levels when compared with placebo (98445).\nless\nDelirium. Although there has been interest in using oral citicoline for delirium, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of citicoline for this purpose.\nDepression. It is unclear if oral citicoline is beneficial in patients with depression.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with major depressive disorder shows that adding citicoline 100 mg orally twice daily for 6 weeks to citalopram therapy improves symptoms of depression, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and increases the relative rate of remission by 64% when compared with placebo. These results suggest that for every 4 patients treated with citicoline, remission is expected in one additional patient (98446).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. Citicoline eye drops have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; the effect of citicoline when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild diabetic retinopathy shows that using a specific ophthalmic solution containing citicoline 2% and cyanocobalamin 0.05% (OMK2, Omikron Italia) three times a day for 3 years decreases visual field progression rates and stabilizes retinal nerve fiber thickness when compared with placebo (104825).\nless\nIntracranial hemorrhage. It is unclear if intravenous citicoline is beneficial in patients with intracranial hemorrhage.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage shows that using citicoline 250 mg intravenously twice daily for 14 days improves muscular strength by 25% when compared with placebo (43252).\nless\nIschemic optic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral citicoline is beneficial in patients with ischemic optic neuropathy.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy shows that taking a specific type of citicoline (Cebrolux-Tubilux) 1600 mg orally daily for 60 days improves visual acuity and visual evoked potentials when compared with no intervention (43250).\nless\nMethamphetamine use disorder. It is unclear if oral citicoline is beneficial in patients with methamphetamine use disorder.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with methamphetamine dependence shows that taking citicoline 1000 mg orally twice daily for 8 weeks reduces the severity of cravings when compared with baseline, but not when compared with placebo. Taking citicoline also did not reduce the number of methamphetamine positive urine samples when compared with placebo (109015). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral or intramuscular citicoline is beneficial in patients with Parkinson disease.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking citicoline 1200 mg orally daily for one month improves Parkinson disease symptom scores when compared with no intervention (43259). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with Parkinson disease shows that treatment with citicoline 500 mg orally daily or citicoline 500-1000 mg intramuscularly daily for 30 days improves rigidity and bradykinesia scores, but not tremor scores, when compared with baseline (43253, 43262). The validity of these studies is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral citicoline is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with chronic, stable schizophrenia shows that taking citicoline 1250 mg twice daily for 8 weeks as an add-on to risperidone therapy modestly reduces negative symptoms, but not positive symptoms, of schizophrenia when compared with placebo plus risperidone (100988). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with chronic, stable schizophrenia shows that taking citicoline 500 mg, 1000 mg, or 2000 mg as a single dose does not improve sensory gating when compared with placebo (100987). However, both studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear if oral citicoline is beneficial in patients with TBI; the available research is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of 5 low-quality studies in patients with TBI shows that treatment with oral or intravenous citicoline up to 2000 mg daily for up to 9 days does not improve Glasgow outcome scores or cognitive performance. Additionally, one study included in this analysis showed no improvement in survival with citicoline when compared with placebo (98227). However, a very small clinical study not included in this analysis shows that taking citicoline 1000 mg orally daily improves memory, learning, and verbal ability in patients with TBI (43287).\n\nSome observational research has found that continuous intravenous infusion of citicoline 3000 mg over 24 hours for up to 21 days is associated with 6.7-fold greater odds of survival while in the intensive care unit (ICU) when compared with matched controls not receiving citicoline. Citicoline therapy was also linked to 2.6-fold greater odds of having a favorable outcome after 6 months, defined as a score of 5-8 on the extended version of the Glasgow Outcome Scale (100989). The discrepant results may be explained by differences in the severity of TBI at baseline and the doses of citicoline used in these studies.\nless\nVascular dementia. It is unclear if oral citicoline is beneficial in patients with vascular dementia.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with vascular dementia shows that taking citicoline 500 mg orally twice daily for 12 months does not improve neuropsychological symptom scores when compared with placebo (12135).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate citicoline for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCiticoline is readily absorbed when taken orally (43246, 43270). Animal studies show that it is relatively stable in the stomach; however, it is quickly degraded into choline and cytidine in the intestine (43260).\nDistribution\nCiticoline has a biphasic peak. The first peak occurs at 1 hour after administration, followed by a higher peak 24-hours post-dose (43270).\nExcretion\nCiticoline is primarily eliminated through the kidneys. The half-life of citicoline is 71 hours (12132). Less than 1% is excreted unchanged in the feces (43246, 43270). Some citicoline is also eliminated through respiratory carbon dioxide (43270).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCiticoline is formed endogenously as an intermediate in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from choline (12129, 12140). When taken orally, citicoline is metabolized in the gut to cytidine and choline which are absorbed independently and taken up by brain cells. Within the brain cells cytidine is converted to cytidine monophosphate, cytidine diphosphate, and cytidine triphosphate. Choline is phosphorylated to form phosphocholine, which combines with cytidine triphosphate to reform citicoline. Citicoline then rapidly combines with diacylglycerol to form the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine, which activates biosynthesis of structural phospholipids in neuronal membranes, improving brain metabolism and neuronal repair (12128, 12140, 12195, 98442). In rats, citicoline treatment increases dendritic length and branch points, increasing the surface area occupied by neurons and increasing efficiency of sensory information processing (98442). In animal models, orally administered citicoline increases brain phosphatidylcholine levels by 23% after 42 days and 30% after 90 days. In humans, a single dose of citicoline increases brain choline levels by about 18% in younger adults. But in older adults, brain choline levels do not seem to increase significantly. It is thought that choline uptake in the brain decreases with age, but cytidine uptake does not decrease (12129). Citicoline also provides precursors for synthesis of neurotransmitters in the brain, including acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin (98442, 98446).\nAnti-addiction effects\nThere is interest in using citicoline for substance use disorders, including cocaine and methamphetamine dependence. Long-term cocaine use is associated with cerebral perfusion deficits. Citicoline is hypothesized to exert a therapeutic effect by reversing neuronal damage and enhancing neurotransmitter concentrations (98445). Preliminary clinical research in adults with methamphetamine dependence shows that increased gray matter volume in the left middle frontal gyrus is associated with lower craving severity scores. This same study shows that taking citicoline 1000 mg orally twice daily for 8 weeks increases left middle frontal gyrus gray matter volume when compared with placebo (109015).\nAnti-ischemic effects\nIn animal models of ischemic stroke, citicoline seems to help reduce neuronal damage, possibly by decreasing neuronal apoptosis (12138). As a precursor for structural phospholipids in neuronal membranes in the brain, citicoline may help to reverse the ischemia-induced decrease in brain phosphatidylcholine which contributes to neuronal damage (12128, 12140, 12195, 43276, 98442). Administration of citicoline to patients with acute ischemic stroke resulted in less increase in ischemic lesion volume, as seen on MRI, compared with placebo (43225).\nAnti-Parkinson effects\nCiticoline increases dopamine levels in the brain and also improves dopaminergic cell survival, which is reduced in people with Parkinson disease (12132, 12133, 12140). Citicoline also increases survival of dopaminergic neurons exposed to toxins in animals (43309). It also increases levels of the antioxidant reduced glutathione which are decreased in the substantia nigra of people with Parkinson disease (12133, 12140).\nAntiaging effects\nCiticoline is a precursor for structural phospholipids in neuronal membranes in the brain, which might attenuate age-related changes in the brain (43234). It may also reverse decreases in acetylcholine and cholinergic neurons seen with aging (12129).\nAntidepressant effects\nCiticoline may work as an antidepressant by increasing neurotransmitter levels in the brain, including acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin (98446). Citicoline has been shown to increase norepinephrine levels in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, increase dopamine levels in the striatum, and increase serotonin levels in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus (43257).\nAntipsychotic effects\nAssociations between schizophrenia and diminished expression of alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha-7 nAChRs) have been reported. Citicoline is thought to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, specifically the negative symptoms, through agonism of alpha-7 nAChRs. Citicoline has also been shown to increase norepinephrine and dopamine levels, decrease glutamate activity in certain areas of the brain, and exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, all of which may also contribute to its proposed effects in patients with schizophrenia (100988).\nBrain injury effects\nBrain trauma can result in cerebral ischemia and degradation of phosphatidylcholine to free radicals and free fatty acids. Citicoline is thought to decrease generation of reactive oxygen species, and stabilize cell membranes (12134, 12194, 12195). In animal models of brain trauma citicoline reduces neuronal death, reduces cortical contusion volume, and improves neurological recovery (12137). Citicoline may also have beneficial effects by increasing brain acetylcholine (12129, 12130, 12195).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn animal models of hemorrhagic shock, intravenous administration of citicoline reverses hypotension. In normotensive rats, intravenous administration of citicoline increases blood pressure (12136). It is not known if therapeutic doses of citicoline affect blood pressure in humans.\nOphthalmic effects\nThere is interest in using citicoline to protect ocular nerves. The transformation of citicoline to cytidine monophosphate and phospholipids may help restore cell membrane damage and protect nerves (104824, 104826). Citicoline provides precursors for neurotransmitter synthesis and increases retinal dopamine and epinephrine levels in rabbits (98442).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that use of a specific citicoline 2% and cyanocobalamin 0.05% ophthalmic solution (OMK2, Omikron Italia) for 18 months after argon laser photocoagulation procedures improves corneal sensitivity and corneal nerve fiber length density when compared with placebo (104826). Another clinical trial shows that using a specific citicoline 2% ophthalmic solution (OMK1, Omikron Italia) for 1 month after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) procedures improves the rate of corneal sensitivity recovery when compared with sodium hyaluronate 1.5% ophthalmic solution (104824)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCitric acid is a type of alpha hydroxy acid. Alpha hydroxy acids are a group of natural acids found in foods. For example, citric acid is found in apple cider vinegar, as well as lemon, lime, and other citrus fruits (13183, 15170, 15214, 108186). In lemons and limes, citric acid makes up as much as 8% of the dry fruit weight (108186).\nCough effects\nNebulized citric acid is used to induce cough. Possible mechanisms of action for its tussive response include the TRPV1 receptor, the acid sensing ion channels (ASIC), and the TRPA1 receptor (108196).\nDermatological effects\nHyperkeratinization is thought to contribute to acne, dry skin, and photo-aging. Alpha hydroxy acids such as citric acid work by exfoliating the top layers of dead skin cells (948, 950, 6064, 106612). Alpha hydroxy acids seem to improve the appearance of aging skin by increasing smoothness and reducing dark spots (6064). The degree of exfoliation is determined by the type, concentration, and pH of the alpha hydroxy acid, as well as the other ingredients in the product. The lower the pH of the alpha hydroxy acid, the more rapidly it is absorbed into the skin (106612). Alpha hydroxy acids that are small in molecular size per volume are more active and penetrate the skin more deeply than larger alpha hydroxy acids. Citric acid is the largest in molecular size (10102).\n\nThe exfoliating action of alpha hydroxy acids reduces the thickness of the stratum corneum by diminishing corneocyte cohesion at the lower, newly forming levels, but not the mature upper levels, of the stratum corneum. This improves the flexibility of the stratum corneum and the skin surface. The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown. However, some researchers think alpha hydroxy acids interfere with the function of the enzymes involved in the formation of ionic sulfate and phosphate bonds in the stratum corneum (10104).\nGastrointestinal effects\nCitric acid is sometimes used as part of the 13C-urea breath test, a test used to determine Helicobacter pylori infection diagnosis and eradication treatment efficacy. Citric acid is used to increase the diagnosis accuracy of the test, possibly by increasing urea hydrolysis by H. pylori, decreasing stomach pH, and/or slowing gastric emptying (108187, 108188).\nRenal effects\nUrinary citrate levels of less than 1.67 mmol are a possible risk factor for kidney stones. Citrate seems to prevent crystal formation by binding to calcium and reducing levels of free calcium. It also binds to the surface of calcium oxalate to prevent crystal growth and possible binding to renal epithelial cells (108186). However, the actual impact of urinary citrate on kidney stone formation is unclear.\n\nCitric acid is found in high levels in lemons, lemon juice, and lemonade, which are a popular treatment for people with kidney stones. Consuming lemon products seems to increase urinary citrate levels (15170). Lemon contains about 49 grams of citric acid per kilogram or 48 grams per liter of juice. Lime contains 48 grams citric acid per liter of juice (15170, 108186). This is significantly higher than other fruits such as orange (11 grams/kg), grapefruit (14 grams/kg), pineapple (6 grams/kg), cranberry (11 grams/kg), or raspberry (17 grams/kg) (15170, 108186). However, it is theorized that the efficacy of each fruit for reducing kidney stone formation may be dependent on multiple factors. The citrate in lemon is complexed with a proton, which might decrease its ability to alkalinize the urine. Comparatively, the citrate content in oranges is primarily complexed with potassium. When lemonade and orange juice products are diluted to contain an equal amount of citrate, orange juice raises urinary pH and urinary citrate to a greater extent than lemonade (15171). In clinical research, consuming 85 mL of freshly squeezed lemon juice (containing 60 mEq citrate) daily for 3 months increased urinary citrate by 2.5-fold, which is equally effective to conventional treatment with potassium citrate 60 mEq daily (93472). Other research shows that intake of potassium citrate increases urine pH, as well as urinary levels of potassium and citrate. However, intake of citric acid did not increase urinary citrate or potassium levels (108185)."

It might also increase the number of children cured by day 3. A meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials involving 2209 children shows that taking smectite clay as an adjuvant to rehydration therapy reduces the duration of acute infectious diarrhea by about 24 hours compared to control in infants and children aged one month and older. Low quality research also shows that taking smectite clay increases the rate of clinical resolution by day 3 about 2-fold; however, this reduction is not significant when studies with high risk of bias are excluded from the analysis. Taking smectite clay also appear to modestly reduce stool output by about one deposition per day compared to control (98646). However, a meta-analysis of mainly moderate quality research in children with acute diarrhea shows that taking clay is less effective for reducing the duration of diarrhea when compared with tui na, a form of therapeutic pediatric massage (101813).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Clinical research shows that taking calcium aluminosilicate clay 1 gram orally four times daily for 6 weeks does not reduce severity of symptoms compared to placebo in patients with metastatic colon cancer and moderate to severe chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. However, the low overall rate of severe diarrhea might have contributed to the lack of effect of clay in this study (98648).\nDiarrhea. Preliminary clinical research in adults with chronic diarrhea shows that taking a specific clay powder product, (Smecta, EP Plus Group), 3 grams orally three times a day for 35 days improves diarrhea scores, but not the frequency of diarrhea, when compared with baseline. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.

Other preliminary clinical research suggests that taking beidellitic montmorillonite, a purified clay containing a double aluminum and magnesium silicate, 3 grams three times daily for 8 weeks significantly improves pain and discomfort compared to placebo in patients with constipation-predominant IBS but not those with diarrhea-predominant IBS (26612). However, some preliminary clinical research suggests that taking a sachet of clay containing beidellitic montmorillonite 3 grams plus aluminum hydroxide 125 mg three times daily for 8 weeks is less effective at improving intestinal transit time and reducing the need for analgesics and antispasmodics in patients with IBS than taking a specific mucilage product containing karaya gum plus polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (Polykaraya, Synthelabo) (26644).\nOral mucositis. Preliminary clinical research shows that applying a cream containing dioctahedral smectite and iodine glycerin four times daily for 5 days starting at the appearance of oral mucositis shortens oral mucositis duration by about 4 days compared with using a saline mouth rinse containing gentamicin and vitamin B12. Complete regression occurred in 86% of patients using the smectite cream compared with only 3% of patients using the mouth rinse (98652).

Clay material has been reported to remove 81% of microcystin-LR hepatotoxins from water, and may offer an effective method of stripping these toxins from drinking water supplies (26639).\nGastrointestinal effects\nClay is commonly used for various gastrointestinal issues. In human research, taking montmorillonite clay powder 3 grams twice daily improves the intestinal mucosal barrier in children with altered barrier function. The powder possibly binds to mucosal glycoproteins and covers the mucosa (98645). Other possible mechanisms related to gastrointestinal health include reduced inflammation of the intestinal barrier and adsorptive properties (98646).\nHypokalemic effect\nClay possesses potassium-binding capacity; chronic clay ingestion has been associated with severe hypokalemia (26604, 26605, 26606, 107378).\nIron-depleting effect\nClay may act as a cation exchange resin. Calcium and magnesium in clay are replaced by iron, making iron unabsorbable because of formation of insoluble iron complexes (26607).\nProtection from aflatoxins\nAflatoxins are toxic substances from the spores of the fungus Aspergillus flavus. Aflatoxin exposure has been associated with the development of liver cancers in humans and multiple cancer types in animals. Phyllosilicate clay has been shown to tightly bind aflatoxins in aqueous solutions (26640). Adding aflatoxin-selective clay (HSACS) or calcium montmorillonite clay to animal and human diets has been shown to diminish or block exposure to aflatoxins.

            "Overview": "Clove is a medium-sized tree that is native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia (92158). Due to the popular use of clove flower buds in tobacco products and as a culinary spice, clove is now grown in many other countries, including India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Brazil (92158, 92159). In Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, it has been traditionally used to treat respiratory and digestive conditions and as an analgesic and antispasmodic (43683, 92158, 92159, 92802).",
            "Warnings": "Clove cigarettes can cause severe complications, including respiratory injury, hypoxia, and pulmonary edema (17, 16384, 43599). In infants and children, taking clove oil by mouth has been associated with severe liver damage (6, 17, 43385, 43395, 43419, 43457, 43652).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Clove, clove oil, and eugenol have Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status for use in foods in the US (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when clove oil is applied topically (272). A clove oil 1% cream has been applied to the anus with apparent safety for up to 6 weeks (43487). A liposome-based product containing clove oil 45% has been applied to the palms with apparent safety for up to 2 weeks (100596).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when clove smoke is inhaled. Smoking clove cigarettes can cause respiratory injury (17, 43599). ...when clove oil is injected intravenously. This can cause pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, and acute dyspnea (16384).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of using clove orally in medicinal amounts.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY UNSAFE when clove oil is taken orally. Ingesting 5-10 mL of undiluted clove oil has been linked to reports of coagulopathy, liver damage, and other serious side effects in infants and children up to 3 years of age (6, 17, 43385, 43395, 43419, 43457, 43652).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts found in foods (4912).

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, clove is well tolerated when consumed as a spice; however, clove oil in doses of only 5-10 mL can be toxic in children. Topically, clove is generally well tolerated. When inhaled or used intravenously, clove may be unsafe.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nTopically: Burning, contact dermatitis, dental decay, itching, mucous membrane irritation, tingling, ulcers.\n\nInhaled: Dental decay, hypertension, itching, tachycardia.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Liver failure, respiratory distress.\n\nInhaled: Pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, respiratory distress.\nCardiovascular\nSmoking clove cigarettes increases heart rate and systolic blood pressure (12892).\nless\nDental\nPopulation research has found that the risk of dental decay is increased in clove cigarette smokers (43332). Repeated topical application of clove in the mouth can cause gingival damage and skin and mucous membrane irritation (4, 272, 512). Eugenol, a constituent of clove and a material commonly found in dentistry, has been associated with side effects including gum inflammation and irritation (43365, 43373, 43522).\nless\nDermatologic\nThe American Dental Association has accepted clove for professional use, but not nonprescription use, due to potential damage to soft tissue that may be induced by clove application. In clinical research, small aphthous-like ulcers appeared in the area of the mouth where clove gel was applied in four participants (43448). Skin irritation and stinging have been reported with clove oil application (43338, 43626). In a 24-year-old, exposure to a clove oil spill resulted in permanent local anesthesia and anhidrosis, or lack of sweating, at the affected area (43626).\nless\nEndocrine\nA case of hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis have been reported after administration of one teaspoon of clove oil to a seven-month-old infant (43457). A case of electrolyte imbalance following accidental ingestion by a seven-month-old has also been reported (6).\nless\nHematologic\nA case of disseminated intravascular coagulation has been reported in a 2-year-old patient after consuming between 5-10 mL of clove oil. The patient was treated with heparin, fresh frozen plasma, protein C, factor VII, and antithrombin III. On the fifth day, the patient started to improve and made a full recovery (43652).\nless\nHepatic\nThere are three cases of hepatic failure occurring in children after ingestion of 5-10 mL of clove oil (43395, 43419, 43652). Liver injury also occurred in a 3-year-old male (96949). These patients were successfully treated with N-acetylcysteine. The course of liver injury seems to be milder and shorter with early N-acetylcysteine treatment (43395, 43419, 96949). Another patient, who also presented with disseminated intravascular coagulation, was successfully treated with heparin, fresh frozen plasma, protein C, factor VII, and antithrombin III (43652).\nless\nImmunologic\nContact dermatitis and urticaria has been reported following topical exposure to clove oil or eugenol, a constituent of clove oil (12635, 43339, 43606, 43346).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nCNS depression has been reported in a 7-month-old who was given one teaspoon of clove oil accidentally in place of mineral oil for diarrhea. The patient was successfully treated with supportive care and gastric lavage (43457). A case of confusion and inability to speak has been reported secondary to oral exposure to clove oil and alcohol. The patient required intubation and was successfully treated with thiamine and normal saline (43580). Seizure and coma have been reported in a two-year-old male after ingesting 5-10 mL of clove oil (43652).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nClove cigarettes have been associated with throat and chest tightness (43337), pulmonary edema (43618), and fatal aspiration pneumonitis (43599). The causative factor may be clove alone or clove along with other substances found in cigarettes. Clove cigarettes contain significant amounts of nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide and increase plasma levels of nicotine and exhaled carbon monoxide, which might cause long-term health effects similar to tobacco smoking (12892). According to the American Medical Association, inhaling clove cigarette smoke has been associated with severe lung injury in a few susceptible individuals with prodromal respiratory infection. Also, some individuals with normal respiratory tracts have apparently suffered aspiration pneumonitis as the result of a diminished gag reflex induced by a local anesthetic action of eugenol, which is volatilized into the smoke (43602).\n\nIntravenous injection of clove oil in a 32-year-old female resulted in hypoxia, acute dyspnea, interstitial and alveolar infiltrates, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient was managed with supplemental oxygen and recovered over the next seven days (16384).\n\nOccupational exposure to eugenol, a constituent of clove, has also been reported to cause asthma and rhinitis (43492).\nless\nRenal\nProteinuria and other urinary abnormalities were observed in a seven-month-old infant given one teaspoon of clove oil accidentally in place of mineral oil for diarrhea. The patient was successfully treated with supportive care and gastric lavage (43457).\nless",

Clove mouthwash might reduce the risk of acquiring pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilation.\nA large clinical trial in adults in the intensive care unit on mechanical ventilation shows that administration of a clove extract 6.66% mouthwash, 15 mL twice daily for 5 days, results in a 2-fold lower incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia when compared with chlorhexidine mouthwash (112151).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlveolar osteitis. Although there has been interest in using topical clove for alveolar osteitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of clove for this purpose.\nAnal fissures. It is unclear if topical clove oil is beneficial in patients with anal fissures.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with chronic anal fissures shows that applying clove oil 1% cream for 6 weeks heals fissures in 60% of patients by the 3-month follow-up, compared with only 12% of patients who used topical lidocaine 5% cream and stool softeners (43487).\nless\nCough. Although there has been interest in using oral clove for cough, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of clove for this purpose.\nDental plaque.

Although there has been interest in using oral clove for halitosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of clove for this purpose.\nHangover. It is unclear if oral clove flower extract is beneficial for reducing hangover severity.\nPreliminary clinical research in a very small number of healthy males with a history of hangovers shows that taking a clove flower bud polyphenol extract 250 mg prior to drinking brandy (42.8% alcohol) decreases hangover severity scores by around 55% when compared with placebo (100597).\nless\nHyperhidrosis. It is unclear if topical clove oil is beneficial in patients with hyperhidrosis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hyperhidrosis of the palms shows that topical application of clove oil 45% in liposome base twice daily for 2 weeks improves hyperhidrosis severity and decreases the rate of sweating by around 34% when compared with a saline control (100596). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of subject randomization.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral clove flower extract is beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in a very small number of patients with prediabetes shows that taking a polyphenolic extract from clove flower buds 250 mg daily for 30 days decreases pre-prandial plasma glucose by 14 mg/dL and postprandial plasma glucose by 40 mg/dL when compared to baseline (100595). The validity of these findings is limited by the very small size of the study and the lack of a control group.\nless\nMosquito repellent. Small clinical studies suggest that topical clove oil may repel mosquitos for up to 4-5 hours.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that topical application of undiluted clove oil can repel 100% of mosquitoes for up to 4 hours (43427). Other preliminary research shows that topical application of gel containing clove oil 20% can repel 86% to 97% of mosquitoes for 5 hours (43411).\nless\nNausea and vomiting. Although there has been interest in using oral clove for nausea and vomiting, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of clove for this purpose.\nOral mucositis. Although there has been interest in using topical clove for oral mucositis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of clove for this purpose.\nPain (acute). It is unclear if topical clove is beneficial in patients with acute pain.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that topical application of a gel containing ground cloves, applied as 4 grams of gel for 5 minutes prior to dental anesthesia injection, can reduce needle stick pain when compared with placebo. The effect of the clove gel on pain seems to be comparable to benzocaine 20% gel (43448).\nless\nPremature ejaculation. Topical clove has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that administration of a multi-ingredient cream preparation (SS Cream) containing clove flower, Panax ginseng root, Angelica root, Cistanches deserticola, Zanthoxyl species, Torlidis seed, Asiasari root, cinnamon bark, and toad venom to the glans penis, one hour prior to intercourse and washed off immediately before intercourse, increases ejaculatory latency time by over 4-fold when compared with placebo in adults with premature ejaculation (2537). It is unclear whether clove, another ingredient, or a combination of these ingredients is responsible for these effects.\nless\nPruritus. There is limited evidence on the topical use of clove oil in patients with chronic pruritus.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with chronic pruritus shows that applying clove oil 10% in petroleum jelly to the skin twice daily for 2 weeks reduces the daily duration of itching by 48 minutes and improves symptom severity and disability scores when compared with placebo (96950).\nless\nSmoking cessation. Oral clove has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults in India with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing clove 30 mg, ashwagandha, cowhage, ginger, turmeric, and other herbal extracts (Smotect, Smotect India) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked daily and levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity when compared with placebo (112115). It is unclear if these effects are due to clove, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate clove for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of clove.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of clove are the oils, flowers, flower buds, leaves, and stems. Clove oil contains up to 95% eugenol. Clove bud oil contains 60% to 90% eugenol, clove leaf oil contains 82% to 88% eugenol, and clove stem oil contains 90% to 95% eugenol (11). Clove oil also contains beta-caryophyllene, which is approximately 13% of the oil (92159). In fresh plant material, concentrations of eugenol range from approximately 9300 to 14,600 mg per 100 grams (92158, 92159). Other constituents of clove include alpha-humulene, caffeic acid, carvacrol, chlorogenic acid, and other polyphenols and terpenes (32482, 43460, 43481, 92802, 92803).\nAnesthetic effects\nEugenol is the main constituent of clove oil. Clove oil is commonly used topically as an anesthetic. The constituent eugenol has been shown to have anesthetic properties when applied topically in human research (43592). Laboratory research suggests that eugenol alters the activity of sodium, potassium, and calcium channels as well as other receptors (43386, 43432, 43468, 43494, 43502, 43530, 92158). Also, eugenol might inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis and thereby depress pain sensory receptors (43500). Other clove constituents, such as beta-caryophyllene, also reduce the pain response in animal models (43355).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro studies show that clove has anticancer effects in various cell lines via inhibition of cell growth and adherence, interference with cell signaling, induction of apoptosis, and generation of reactive oxygen species (30642, 43409, 43421, 43438, 43447, 43571, 43583, 92158, 92159, 92802). Oleanolic acid and other compounds likely play a role (92802).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nClove oil is used topically as an anti-inflammatory agent. The constituent eugenol is the component responsible for clove's anti-inflammatory effects. Eugenol inhibits or modulates enzymes involved in the inflammatory cascade and decreases production of inflammatory mediators (12678, 43367, 43379, 43436, 43485, 43528, 43601). Also, clove oil modulates the activity of cells involved in inflammation, such as macrophages and neutrophils (43501, 43611, 43667).\nAnti-platelet effects\nClove has been associated with the inhibition of platelet aggregation, at least partially by inhibiting thromboxane synthesis (43654).\nAntihistamine effects\nAnimal research suggests that clove, specifically eugenol, exhibits antihistamine and antianaphylaxis activity (43666, 43669). Antiallergenic effects of eugenol may be attributed to the induction of apoptosis of mast cells (43412).\nAntimicrobial effects\nClove oil is used topically to prevent dental plaque. Laboratory research suggests that oil of clove has both antibacterial and antifungal effects. Eugenol is likely the main constituent of interest for these effects. Constituents in clove oil prevent cellular communication and toxin production by microbes (2130, 30629, 31405, 43336, 43402, 43441, 43442, 43470, 43478, 43486)(43520, 43538, 43595, 43638, 43668, 92158). The antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of eugenol in clove are also proposed to reduce the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia when administered as a mouthwash by decreasing the microbial migration into the lower respiratory tract while on mechanical ventilation (112151).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, the essential oil of clove bud demonstrates antioxidant activity. The oils provide antioxidant protection for cumene at 1mg/L, and for more highly oxidizable squalene at 100 mg/L. with greater duration of protection with clove bud when compared to thyme and savory. Antioxidant activity is due primarily to the phenolic compound eugenoll (112312).\nDental effects\nClove oil and its constituent eugenol have long been used topically for toothache. However, the FDA reclassified eugenol from Category I, meaning that it was safe and effective as it was labeled, to category III, meaning there is insufficient data to support efficacy (272).\nGastrointestinal effects\nClove oil is traditionally used to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms. This may be related to the constituent eugenol which has shown to protect against ulcers in animal models. Eugenol has antioxidant effects and increases mucin secretion (43507, 43517).\nGlycemic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that polyphenols extracted from clove flower buds inhibit glucose production in hepatocytes, enhance the uptake of glucose in muscle cells, and inhibit the activity of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase (100595).\nHangover-mitigating effects\nThe effects of a polyphenol extract from clove flower buds on hangover symptoms, demonstrated in a small clinical study, are thought to be related to the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gastroprotective effects of clove polyphenols. Taking clove flower bud polyphenol extract immediately prior to drinking alcohol increases the clearance of acetaldehyde, the alcohol metabolite responsible for hangovers, by around 2.5-fold (100597).\nInsecticidal effects\nEugenol, eugenol acetate, and beta-carophyllene constituents are likely the active insecticidal components of clove oil. Clove oil has been used to repel and kill insects, including mosquitos (92158).\nReproductive effects\nLaboratory research suggests that clove oil has potent spermicidal activity (43608). In animal research, clove flower extract induced degenerative changes in the seminiferous tubules associated with a decrease in daily sperm production (43509)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of cnidium are the fruit, seed, and whole plant. The active constituents of cnidium are thought to be its coumarin derivatives including osthol, imperatorin, isopimpinellin, xanthotoxin, and bergapten (12218, 103851). Additional coumarins have also been identified including cnidimonal, cnidimarin, and others (13020, 103851). Other constituents include hemiterpenoids, monoterpenoids, and aromatic glucosides (13018, 103851).\nAnti-cancer effects\nCnidium fruit extracts have anticancer effects in various animal and in vitro models (103851). Extracts have cytotoxic activity against many cancer cells, including pancreatic, breast, cervical, colorectal, and leukemic cancer cells. The coumarin constituent osthol seems to have the strongest cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. Both osthol and imperatorin induce apoptosis of HL-60 human leukemia cells. These compounds seem to interfere with cellular signalling (12529, 103851).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn laboratory research, cnidium and its constituent osthol have shown anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of cnidium might play a role in its potential clinical effects related to conditions such as cancer and skin disorders. Osthol reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines and increases the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in animal models (103851).\nAnti-microbial effects\nCnidium is used orally and topically for fungal and bacterial infections. In vitro, cnidium extract or its constituents had antibacterial and antifungal effects (103851).\nBone density effects\nThere is interest in using cnidium for osteoporosis. Coumarin constituents of the fruit extract seem to increase bone density by stimulating bone formation and reducing bone resorption. In vitro, osthol is more active on osteoblast proliferation than imperatorin and bergapten (13017).\nDermatological effects\nAn extract of cnidium fruit and the purified osthol and isopimpinellin constituents seem to have an antipruritic effect in animal models. But this effect does not seem to be as potent as the antihistamine diphenhydramine (Benadryl) (12218). Other laboratory research suggests cnidium fruit extract inhibits itching induced by substance P without causing sedation. Substance P is increased in patients with skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (12623). The constituent osthol has shown anti-inflammatory effects in animal models (103851). Cnidium fruit extracts and the osthol constituent also seem to have an antiallergy effect in animal models, possibly by affecting cellular signalling (12217, 103851).\nHepatoprotective effects\nThere is interest in using cnidium to prevent liver damage. Sesquiterpene constituents, torilolone and 1-hydroxytorilin, seem to protect against tacrine-induced liver cytotoxicity in vitro (12572).\nSexual performance effects\nCnidium is used to improve sexual performance. There is some evidence from an animal model that the coumarin constituents of cnidium fruit have a relaxing effect on the corpus cavernosum.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, cobalt seems to be well-tolerated when taken for up to 90 days in small amounts. Taking cobalt orally long-term or in high doses may cause cardiomyopathy, hearing loss, and vision loss (102066, 102068, 102077). Topically, cobalt-containing products can cause allergic contact dermatitis in some patients (102070, 102071, 102072, 102073). Occupational exposure to cobalt dust may cause cardiomyopathy, interstitial lung disease, and hearing and vision loss in some people (102066, 102067, 102068, 102077). Exposure to cobalt from cobalt-containing prosthetic joints has been linked to cardiomyopathy, dermatitis, hypothyroidism, hearing loss, and vision loss (102066, 102068, 102070, 102074, 102076, 102077).\nCardiovascular\nOral, occupational, and systemic exposure to cobalt may cause cardiomyopathy. While rare, this adverse effect has been reported in patients taking cobalt for anemia, consuming cobalt-fortified beer, working in industries with exposure to cobalt dust, and those with cobalt-containing prosthetic joints (102066, 102076). Patients who consume a low protein diet, are thiamine deficient, or who have hypothyroidism appear to be at a greater risk of cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy. Cobalt-related cardiomyopathy can be distinguished from non-cobalt-related cardiomyopathy by its rapid onset and progression (102066).\nless\nDermatologic\nTopically, cobalt can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Numerous cases of allergic skin reactions have been reported after contact with cobalt in leather goods, jewelry, nail polishes, cobalt blue tattoo ink, and cement (102069, 102070, 102071, 102072). Dermatitis has also been reported in patients with occupations that involve the production or handling of ceramics, enamel, glass, heavy metals, pigments, or electrical components, as cobalt is extensively used in these industries (102070, 102073). Exposure to cobalt found in prosthetic joints and other metallic surgical implants has also been reported to cause generalized dermatitis in some patients (102070).\nless\nEndocrine\nExposure to cobalt-containing prosthetic joints may cause hypothyroidism in some patients (102074, 102076).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nExposure to cobalt may cause reversible neurologic adverse effects in some patients (102074, 102076, 102077). Demyelinating neuropathy, cognitive decline, headaches, depression, convulsions, and forgetfulness have been reported in patients with cobalt-containing hip joint prostheses (102074, 102077). Vertigo and impairment in memory and attention have been reported after occupational exposure to cobalt (102077).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOral, occupational, and systemic exposure to cobalt may cause adverse ocular and otic effects. While rare, reversible and irreversible vision loss, optic neuropathy and atrophy, signs of abnormal retinal functioning, hearing loss, bilateral deafness, and tinnitus have been reported in patients taking cobalt for anemia, working in industries with exposure to cobalt dust, and those with cobalt-containing prosthetic joints (102068, 102074, 102077).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOccupational exposure to cobalt can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD). Patients with subacute cobalt-related ILD may present with dyspnea, cough, fevers, chills, and weight loss a few months to years after exposure, and symptoms typically resolve after removal of the exposure. Patients with chronic cobalt-related ILD experience a more gradual development of dyspnea and cough which generally do not improve after removal of the exposure. Chronic cobalt-related ILD can progress to end-stage fibrosis and death. While removal of exposure is the mainstay of treatment, some case reports show that inhaled or systemic corticosteroids can improve symptoms and radiographic signs of cobalt-related ILD (102067).\nless\nOther\nExposure to cobalt-containing prosthetic joints may cause pseudotumor formation near the replaced joints (102074, 102075, 102076).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nSystemic uptake and average serum levels of cobalt after oral intake appear to be higher in women than men (102081, 102082). In one pharmacokinetic study, taking cobalt chloride 1 mg daily for 90 days resulted in greater serum and whole blood cobalt levels in women when compared with men. The average serum cobalt levels were 71 mcg/L and 25 mcg/L in women and men, respectively (102081). Steady-state concentrations of cobalt are achieved after 14-24 days of once daily dosing (102082).\nExcretion\nCobalt appears to follow a two-phase elimination curve. This is likely explained by the sequestering of cobalt by red blood cells, which have a 120-day life span. Cobalt's elimination half-life in both serum and whole blood is around 3 days in the first phase of elimination. In the second phase, cobalt has a half-life of 16-22 days and 36-39 days in serum and whole blood, respectively (102081, 102082).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCobalt is a metal element. The cobalt ions cobaltus (Co^2+) and cobaltic (Co^3+) are the predominant valence states of cobalt. Cobaltus is found most often in nature and is commonly used commercially (102079).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that cobalt has both beneficial and harmful cardiovascular effects. Cobalt appears to modulate the cardiovascular system's ability to respond to hypoxic stress by increasing the synthesis of erythropoietin, increasing the expression of hypoxia-induced factor 1, inducing vascular endothelial growth factor, and increasing the activity of enzymes involved in glycolysis. However, cobalt also appears to depress cardiac function and change the structure of cardiac cells by interfering with the binding and activity of calcium in heart tissue, increasing generation of reactive oxygen species, interrupting the citric acid cycle, and inhibiting the production of adenosine triphosphate (102066).\nErythropoietic effects\nIn hypoxic conditions, cobalt stabilizes hypoxia-induced factor 1-alpha and 2-alpha. This seems to increase the production of erythropoietin (EPO) in the kidney and liver, suggesting that cobalt may be useful for enhancing athletic performance and treating anemia (102083). However, clinical research on the erythropoietic effects of cobalt is mixed (102081, 102082, 102083). Taking cobalt chloride 1 mg daily for up to 90 days does not appear to increase hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell (RBC) counts (102081, 102082). Additionally, while one study shows that taking a single dose of cobalt 5 mg increases plasma EPO by 20.5% and that a 10 mg dose increases EPO by nearly 53% when compared to baseline, improvements in hematocrit, hemoglobin, and RBC counts were lacking. In another study, taking cobalt 10 mg, but not 5 mg, daily for 5 days increased EPO by 27% when compared to baseline, with no improvement in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC counts. Earlier research shows that higher doses of cobalt chloride 25-150 mg can increase hemoglobin levels and RBC counts; however, these doses may be unsafe (102083).\nPulmonary effects\nThe adverse pulmonary effects of cobalt are thought to be due to immunologic and oxidant injury-related mechanisms (102067)."

The major active constituent of coca leaves is the alkaloid, cocaine (9457, 43826). The concentration of cocaine is higher in coca grown at lower altitudes and in coca grown under drought conditions (9457). Cocaine content was found to be about 0.7% in dried leaves (43764). Other constituents include pseudococaine (43848). The leaves also contain essential oils that have not been well-identified.\nErgogenic effects\nCoca leaves are chewed to improve physical performance. However, chewing coca leaves doesn't seem to improve physical performance. Coca increases heart rate, but cardiac output is not increased. Coca leaves appear to cause a decrease in plasma volume, which blunts cardiac output resulting from increased heart rate. Coca leaves do not improve glucose or fat utilization or other physiologic responses to exercise (9455, 9456, 43820). Other human research suggests that heart rates are decreased during exercise and recovery in habitual coca leaf users (43821).\nNeurologic effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that other active constituents in coca leaves, besides cocaine, contribute to its stimulatory effects (9461, 9462).\n\nCocaine has local anesthetic, beta-1, beta-2, and alpha-adrenergic stimulating properties (17).

The bean powder is a source of phytonutrients called polyphenols, which include epicatechin and catechin. They are also found in dark unprocessed chocolate, cocoa beverages, and in processed chocolate products in smaller amounts (97252, 92272, 92274). Traditionally, cocoa seed is used for infectious intestinal diseases and lung conditions, and the seed coat is used for liver, bladder, and kidney ailments.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (13161, 14306, 14307, 14308, 15655, 15752, 17187, 92271, 92274, 103247)(103250, 108898). However, cocoa naturally contains caffeine, and caffeine may be unsafe when used orally in doses of more than 400 mg daily (11733, 98806). While most cocoa products contain only small amounts of caffeine (about 2-35 mg per serving) (2708, 3900), one cup of unsweetened, dry cocoa powder can contain up to 198 mg of caffeine (100515). To be on the safe side, cocoa should be used in amounts that provide less than 400 mg of caffeine daily. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine naturally found in ingredients such as cocoa does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. Cocoa and dark chocolate products worldwide also contain heavy metals such as lead and cadmium. In the US, one ounce (approximately 28 grams) of most commercially available dark chocolate products tested contained levels of lead and/or cadmium above the maximum allowable dose level for California, with cadmium levels generally increasing with the percentage of cocoa (109847, 109848, 109849). Advise patients to consume cocoa in moderation. ...when used topically. Cocoa butter is used extensively as a base for ointments and suppositories and is generally considered safe (11).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when dark chocolate is used orally. Cocoa and dark chocolate products worldwide contain heavy metals such as lead and cadmium. In the US, one ounce (approximately 28 grams) of most commercially available dark chocolate products tested contained levels of lead and/or cadmium above the maximum allowable dose level for California, with cadmium levels generally increasing with the percentage of cocoa (109847, 109848, 109849). Children are at increased risk of adverse effects from intake of lead and/or cadmium. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of other chocolate-based products that typically contain smaller quantities of cocoa.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. However, due to the caffeine content of cocoa preparations, intake should be closely monitored during pregnancy to ensure moderate consumption. Fetal blood concentrations of caffeine approximate maternal concentrations (4260). Some research has found that intrauterine exposure to even modest amounts of caffeine, based on maternal blood levels during the first trimester, is associated with a shorter stature in children ages 4-8 years (109846). While many cocoa products contain only small amounts of caffeine (about 2-35 mg per serving) (2708, 3900), unsweetened, dry cocoa powder can contain up to 198 mg of caffeine per cup (100515). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, doses of up to 300 mg daily can be consumed during pregnancy without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, still birth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations (11733, 98806). To be on the safe side, cocoa should be used in amounts that provide less than 300 mg of caffeine daily. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as cocoa, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Caffeine found in cocoa crosses the placenta producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels (4260). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 300 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage in some studies (16014, 98806). Additionally, high intake of caffeine during pregnancy have been associated with premature delivery, low birth weight, and loss of the fetus (6). While many cocoa products contain only small amounts of caffeine (about 2-35 mg per serving) (2708, 3900), unsweetened, dry cocoa powder can contain up to 198 mg of caffeine per cup (100515). To be on the safe side, cocoa should be used in amounts that provide less than 300 mg of caffeine daily (2708). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels.

Large doses or excessive intake of cocoa should be avoided during pregnancy.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used in moderate amounts or in amounts commonly found in foods. Due to the caffeine content of cocoa preparations, intake should be closely monitored while breastfeeding. During lactation, breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of serum concentrations. Moderate consumption of cocoa would likely result in very small amounts of caffeine exposure to a nursing infant (6). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as cocoa, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Consumption of excess chocolate (16 oz per day) may cause irritability and increased bowel activity in the infant (6026). Cocoa and dark chocolate products worldwide also contain heavy metals such as lead and cadmium. In the US, one ounce (approximately 28 grams) of most commercially available dark chocolate products tested contained levels of lead and/or cadmium above the maximum allowable dose level for California, with cadmium levels generally increasing with the percentage of cocoa (109847, 109848, 109849).

Topically, cocoa butter has occasionally caused a rash. In animals, it has been shown to block pores and cause acne; however, this has not been found in humans (11).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nIn human trials, chocolate consumption was associated with a higher incidence of flatulence, irritable bowel syndrome, upset stomach, gastric upset, borborygmi (a gurgling noise made by fluid or gas in the intestines), bloating, nausea, vomiting, and constipation or obstipation (41986, 42221, 41921, 1374, 42220, 1373, 42099, 42097, 42156, 42123, 18229, 42169, 42111).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Dietary cocoa seems to be beneficial for CVD prevention. Oral cocoa extract may reduce the risk of CVD-related death, but it is unclear if it can prevent other CVD-related outcomes like myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke.\nA large clinical trial in adults without CVD shows that taking a specific cocoa extract daily for around 3.5 years reduces the risk of CVD-related death by 27%, but does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including MI or stroke, or overall mortality when compared with placebo. This specific cocoa extract contained 500 mg of flavanols, including 80 mg of epicatechins (108898). In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that very limited scientific evidence suggests that the cocoa flavanols in high flavanol cocoa powder, for products containing at least 4% naturally conserved cocoa flavanols, may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (110017).\n\nObservational research in adults without CVD has also found that consuming a higher amount of cocoa is associated with a 10% lower risk of CVD and an up to 50% lower risk of CVD-related mortality when compared with consuming lower amounts of cocoa. Consuming more than 90 grams of cocoa per week did not add further benefit (14288, 97192). Additional clinical research shows that taking cocoa flavanols 450 mg twice daily for one month improves cholesterol levels and blood pressure values, resulting in improved Framingham Risk Scores in healthy patients. These scores correspond to a 21% decrease in the 10-year risk for coronary heart disease, a 22% decrease in the risk for CVD, a 31% decrease in the risk for MI, and a 30% decrease in the risk for CVD-related mortality (92273). There is also evidence that consuming cocoa might improve flow-mediated dilatation, a measure of endothelial dysfunction. Meta-analyses of clinical research have found that increased cocoa or chocolate intake significantly improves flow-mediated dilatation. This is seen with intakes of 19-54 grams of cocoa daily, 46-100 grams of dark chocolate daily, or cocoa products containing 16.6-1080 mg of flavonoids daily (17187, 42059, 42137).\nless\nHypertension. Oral cocoa seems to be beneficial for modestly decreasing blood pressure in hypertensive patients. It is unclear if dietary cocoa is beneficial for preventing hypertension.\nOverall, clinical research shows that chocolate or cocoa containing 25-1080 mg daily of flavonoids modestly reduces blood pressure in hypertensive patients (14306, 15655, 15752, 42092, 42107, 42169, 97190, 103247). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that consuming commercially available dark chocolate or flavanol-enriched chocolate/cocoa products daily for 2-8 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) by around 4 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by around 2 mmHg in patients with hypertension when compared to control products with low levels of flavanols or no flavanols (42169, 97190). Additionally, a meta-analysis of clinical trials in middle-aged and elderly patients with or without hypertension shows that consuming cocoa products daily for 4-18 weeks reduces SBP and DBP by around 3 mmHg and 1.5 mmHg, respectively, when compared with control products (103249). Blood pressure lowering seems to occur more readily in hypertensive or pre-hypertensive individuals when compared with normotensive individuals (14306, 15655, 15752, 42092, 42107, 42169, 97190, 103247).\n\nConsumption of cocoa might also reduce the risk of developing hypertension in normotensive patients. Observational research has found that long-term consumption of moderate amounts of cocoa (2.2 grams to 6.1 grams daily) is associated with a 7% lower risk of hypertension when compared with consumption of less than 0.61 grams daily. However, consumption of amounts greater than 6.1 grams daily does not seem to reduce hypertension risk. Also, this benefit seems to be limited to patients consuming cocoa from plain chocolate, as consumption of cocoa from desserts was linked with a 9% greater risk of hypertension (103248).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nHypercholesterolemia. Oral cocoa does not seem to be beneficial for reducing cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nSome preliminary clinical research in healthy, normocholesterolemic males shows that diets high in stearic acid from cocoa butter result in lower cholesterol levels when compared with diets high in myristic acid from dairy butter. However, a diet high in stearic acid from cocoa butter does not significantly lower cholesterol when compared to baseline in this population (15063). A meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies shows that cocoa or dark chocolate can reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in normocholesterolemic patients (42125). However, some preliminary clinical research in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that drinking a high-flavanol cocoa beverage daily for 6 weeks does not reduce cholesterol when compared with a low-flavanol cocoa beverage (42013). Also, while some clinical research shows that taking cocoa powder 26 grams with sugar daily for 12 weeks can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with sugar alone in normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic patients (42026), taking cocoa or dark chocolate 13-41 grams daily does not seem to lower total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol in these patients (42026, 42029, 42225).\nless\nStretch marks (striae distensae). Topical cocoa butter does not seem to be beneficial for preventing stretch marks.\nClinical research shows that topical application with a cream containing cocoa butter 25% to the abdomen daily, starting during the second and third trimesters and continuing until delivery, does not prevent stretch marks when compared with a placebo cream (105261). Other clinical research shows that topical application with a cream containing cocoa butter and vitamin E as tocopheryl acetate to the abdomen, breasts, and thighs, daily, starting during the second trimester and continuing until delivery, does not reduce the prevalence or severity of stretch marks when compared to a cream not containing these ingredients (105262). More research is needed in individuals of all skin types.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral cocoa is beneficial for improving cognitive function in healthy older adults.\nSome small clinical studies in healthy adults over the age of 60 with or without existing cognitive impairment show that sub-chronic intake of cocoa at doses of 45 mg, 520 mg, or 990 mg once daily for 8 weeks, or as a cocoa drink containing flavanols 609 mg daily for 30 days, modestly improves some measures of cognitive function, including task switching, visual attention, and verbal fluency (42184, 92269). However, it does not improve performance on the mini mental state exam (92269). Also, one clinical study in healthy adults aged 60 years and older shows that consuming a dark chocolate bar containing 11 grams of cocoa and drinking 237 mL of an artificially sweetened drink containing 11 grams of cocoa daily for 6 weeks does not improve neuropsychological function when compared with placebo (42050). Additional preliminary clinical research in postmenopausal females aged 50-64 years shows that adding chocolate 10 grams daily, containing 99% cocoa, for 6 months does not improve most measures of cognitive function when compared with not taking cocoa (105259). Reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may relate to the dose of cocoa, the duration of intake, or the specific cognitive testing procedures conducted.\nless\nAge-related testosterone deficiency. Oral cocoa has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy middle-aged adults shows that taking a combination product containing cocoa seed extract and pomegranate rind (Tesnor, Gencor) daily for 56 days increases serum testosterone levels and hand-grip strength and improves measures of sexual function and psychological well-being when compared with placebo (111527). It is unclear if these effects are due to cocoa, pomegranate, or the combination.\nless\nAging skin. It is unclear if oral cocoa is beneficial for aging skin.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with aging skin shows taking a specific product (GliSODin Skin Nutrients Advanced Anti-Aging Formula, Isocell North America Inc.) 780 mg three times daily, containing cocoa extract, as well as superoxide dismutase, krill oil, sea buckthorn, hyaluronic acid, and other nutrients, in combination with daily use of tazarotene cream 0.1%, for 90 days improves fine wrinkling, photodamage, and skin elasticity when compared with tazarotene cream and placebo (91778). Additional preliminary clinical research in patients with photoaged skin shows that drinking a cocoa drink containing 320 mg of flavanols daily for 24 weeks improves wrinkle depth and skin elasticity, but not skin hydration, when compared with placebo (92274).\nless\nAsthma. Although there has been interest in using oral cocoa for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cocoa for this condition.\nAthletic performance. Although there has been interest in using oral cocoa for improving athletic performance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cocoa for this use.\nAtrial fibrillation. It is unclear if dietary cocoa is beneficial for preventing atrial fibrillation.\nMost population research has found that chocolate consumption is not associated with a reduced risk of atrial fibrillation (97188, 97189).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral cocoa is beneficial for CFS.\nIn patients with CFS, preliminary clinical research shows that consuming 45 grams of a polyphenol-rich chocolate in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks can reduce fatigue by 35%, anxiety by 37%, and depression by 45%, and can increase overall function by 30%, when compared with pretreatment (42116).\nless\nCirrhosis. It is unclear if oral cocoa is beneficial for cirrhosis.\nClinical research shows that consuming a liquid test meal (Ensure Plus) in addition to dark chocolate (Lindt Excellence 85% Cocoa, Lindt & Sprüngli) 0.55 grams/kg can reduce the postprandial increase in hepatic venous pressure gradient in patients with cirrhosis when compared with the test drink alone (42164).\nless\nCognitive function. Research on the use of oral cocoa for improving cognitive function in healthy adults is conflicting.\nA large clinical trial in older adults shows that taking cocoa extract containing 500 mg of flavanols daily for 3 years does not improve measures of cognitive function including global cognition, episodic memory, and executive function when compared with placebo, even when taken with a multivitamin-mineral product (Centrum Silver) (111524). Also, in middle-aged participants, clinical research shows that taking 20 grams of a dark chocolate drink mix containing 250 mg or 500 mg of polyphenols as a single dose does not seem to improve measures of cognitive function (92272).\n\nIn contrast, clinical research in healthy younger individuals shows that consuming a single dose of cocoa flavanols 520-994 mg as a specific powder (Cocoapro) improves some, but not all, measures of cognitive function when examined in a situation of sustained mental effort (42093). Additionally, consuming a single dose of cocoa flavanols 900 mg as a specific powder (Acticoa) seems to improve reaction time during cognitive testing when compared with placebo in healthy adults and patients with type 1 diabetes (103251). However, acute dosing with cocoa flavanols 374-747 mg as specific powders (Acticoa) or cocoa extract capsules (Naturex) does not seem to improve measures of cognitive function, visual working memory, or ability to focus during testing in young people (99984, 99985, 109448). Reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may relate to the dose of cocoa, the duration of intake, the level of stress during cognitive testing, or the specific cognitive testing procedures conducted.\nless\nCognitive impairment. Oral cocoa flavanols have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study in adults at least 55 years of age with subjective or mild cognitive impairment shows that consuming dark chocolate containing 500 mg cocoa flavanols and taking fish oil containing DHA 1.1 grams and EPA 0.4 grams daily for 12 months does not improve cognitive function scores when compared with placebo (111453).\nless\nConstipation. Oral cocoa husk has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with chronic constipation shows that taking 2-4 sachets containing cocoa husk 8-16 grams and beta-fructosans 2-4 grams daily for 4 weeks can reduce hard stools by 45% and reduce transit time by 36 hours when compared with a placebo (42016).\nless\nDiabetes. Several small clinical studies suggest that oral cocoa may cause small but clinically insignificant improvements in glycemic control in patients with diabetes. However, cocoa does not appear to be beneficial for the prevention of diabetes.\nWhile some individual studies show conflicting results (97252, 99982), two similar meta-analyses of 8-9 small clinical trials in patients with diabetes show that taking cocoa 1-54 grams daily for up to 52 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by around 7-9 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 10-15 mg/dL, but does not improve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin levels, blood pressure, total cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with control (109447, 109449). This slight improvement in fasting blood glucose, along with a lack of effect on HbA1c, suggests that cocoa is unlikely to lead to clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control.\n\nPopulation research has found that eating up to 60 grams of chocolate per week is associated with a lower risk of developing diabetes. Higher consumption was not found to affect diabetes risk (97192). However, secondary analysis of a large clinical study in adults aged 74 on average shows that taking an extract containing cocoa flavanols 500 mg daily, with or without a multivitamin, for about 3.5 years does not reduce the risk of developing self-reported type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis based on body mass index, level of physical activity, or multivitamin consumption did not change results (111619).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral cocoa flavanols are beneficial for preventing exercise-induced muscle damage.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a single dose of cocoa flavanols (Chococru Extraordinary Flavanol Cocoa) 830 mg or 1245 mg within 5 minutes of a strenuous exercise protocol does not reduce exercise-induced muscle damage over 72 hours when compared with a control providing no cocoa flavanols (105260).\nless\nFatigue.

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nBitter chocolate is produced by pressing roasted cocoa kernels between hot rollers. Cocoa powder is produced by expressing the cocoa butter from bitter chocolate and powdering the remaining residue. Sweet chocolate is produced by adding sugar and vanilla to bitter chocolate (13).\n\nSome chocolate products used in clinical research are standardized or characterized based on their polyphenol or theobromine content. In one trial, 20 grams of a dark chocolate drink mix was standardized to 250 mg or 500 mg (500 mg only Acticoa cocoa powder) of cocoa polyphenols (92272). In another trial, 20 grams of cocoa powder contained 960 mg polyphenols, including 201 mg proanthocyanidins, 40 mg epicatechin, and 18 mg catechin, as well as 220 mg theobromine and 21 mg caffeine (97252). A 37 gram dark chocolate bar used in another trial contained 60% cacao, approximately 11 grams natural cocoa, and 397.30 mg/gram total proanthocyanins, while a 237 mL cup of cocoa drink mix contained approximately 11 grams cocoa and 357 mg/gram total proanthocyanins (42050). In another clinical trial, each 6.3 gram dose of polyphenol-rich chocolate contained 3.1 grams cacao and 30mg polyphenols (15752). The cacoa extract used in GliSODin Skin Nutrients Advanced Anti-Aging Formula is standardized to 10% theobromine (91778). One supplement (Naturex) contained 530 mg flavanols, including 100 mg epicatechin and 23 mg catechin, as well as 119 mg theobromine and 17 mg caffeine, per 1765 mg cocoa extract (99984). Another specific cocoa powder (Chococru Extraordinary Flavanol Cocoa), containing approximately 8.3% flavanols and a total polyphenol content of approximately 12% has been used. Therefore, 10 grams of powder contained 830 mg cocoa flavanols, including 98.6 mg epicatechin (105260).\n\nCocoa and dark chocolate products worldwide contain heavy metals such as lead and cadmium. This appears to be due to absorption of these metals from the soil, with levels differing between growing locations (109847, 109848, 109849). In the US, one ounce (approximately 28 grams) of most commercially available dark chocolate products tested contained levels of lead and/or cadmium above the maximum allowable dose level for California, with cadmium levels generally increasing with the percentage of cocoa (109849).",

Human research suggests that intake of cocoa can inhibit platelet adhesion, aggregation, and activity (6085, 17076, 41948, 41957, 41958, 42014, 42145).\nless\nCARDIAC CONDITIONS\nCocoa contains caffeine, which might induce cardiac arrhythmias in sensitive individuals (11845). Use with caution.\nless\nDIABETES\nSome cocoa products contain large quantities of caffeine (17187, 42137). Research suggests that caffeine might impair postprandial glucose metabolism in people with diabetes and contribute to insulin resistance (12374, 12375). Also, caffeine may enhance the frequency and intensity of hypoglycemic warning symptoms in patients with type 1 diabetes. Theoretically, this may increase the ability of diabetics to detect and treat hypoglycemia early. However, it might also increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740). Caffeine has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose (8646); use with caution.\nless\nDIARRHEA\nUse with caution in patients with diarrhea. Cocoa contains caffeine, which can exacerbate diarrhea, especially when taken in large amounts.\nless\nEPILEPSY\nCocoa contains caffeine. Some animal research indicates that high doses of caffeine can significantly reduce seizure threshold or induce seizures (23559, 23560, 23561). Furthermore, caffeine seems to decrease the activity of various anticonvulsant drugs, including carbamazepine, ethosuximide, felbamate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate (23558, 23559, 23560, 23561, 23562, 23563). However, caffeine does not seem to affect the anticonvulsant effects of lamotrigine, tiagabine, or oxcarbazepine (23561). Patients with epilepsy should avoid using high doses of caffeine or caffeine-containing products such as cocoa; low doses of caffeine and caffeine-containing products should be used with caution.\nless\nGASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD)\nUse with caution in patients with GERD. Cocoa reduces lower esophageal sphincter pressure and might exacerbate symptoms (1374).\nless\nGLAUCOMA\nUse with caution in patients with glaucoma. Cocoa contains caffeine, which increases intraocular pressure within 30 minutes and persists for at least 90 minutes (8540).\nless\nHYPERTENSION\nUse with caution in patients with hypertension. Cocoa with caffeine can temporarily increase blood pressure. However, increases are generally small and not clinically significant, being less than the normal diurnal variation in blood pressure (98806). Regular consumption of caffeine does not seem to increase blood pressure even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722, 38335).\nless\nIRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS)\nUse with caution in patients with IBS. Cocoa contains caffeine, which might worsen symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS, especially when taken in large amounts.\nless\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nUse with caution in postmenopausal individuals identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor. Cocoa contains caffeine, which might increase urinary excretion of calcium, although it usually remains within the normal range (98806). Some sources suggest that caffeine consumption should be limited to less than 300 mg per day (approximately 2-3 cups of coffee), unless there is adequate calcium supplementation to compensate for calcium losses (2669, 10202, 11317). However, according to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, healthy adults with adequate calcium intake are not at increased risk for decreased bone mineral density, osteoporosis, or fractures with daily caffeine intakes up to 400 mg (11733, 98806). Chocolate products provide 2-35 mg caffeine per serving (2708) and a cup of hot chocolate provides approximately 10 mg (3900). Postmenopausal individuals identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to have an 8% higher risk for bone loss from caffeine (2669).\nless\nTACHYARRHYTHMIAS\nUse with caution in patients with tachyarrhythmias. Cocoa from dark chocolate 100 grams can increase heart rate (13161).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nDIPYRIDAMOLE THALLIUM IMAGING\nCocoa contains caffeine. Taking cocoa might interfere with dipyridamole thallium imaging studies. Caffeine attenuates the characteristic cardiovascular responses to dipyridamole and has altered test results (11742).\nless\nFUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (fMRI)\nCocoa contains caffeine, which might interfere with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests. Caffeine can increase the linearity of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal that is used in most fMRI studies (23587).\nless\nNEUROBLASTOMA TESTS\nCocoa, due to its caffeine content, might cause false-positive diagnosis of neuroblastoma, when diagnosis is based on tests of urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) or catecholamine concentrations. Caffeine can increase urine catecholamine and VMA concentrations (15).\nless\nPHARMACOLOGICAL STRESS TESTS\nTaking cocoa might cause false-positive diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, when diagnosis is based on tests of urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) or catecholamine concentrations. Cocoa contains caffeine which is a competitive antagonist for adenosine receptors (11771). Caffeine attenuates the characteristic cardiovascular responses to dipyridamole and has altered test results (11742). It is recommended that caffeine and caffeine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, caffeine appears more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine (Adenocard) stress testing (11771). The interaction between caffeine and dipyridamole is unlikely to be significant in stress testing if the heart rate increase is greater than 5% after dipyridamole infusion (11772).\nless\nPHEOCHROMOCYTOMA TESTS\nTaking cocoa, due to its caffeine content, might cause false-positive diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, when diagnosis is based on tests of urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) or catecholamine concentrations. Cocoa contains caffeine. Caffeine can increase urine catecholamine and VMA concentrations (15).\nless\nPULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS\nTaking cocoa might interfere with pulmonary function test results. Cocoa contains caffeine. People may need to avoid caffeine and caffeinated foods or beverages for at least four hours prior to lung function testing. Forced expiratory volume in one minute (FEV1) seems to show a small improvement up to two hours after caffeine use. Mid-expiratory flow rates may also improve with caffeine for up to four hours (9607).\nless\nURATE\nCocoa contains caffeine. Caffeine causes false elevations in serum urate test results determined by the Bittner method (11844).\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information about the presentation or treatment of overdose with cocoa.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCocoa polyphenols are absorbed from the intestine of animals and humans, with epicatechin absorbed much more than catechin (41936, 41940). Epicatechin levels in the blood increase following consumption of dark chocolate or cocoa (17076, 41996, 42001, 42022, 42026, 42091, 42174, 92273). In humans, the maximum levels of total epicatechin and metabolites after intake of chocolate or cocoa in plasma were reached two hours after either chocolate or cocoa intake (41936, 41948).\n\nDue to the location of the saturated fatty acids in the triglycerides of cocoa butter, the absorption is impaired (42204, 42213).\nMetabolism\nEpicatechin from cocoa is found in plasma as a component of various glucuronide and sulfate conjugates (41936, 41944, 42027, 42078, 42082). Cocoa polyphenols are also metabolized by gut bacteria (42171). Consumption of cocoa polyphenols increases urinary and fecal excretion of phenolic acid; however, excretion can be reduced by incorporating in to gastric-resistant products (42174).\nExcretion\nBoth catechin and epicatechin are excreted in the urine and levels are dependent on dietary intake (41936, 42026, 42027). Theobromine is also excreted in the urine following intake of cocoa products (99981). Conjugated metabolites are also excreted in urine (42027, 42078, 42082, 42123). In human research, consuming cocoa powder resulted in over 27 cocoa phytochemical metabolites in urine, including alkaloid derivatives, polyphenol metabolites derived from metabolism by both gut microbes and the host, and processing-derived diketopiperazines (42085).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of cocoa are the seed, seed coat, cocoa powder, and butter. Cocoa seed contains oils, tannins, and alkaloids, including theobromine 1% to 4%, caffeine 0.07% to 0.36%, trigonelline, and others. Cocoa butter, also referred to as theobroma oil, is the fat obtained from roasted cocoa seeds. It contains oleic acid 37%, stearic acid 34%, palmitic acid 26%, and linoleic acid 2%. Cocoa also contains flavonoids, tyramine, phenylethylamine (PEA), magnesium, and possibly N-acylethanolamines (6018, 6019). The main flavonoids in cocoa are from the flavanol subgroup and include epicatechin and catechin (17077).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn adults with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, consuming 40 grams of dark chocolate containing cocoa reduces tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a marker of inflammation. Researchers theorize that phenolic compounds in cocoa interfere with inflammatory pathways (111531).\nAntibacterial effects\nCocoa bean husk extract may be useful in dental health due to its antibacterial effects on oral bacteria. The extract has been shown to reduce oral bacterial counts and plaque accumulation when used in a mouth rinse by children; possibly related to catechin constituents (41970, 42058, 42138).\nAnticancer effects\nIn overweight or obese individuals, eating dark chocolate containing cocoa for 6 months appears to prevent DNA damage and cellular damage in buccal cells, by a mechanism likely related to the anticancer effects of cocoa polyphenols (99983).\nCardiovascular effects\nCocoa has cardiac stimulant, vasodilatory, and diuretic activity. Theobromine is the major methylxanthine found in cocoa and has only one-tenth of the cardiac activity of caffeine. In healthy young adults, cocoa flavanols 150 mg prevented a decline in flow mediated dilation associated with stress but did not improve stress-induced cardiovascular or blood pressure responses (105256). Also, in one study, consumption of 1.5 grams/kg body weight of chocolate had no acute hemodynamic or physiologic effects on the hearts of healthy, young adults (1373).\n\nPreliminary research suggests that flavanol constituents in cocoa might be beneficial in cardiovascular disease (41943, 41980). Dark chocolate contains higher amounts of these potentially beneficial constituents than milk chocolate or white chocolate (6018). However, the color of the chocolate and the percentage of cocoa present do not provide a measure of the flavanol content. These compounds are bitter and are removed to varying degrees during processing of the cocoa prior to making chocolate (17077).\n\nThere have been recent analyses of the health effects of stearic acid, which is found in substantial amounts in cocoa. Unlike other saturated fatty acids, stearic acid does not increase total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. However, it has been shown that stearic acid can lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and increase lipoprotein(a). Because of this, the stearic acid content in cocoa products is not thought to provide a reduction in the risk for coronary heart disease as was once proposed (6017, 6027). Additionally, preliminary evidence suggests a defatted-cocoa extract might prevent arteries from constricting in the presence of cholesterol. It has been suggested that stearic acid might activate coagulation factor VII and impair fibrinolysis (6027). In contrast, one study concluded that diets high in stearic acid do not increase the tendency toward thrombosis (6020).\nDermatological effects\nCocoa extract is used in skin products, especially for aging, because of the potential for beneficial effects on the skin. In humans, cocoa extracts or constituents appear to improve signs of aging, such as wrinkles, roughness, and elasticity (42006, 91778, 92274). Laboratory research suggests that cocoa polyphenols inhibit the activation of cyclooxygenase-2 and induction of inflammatory mediators in skin models (42003) and dermal blood flow may be increased (42022).\nErgogenic effects\nCocoa is a source of antioxidant flavanols. In human research, eating dark chocolate containing 85% cocoa for one month reduced markers of muscle damage in football players. The antioxidative effects of cocoa were thought to be responsible for this effect (99980).\nGastrointestinal effects\nOne small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking 30 grams of dark chocolate (85% cocoa) daily for 3 weeks increases the diversity and abundance of intestinal bacteria, suggesting that cocoa has prebiotic effects (108900).\nGlycemic effects\nIn a study of healthy volunteers, consuming 100 grams of dark chocolate rich in cocoa polyphenols resulted in decreased insulin resistance and increased insulin sensitivity when compared to consuming white chocolate (14307). Also, consuming cocoa polyphenols prior to an oral glucose tolerance test increased secretion of insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (105257). Most clinical studies do not suggest that cocoa intake improves blood glucose levels (15752, 17187, 42088, 42161, 105257).\nHypotensive effects\nA very low incidence of hypertension has been reported in Kuna Indian groups living off the coast of Panama, who consume large amounts of unprocessed cocoa with a high flavanol content every day. This benefit is lost in those who move to the mainland and consume processed cocoa (17077). These beneficial effects of flavanols are due, at least in part, to antioxidant effects and increased synthesis of nitric oxide (6085, 17076, 17077, 42143). Consuming a cocoa drink containing flavanols and their oligomers, known as procyanidins, can transiently increase nitric oxide activity and reduce endothelial dysfunction (14308, 41965); however, most commercial cocoa drinks contain relatively small amounts of flavanols. Studies measuring the cardiovascular effects of increased cocoa or chocolate intake have found significant improvements in flow-mediated dilatation, a measure of endothelial dysfunction (17187, 42118, 42167, 42173). In a meta-analysis, this was seen with intake of 19-54 grams of cocoa per day or 46-100 grams of dark chocolate per day (17187).\n\nIn a study of healthy volunteers, consuming 100 grams of dark chocolate significantly dilated the brachial artery, perhaps due to epicatechin, but had no effect on the elasticity of the aorta (13161, 42115). In another study of healthy volunteers, consuming 100 grams of dark chocolate rich in cocoa polyphenols resulted in decreased blood pressure compared to consuming white chocolate (14307). However, increasing levels of cocoa flavanols does not appear to decrease blood pressure in normotensive individuals (92271). In a study of healthy Black males, consuming cocoa powder 10 grams daily for 3 weeks decreases systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure when compared with cocoa powder 2 grams or no cocoa powder (109446).\nImmune effects\nThere is some interest in cocoa constituents for their potential immunomodulating effects. Cocoa extract and constituents may alter cellular immunity by regulating the production of inflammatory mediators. Constituents may also alter response of T cells (41981, 42014, 42074, 42086, 42173, 42180).\nLipid effects\nAlthough evidence is mixed as to whether cocoa can reduce cholesterol levels in human research, overall, most clinical evidence suggests that cocoa products do not improve cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic patients (42013, 42026, 42029, 42125, 42225). It is possible that cocoa constituents may protect low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol from undergoing oxidative modification (41939, 41972). Also, the constituent theobromine appears to increase levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol in human research (92270). Although cocoa butter is high in saturated fat, the type of saturated fat, stearic acid, does not appear to increase levels of LDL-cholesterol (41952).\nMood effects\nThere is interest in using cocoa to improve mood. One small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking 30 grams of dark chocolate (85% cocoa) daily for 3 weeks improves negative affect. However, taking dark chocolate with 70% cocoa content does not improve mood. Researchers associated the improvement in mood with an increase in the diversity and abundance of intestinal bacteria, suggesting that cocoa has prebiotic effects (108900). Additionally, phenylethylamine (PEA) found in cocoa is structurally and pharmacologically similar to catecholamines and amphetamine. PEA may be a modulator of mood. N-acylethanolamines are pharmacologically related to anandamide, which activates cannabinoid receptors in the brain (6019, 41976, 42115). Cocoa may also affect mood by decreasing levels of stress hormones including cortisol and catecholamines (42087).\nNeurological effects\nCocoa has CNS stimulant effects. There is preliminary evidence that cocoa flavanols might improve some measures of cognitive function in healthy adults over age 60 with mild memory impairment but no signs of dementia. Suggested mechanisms include increased brain blood flow and perfusion due to vasodilation and reduced endothelial dysfunction, reduced oxidative stress, reduced insulin resistance and improved glycemic control, and effects on intracellular signaling pathways in the brain (18229, 42015, 42063). Increased cerebral blood flow has been shown in middle-aged and older adults given high flavonoid chocolate (92268). The constituent epicatechin is thought to induce angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the brain (42162).\nPlatelet effects\nIn a human trial, patients receiving cocoa powder enriched with flavonoids had decreased epinephrine- or ADP-stimulated expression of fibrinogen-binding glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, indicating that it might inhibit platelet aggregation (6085). Human research suggests that intake of cocoa can inhibit platelet adhesion, aggregation, and activity (6085, 17076, 41928, 41948, 41957, 41958, 41995, 42014, 42070, 42145); however, increasing levels of cocoa flavanols might not inhibit platelet function in healthy individuals (92271). In a study of heart transplant recipients, 40 grams of dark chocolate, containing 70% cocoa, produced coronary vasodilation, improved coronary vasomotion, and decreased platelet adhesion. These changes were correlated with the increase in serum concentrations of the flavanol epicatechin (17076). In human research, cocoa procyanidins beneficially altered synthesis of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory eicosanoid mediators and they affected eicosanoid production from isolated endothelial cells (41935).\nUric acid effects\nIn human research, the theobromine in urine following intake of cocoa products reduced induced uric acid crystallization (99981)."

Based on a review of hospital records in the US, most reactions to coconut are due to oral exposure, including through breastfeeding, with about 50% of reactions associated with anaphylaxis (107673). In addition, there have been numerous case reports of anaphylaxis from coconut in the literature, with most cases presenting in infancy or early childhood (95808, 107674). In one case report, a 12-year-old child with asthma and allergic rhinitis experienced anaphylaxis with difficulty breathing, wheezing and vomiting, from eating a piece of coconut for the first time (95808). In another case report, a 6-year-old child who had previously had urticaria and hives from applying coconut oil experienced throat swelling and anaphylaxis after eating food containing coconut (95806). Coconut may also play a role in cross-sensitization.

However, population research suggests that people who consume large amounts of coconut have higher cholesterol levels when compared with those who do not (26558). These conflicting results may be due to the type of coconut being consumed. For example, coconut contains coconut oil, which has been associated with increased cholesterol levels in some research (12361, 17940).

Coconut oil has been used with apparent safety in children and neonates for about one month (13483, 17937, 90614, 90616, 96204, 101873). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of coconut oil when taken orally in children.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of using coconut oil in medicinal amounts during pregnancy or lactation. Coconut oil ingestion increases the amount of lauric acid in breast milk within 10 hours. This indicates that fatty acids from coconut oil are rapidly transferred into human breast milk following oral intake (14086). The impact of this increase in lauric acid on nursing infants is not known.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and topically, coconut oil is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Increased cholesterol levels.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nAll routes of administration: Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in sensitive individuals.\nCardiovascular\nDue to its high saturated fat content, there has been some speculation that consuming coconut oil might increase cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Several population and clinical studies have found that consuming coconut oil increases total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in some patients (12361, 14407, 17935, 17940, 94451, 94452, 99103, 101877, 101879, 106489, 106494). In patients with normal to high cholesterol levels, consuming a daily diet providing 30% to 36% of calories from fat, of which 46% to 66% is from coconut oil, for 4-12 weeks increases total cholesterol by about 12-15 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 9-12 mg/dL, and HDL cholesterol by 3-6 mg/dL when compared to a diet containing vegetable oils, especially those rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (17935, 94451, 94452, 101877, 106489). In some cases, these cholesterol effects are similar to those seen in patients consuming a similar diet containing butter or beef fat (12361, 17935, 94451, 99103, 101879). Despite the potential effects of coconut oil on cholesterol levels, population research has not found an association with coconut oil consumption and risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or angina (14407, 96205). Advise patients not to rely on coconut oil as a \"healthy\" alternative to other saturated fats.\nless\nDermatologic\nIn one case report, a 6-year-old child developed urticaria and hives from applying coconut oil to the skin. The child had been exposed to coconut oil consistently since 2 weeks of age, indicating sensitization over the course of regular exposure (95806). In clinical research, one patient reported localized pruritus immediately after applying a combination of coconut oil, anise oil, and ylang ylang (13483). It is unclear if this event was due to coconut oil, other ingredients, or the combination. Also, it is possible that this was an idiosyncratic event.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastroenteritis have been reported rarely (101877, 115879).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, taking virgin coconut oil in the diet for 28 days modestly increased levels of liver enzymes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it is unclear if this was due to the coconut oil or to the illness (107664).\nless\nImmunologic\nSeveral cases of allergic reactions have been reported for patients who consumed coconut fruit. In some of the cases, the patients were previously diagnosed with sensitivity to other tree nuts, including peanuts, so cross-sensitivity is suspected. In a separate case report, a 17-year-old male was found to be sensitized to both coconut and buckwheat, indicating a possible cross-sensitivity between the two allergens (95808). In other cases, the patients did not show sensitivity to any other allergens, so the patients were considered to have a single allergy to coconut fruit (12359, 12360).\n\nBecause coconut oil is derived from coconut fruit, ingestion of coconut oil may theoretically cause allergic reactions in patients with confirmed allergy to coconut fruit. In one case report, a 6-year-old child who had previously experienced urticaria and hives from applying coconut oil to the skin experienced throat swelling and anaphylaxis after eating food containing coconut, indicating a sensitivity to both the fruit and the oil via both topical application and ingestion (95806). However, allergic reactions to coconut appear to occur significantly less often than allergies to other food items such as wheat, milk, soy, or peanut (14408).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Topical coconut oil has been evaluated for the management of atopic dermatitis in children, with promising results.\nOne clinical trial in children with atopic dermatitis shows that topical application of virgin coconut oil 5 mL twice daily for 8 weeks results in moderate or excellent improvements in almost two-fold more patients and reduces symptom severity about 30% when compared with mineral oil (90614).\nless\nPrematurity. Topical coconut oil may reduce the risk for hypothermia and apnea and improve body weight, length, and skin integrity in premature infants.\nA large clinical study in premature infants shows that applying coconut oil 5 mL topically four times daily for 28 days reduces the incidence of hypothermia and apnea by 67% and 76%, respectively, when compared with body massage without oil. There were also improvements in the level of vitamin D3 and the overall neurodevelopmental score over 12 months (101873). Clinical studies in premature infants also show that oil massage using coconut oil reduces weight loss in the first few days after birth and improves weight gain and length when compared with mineral oil or no application (17937, 90616, 101873).\n\nPreterm infants are at increased risk for infection due to the inadequate protective barrier provided by immature skin. Clinical studies in preterm or very preterm infants show that topical application of virgin coconut oil 2-4 times daily for 21-28 days as part of routine neonatal care helps maintain skin integrity, but does not reduce the risk for infections such as sepsis, when compared with routine neonatal care alone (96204, 101873). Another clinical study in preterm infants shows that topical application of coconut oil 5 mL/kg twice daily for 28 days reduces the incidence of hospital-acquired infections from 21% to 7% when compared with control, but does not reduce overall mortality (90616).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral coconut oil is beneficial for Alzheimer disease.\nA clinical study in Sri Lankan adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking virgin coconut oil 30 mL daily for 6 months does not improve cognitive assessment scores when compared with control (115881).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral coconut oil is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nA small clinical trial in recreational runners shows that taking virgin coconut oil (Copra Alimentos, Maceio) 15 grams, with or without caffeine 6 mL/kg, 60 minutes prior to a 1600 meter running trial does not improve running performance or ratings of exertion when compared with a warm water control (101874).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral coconut oil is beneficial in patients with breast cancer.\nA small clinical study in patients with invasive or advanced breast cancer shows that taking virgin coconut oil 10 mL twice daily starting one week after chemotherapy from the third to the sixth cycle improves quality of life based on some but not all measurement scales when compared with control (90615).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). Small clinical studies suggest that oral coconut oil does not alter the risk of CHD or prevent cardiovascular events in patients with CHD.\nOne small observational study in India has found that coconut or coconut oil consumption is not associated with a decreased or increased risk of myocardial infarction or angina (14407). A small clinical trial in patients with CHD from India shows that cooking with coconut oil does not alter cardiovascular outcomes or risk factors at 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years when compared with cooking with sunflower oil (96205).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral coconut oil is beneficial for COVID-19.\nA small, open-label clinical study in adults in the Philippines hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 shows that taking virgin coconut oil 45 mL daily for 2 weeks, in addition to standard care, does not reduce hospital length of stay or time to symptom resolution when compared with standard care alone. Additionally, the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality is not reduced (115879). A second clinical study in unvaccinated adults in the Philippines hospitalized with mild to moderate laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 shows that taking virgin coconut oil 0.6 mL/kg on days 1-3 followed by 1.2 mL/kg on days 4-28 does not improve the percentage of patients with relief from COVID-19 symptoms when compared with control (115880).\nless\nCrohn disease. Although there has been interest in using oral coconut oil for Crohn disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of coconut oil for this purpose.\nDental plaque. Small clinical studies suggest that pulling coconut oil through the teeth may modestly reduce dental plaque.\nA small clinical study shows that pulling coconut oil 10 mL through the teeth for 15-20 minutes twice daily for 4 days is as effective as using a mouth rinse containing chlorhexidine gluconate-0.2% as 10 mL twice daily for 30 seconds in the prevention of plaque regrowth in posterior, but not anterior, surfaces of the teeth (101878). Another small clinical study in patients with plaque-induced gingivitis shows that pulling coconut oil 10 mL through the teeth for 5-10 minutes nightly for 30 days improves plaque scores when compared with standard dental hygiene with no mouth rinse (106491).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral coconut oil is beneficial for diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that a single intake of coconut oil as part of a meal modestly increases postprandial glucose levels and decreases insulin levels. However, long-term intake of coconut oil increases insulin resistance, with no effect on fasting blood glucose or insulin levels. Only two studies in these analyses included patients with diabetes (107667). Therefore, the effect of coconut oil in patients with diabetes is unclear.\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral coconut oil is beneficial for improving diarrhea in children.\nOne small clinical study in children with mild-to-moderate dehydration due to diarrhea shows that eating a diet consisting of coconut oil, chicken, and plantain reduces the duration of diarrhea by 20 hours when compared with a cow's milk diet (19269). However, another small clinical trial in children with acute gastroenteritis shows that total duration of diarrhea is no different in children given a milk-free formula containing coconut oil when compared with children given cow's milk formula (19270).\nless\nDry mouth. It is unclear if topical coconut oil is beneficial for improving dry mouth in patients receiving radiation therapy.\nOne small clinical study in patients with dry mouth caused by radiation therapy shows that coating the mouth with coconut oil prior to meals and at bedtime for 2 weeks does not improve dry mouth-related quality of life scores when compared to baseline (106490).\nless\nDry skin. It is unclear if topical coconut oil is beneficial for improving dry skin.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate dry skin shows that applying coconut oil topically twice daily improves skin moisture and skin lipid levels when compared to baseline. Coconut oil seems to be comparable to mineral oil as a skin moisturizer (17936). Also, preliminary clinical research in individuals who apply alcohol-based sanitizers to the hands six times daily shows that applying 6-8 drops (0.1 mL/cm2) of virgin coconut oil to the hands before bed for 15 days modestly increases perceived moisture content, but not perceived appearance or sensation, when compared with not using coconut oil (107668).\nless\nDyslipidemia. Although small clinical studies suggest that oral coconut oil improves some lipid parameters, evidence is mixed.\nA moderate-sized, single-center clinical study in adults in Indonesia with dyslipidemia shows that taking virgin coconut oil 0.6 mL/kg daily on days 1-3 followed by 1.2 mL/kg daily on days 4-30 modestly improves high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) when compared with control (115885). However, a single-center clinical study in India in adults with dyslipidemia shows that adding virgin coconut oil 1000 mg daily to atorvastatin for 8 weeks improves HDL levels by approximately 3 mg/dL when compared with atorvastatin alone. However, LDL and TC were increased in the virgin coconut oil group when compared with atorvastatin alone (115883). Additionally, a small, unblinded, nonrandomized, crossover study in generally healthy adults in Sri Lanka shows that consuming coconut oil daily for 8 weeks, based on individual caloric intake, increases LDL and TC when compared with palm olein oil (115886). The reason for these discrepant findings is unclear, but may be related to differences in dose, duration, and patient populations studied.\nless\nFetal and premature infant mortality. It is unclear if topical coconut oil is beneficial for reducing mortality in premature infants.\nOne clinical study in preterm infants shows that topical application of coconut oil 5 mL/kg twice daily for 28 days reduces the incidence of hospital-acquired infections from 21% to 7% when compared with control, but does not reduce overall mortality (90616).\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if topical coconut oil is beneficial in patients with gingivitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with plaque-induced gingivitis shows that pulling coconut oil 10 mL through the teeth for 5-10 minutes nightly for 30 days improves gingival bleeding scores when compared with standard dental hygiene without a mouth rinse (106491). Another small clinical study in adults with slight gingival inflammation and bleeding shows that massaging coconut oil 15 mL on the gingiva for 10-15 minutes twice daily for 21 days improves inflammation and bleeding when compared to baseline. Additionally, the results with coconut oil are similar when compared with sesame or sunflower oil (115884). Another small clinical study in volunteers with gingival inflammation shows that pulling extra virgin coconut oil, 5 mL, through the teeth for 8 minutes daily for 28 days does not change plaque microbial counts when compared with baseline or with palm oil pulling (110010).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral coconut oil for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of coconut oil for this purpose.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral coconut oil is beneficial in patients with hypertension.\nOne small clinical study in patients with hypertension shows that taking extra virgin coconut oil 3 mL with breakfast, 4 mL with lunch, and 3 mL with dinner daily for 30 days does not reduce blood pressure when compared with placebo (106493).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although there has been interest in using oral coconut oil for IBS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of coconut oil for this purpose.\nLice. Topical coconut oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study in children with head lice shows that application of a topical spray containing coconut oil, anise oil, and ylang ylang oil (Chick-Chack) once every 5 days for three treatments eradicates lice in around 92% of infected children, a rate comparable to children treated with a spray containing permethrin, malathion, piperonyl butoxide, and isododecane (13483). It is unclear if these findings are due to coconut oil, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nLow birth weight. It is unclear if oral coconut oil is beneficial for improving growth in infants with very low birth weight.\nOne small, open-label clinical trial in very low birth weight infants shows that giving coconut oil 1 mL four times daily in expressed breast milk until 40 weeks corrected age does not increase growth when compared with breast milk alone. The addition of coconut oil also has no effect on head circumference, length, weight, or body fat improvements (101875).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral coconut oil is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that using 30 mL of virgin coconut oil in place of other cooking oils daily for 4 weeks reduces levels of triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with a usual diet. However, levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were increased with coconut oil use. Coconut oil did not alter blood pressure or waist circumference (106494).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Oral coconut oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with MS shows that taking coconut oil 60 mL in combination with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 800 mg daily for 4 months improves functional capacity, increases muscle mass, and reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression by a small amount when compared to baseline (101876, 106492). It is unclear if these findings are due to coconut oil, EGCG, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nNipple fissures. It is unclear if topical coconut oil is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of nipple fissures.\nA small clinical study in breastfeeding adults in Turkey shows that applying either coconut oil or tea tree oil to the nipples immediately after breastfeeding on the 3rd, 7th and 10th day postpartum reduces the incidence of nipple fissures and self-reported pain when compared with a control group receiving no treatment (113002). Additionally, preliminary clinical research in breastfeeding primiparous mothers with nipple fissures shows that applying 0.5 mL of virgin coconut oil to the fissures after breastfeeding three times daily for 14 days improves scores on Storr's fissure scale and on a visual analog pain scale, when compared with applying 3 to 4 drops of breastmilk to the nipples after every breastfeeding session (110407).\nless\nNocturnal enuresis. It is unclear if topical coconut oil is beneficial in children with primary nocturnal enuresis.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 6 to 14 years with primary nocturnal enuresis shows that applying coconut oil, 6 drops to the suprapubic, sacral, and flank areas nightly for 4 weeks reduces the mean frequency of urination at 4 weeks and 8 weeks of follow-up, when compared with baseline. Complete resolution occurred in 24 patients receiving coconut oil, and 17 receiving the paraffin oil control. There was no improvement in 5 on coconut oil, and 14 on paraffin oil (110405). However, the validity of these findings is unclear since blinding was compromised by the different oil odors.\nless\nObesity. Although some clinical studies suggest that oral coconut oil may modestly reduce body weight or body mass index (BMI), most research is mixed.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking coconut oil in the diet or as a supplement daily decreases body weight, BMI, and fat mass percent by 0.75 kg, 0.28 kg/m2, and 0.35%, respectively, when compared to other oils and fats, usually polyunsaturated oils. However, there was no effect on waist circumference or total fat mass, and significant changes did not occur in more than half of the individual studies (107665). These individual studies were generally small, of low to moderate quality, and utilized a wide range of dosing regimens. Doses of coconut oil used in the individual studies ranged from 7-93 mL or 14% to 15% of daily energy intake and included extra-virgin, virgin, bleached and deodorized, hydrogenated, and ordinary sources. Study durations ranged from 4 weeks to 2 years (17938, 17942, 99102, 107665). Virgin coconut oil is associated with reduced hunger and desire to eat in normal weight subjects, but not in obese subjects, when compared with extra virgin olive oil. It is also associated with reduced energy intake at the next meal when compared with olive oil in obese subjects, but not in normal weight subjects (110406).\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oil pulling with virgin coconut oil is beneficial for periodontitis.\nA small, unblinded, single-center clinical study in adults with chronic periodontitis receiving ultrasonic scaling shows that rinsing with virgin coconut oil 5 mL twice daily for 4 weeks reduces the amount of plaque and gingival inflammation when compared with baseline (115882). While these improvements appear similar to a group treated with chlorhexidine, statistical analysis between groups is lacking.\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if topical coconut oil is beneficial in patients with psoriasis.\nOne small clinical study in patients with psoriasis shows that applying coconut oil to the skin before treatment with ultraviolet B (UVB) or psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) phototherapy does not seem to improve the clearance of psoriasis (12356).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate coconut oil for these uses.",

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nTopical:\nCoconut oil is most often applied 2-4 times daily as 5 mL rubbed into the skin. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nSome coconut oil products are referred to as \"virgin\" coconut oil. Unlike olive oil, there is no industry standard for the meaning of \"virgin\" coconut oil. Colloquially, the term has come to mean that the oil is generally unprocessed. For example, virgin coconut oil usually has not been bleached, or undergone refinement, or deodorization (90887).\n\nSome coconut oil products claim to be \"cold pressed\" coconut oil. This generally means that a mechanical method of pressing out the oil is used, but without the use of any external heat source (90888).",

In healthy volunteers consuming a capsule containing chlorogenic acid 450 mg, concomitant intake of coconut oil increased absorption to 66%, compared to 6% in those taking chlorogenic acid alone (107666).\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA\nCoconut oil may increase levels of cholesterol and other lipids. Patients with hypercholesterolemia should avoid or use coconut oil in moderation. Several population and clinical studies have found that consuming coconut oil increases total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in some patients (12361, 14407, 17935, 17940, 94451, 94452, 99103, 101877, 101879, 106489, 106494). In clinical research, consuming a daily diet providing 30% to 36% of calories from fat, of which 46% to 66% is from coconut oil, for 4-12 weeks increases total cholesterol by about 12-15 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by about 9-12 mg/dL, and HDL cholesterol by 3-6 mg/dL when compared to a diet containing vegetable oils, especially those rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (17935, 94451, 94452, 106489). In some cases, these cholesterol effects are similar to those seen in patients consuming a similar diet containing butter or beef fat (12361, 17935, 94451, 99103, 101879). Although population research has not found an association with coconut oil consumption and risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or angina (14407, 96205), the American Heart Association states that coconut oil should not be used to manage hypercholesterolemia or reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (94643).\nless",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with coconut oil.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nUnlike triglycerides made up of long-chain fatty acids (dietary fat), most medium chain fatty acids found in coconut oil, such as caprylic acid and capric acid, do not require the intestinal lymphatic system or bile salts for absorption after oral administration (11723, 94453). However, the majority of lauric acid, the main medium-chain fatty acid found in coconut oil, is absorbed with chylomicrons along with long-chain fatty acids (94453).\n\nWhen applied topically, some components of coconut oil appear to be systemically absorbed in preterm infants. Plasma concentrations of monolaurin, a derivative of lauric acid, are elevated in preterm infants after 14 days of twice daily application when compared with preterm infants that did not receive topical coconut oil (103601).\nMetabolism\nMedium-chain fatty acids like caprylic acid and capric acid found in coconut oil undergo rapid metabolism. At physiological pH, medium-chain fatty acids are weak electrolytes and highly ionized, which increases their solubility (11724).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCoconut oil is obtained from the dried nut (fruit) of the coconut palm. About 52% to 85% of coconut oil is made up of medium-chain fatty acids, especially capric acid, caprylic acid, and lauric acid (14407, 17942, 94453, 99104). Lauric acid is the major constituent of the fatty acids. Coconut oil also contains the long-chain saturated fatty acids myristic and palmitic acids. Coconut oil is the most saturated oil compared with palm, soybean, and corn oils; and animal fats such as butter and lard. It contains 76 grams of saturated fatty acids per 100 grams of fat (12357, 12358, 17942). Virgin coconut oil contains antioxidants including vitamin E and polyphenols (107667).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn patients with probable or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), taking virgin coconut oil in the diet for 28 days reduces levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) when compared with placebo (107664). Additionally, clinical research shows that rinsing with virgin coconut oil reduces inflammatory mediator levels in adults with chronic periodontitis (115882).\nAntibacterial effects\nClinical research shows that rinsing with virgin coconut oil reduces bacterial load in adults with chronic periodontitis (115882). Furthermore, monolaurin, a derivative of the coconut oil constituent lauric acid, demonstrates in vitro antimicrobial activity against some gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Candida albicans. Monolaurin does not demonstrate in vitro antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli (103601, 110010). Virgin coconut oil can cause cell membrane destruction in Gram-positive bacteria and lipid-coated viruses (110010).\nAntiviral effects\nClinical research shows that rinsing with virgin coconut oil reduces viral load in adults with chronic periodontitis (115882).\nCardiometabolic effects\nA meta-analysis of 7 studies in patients with various common chronic diseases shows that coconut oil does not significantly reduce body weight, waist circumference, or percentage body fat. It produces a small increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but does not affect the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to HDL cholesterol ratio, triglyceride levels, or total to HDL cholesterol ratio. Coconut oil also does not affect glycemic control (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin), blood glucose regulation (insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function), blood pressure, or subclinical inflammation (110404). However, sample sizes were small, the risk of bias was high, and there was considerable heterogeneity in patient diagnoses, intervention methods and comparators, the doses used and how they were expressed, and duration of follow-up.\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research shows that coconut oil might have an atherogenic effect, possibly by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (12362). However, preliminary clinical research shows that coconut oil lowers postprandial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and lipoprotein (a) levels, which might have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (12363). Also, in animal research virgin coconut oil has beneficial effects on the lipid profile and lipid peroxidation (99106).\n\nAlthough some conflicting evidence exists (17938, 17940, 17942, 99103), most research shows that dietary coconut oil can increase levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol more than a diet rich in unsaturated fats and similarly to a diet rich in other saturated fats such as beef fat or butter (17935, 94451, 94452, 94453, 106489). Coconut oil contains lauric acid, myristic and palmitic acids, which are all positively associated with serum cholesterol concentrations (94451). The cholesterol-raising potential of the long-chain saturated fatty acids palmitic acid and myristic acid are greater than that of the medium-chain saturated fatty acid lauric acid (94451).\nHepatoprotective effects\nThere is some interest in coconut oil for protection against hepatotoxicity. Preliminary research in animal models shows that dietary intake of coconut oil helps prevent experimentally induced hepatotoxicity (17939). Animal research also found that dietary intake of virgin coconut oil can reverse experimentally-induced hepatic steatosis by normalizing lipid and glucose metabolism and having antioxidant effects. The medium chain fats in virgin coconut oil are thought to be responsible for these beneficial effects, since heated coconut oil was not as effective (99104). In normal rats, virgin coconut oil improves the hepatic antioxidant defense system and liver enzymes (99106).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using coconut oil for weight and fat loss. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking coconut oil 10 mL orally three times daily can reduce waist circumference in men and women with abdominal obesity (17938, 17942). In some individuals, taking coconut oil with a reduced calorie diet can also reduce weight or body mass index (17938, 17942, 99102). Coconut oil, particularly virgin coconut oil, is thought to help reduce fat accumulation, increase satiety, and reduce food intake compared to some other dietary fats because it contains a higher proportion of medium-chain fatty acids and a lower proportion of long-chain fatty acids. Medium-chain fatty acids are not stored in adipose tissues like long-chain fatty acids (17942, 96206, 99105). Preliminary clinical research in women with excess body fat found that virgin coconut oil reduces appetite and increases satiety, without affecting the resting energy expenditure, fat oxidation rate, or diet induced thermogenesis (99105). Other preliminary clinical research found that medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil consumption reduces food intake and increases feelings of fullness compared to coconut oil or vegetable oil. Coconut oil also reduces food intake compared to vegetable oil, but to a lesser degree than MCT oil, and with no effect on feelings of fullness (96206). This finding supports the theory that the weight loss effects of coconut oil may be related to its proportion of medium-chain fatty acid content."

After delivery, the full-term neonate experienced seizures, and severe hyponatremia (113 mEq/L) was identified. The infant required treatment with infusions of 3% hypertonic sodium chloride along with 10% dextrose in normal saline (115939).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nWhen consumed as a rehydration beverage following exercise, some people experience fullness or stomach upset (17678, 95126). However, gastrointestinal distress is not reported in all studies (95139). Also, in some cases it appears to occur at a lower rate when compared with drinking plain water or drinking a carbohydrate-electrolyte rehydration fluid (17678).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nIn one case report, a 69-year-old male died within approximately 30 hours of consuming a small amount of coconut water that was found to contain 3-nitropropionic acid due to spoilage with Arthrinium saccharicola. About 3 hours after consumption, the patient developed sweating, nausea, and vomiting, and was in a state of reduced consciousness when presenting to the hospital about 1.5 hours later. Other symptoms included confusion, dystonia, and poor balance, as well as metabolic acidosis. The coconut was pre-shaved and although refrigeration was recommended, it had been stored at room temperature for approximately one month after purchase (107670).\nless",

Topical coconut water has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn individuals with self-perceived hair loss, preliminary clinical research shows that applying a combination leave-in product containing coconut water modestly improves hair growth rate and density, and reduces hair thinning when compared with baseline. The product contained coconut water solids (Cococin), Indian gooseberry (Saberry), gamma-L-glutamyl-selenomethionine (Peptiselect), and other ingredients; a once daily application of 3.5 mL in females and 2 mL in males was used for 3 months (105353).\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral coconut water is beneficial for athletic performance.\nPreliminary clinical research in males shows that drinking coconut water 10 mL/kg of body mass, taken in seven divided doses every 10 minutes prior to exercise in the heat, increases cycling time to exhaustion by about 2 seconds when compared with drinking plain water (95139). In contrast, a small crossover study in experienced cyclists shows that drinking coconut water 2.5 mL/kg of body mass every 15 minutes for 1.5 hours prior to a cycling time trial does not improve time trial performance when compared with a commercial sports drink (115938).\n\nOther clinical research shows that drinking coconut water equivalent to 125% of estimated bodily fluid loss over a period of one hour following exercise-induced dehydration improves subsequent treadmill performance to a similar extent as a sports drink containing carbohydrates and electrolytes (95126). However, drinking coconut water during or following exercise may not be any more effective than drinking plain water (95126, 95136).\nless\nDiarrhea-related dehydration. It is unclear if oral coconut water is beneficial for diarrhea-related dehydration.\nPreliminary reports suggest that drinking coconut water might improve hydration in children with mild diarrhea (17666). But there is no reliable evidence that it is any more effective than other beverages for this purpose.\nless\nExercise-induced dehydration. It is unclear if oral coconut water is beneficial for exercise-related dehydration.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that drinking coconut water following exercise is effective for rehydration. It appears to be comparable to sports drinks containing carbohydrates and electrolytes, especially if the coconut water is enriched in sodium (17678, 17679, 95126, 95136). However, coconut water may not be any more effective than drinking plain water (17678). Coconut water equivalent to 120% to 125% of estimated bodily fluid loss has been consumed over a period of 1-2 hours following exercise (17678, 17679, 95126). Alternatively, 1 liter of coconut water consumed in 4 divided doses has been used during 60 minutes of exercise (95136).\n\nDrinking coconut water before exercise might help prevent dehydration from occurring. A small clinical study shows that drinking coconut water 10 mL/kg of body mass, taken in seven divided doses every 10 minutes before exercising in the heat, reduces urine output after exercise without affecting sweat rate when compared with plain water. This suggests that coconut water may have a greater hydration capacity than plain water (95139). However, additional research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral coconut water is beneficial for hypertension.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with hypertension shows that drinking coconut water 300 mL twice daily for up to 2 weeks modestly lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with baseline (17680). Any effects of coconut water on blood pressure may be due to its potassium content. Potassium concentrations range from 35-82 mEq/L (17669, 95138).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral coconut water is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nA single-center clinical study conducted in India in adults with ulcerative colitis, with most having mild disease, shows that drinking 400 mL of coconut water daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard care is associated with 2.9- and 3.4-fold increased odds of achieving clinical remission and response, respectively, when compared with placebo. However, the odds of endoscopically confirmed remission and response are not improved (115937).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of coconut water.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCoconut water is the clear liquid found inside green immature coconuts. As the coconut matures, this water declines and is replaced by coconut meat. Immature coconuts contain from 500-1000 mL of fluid (17669). Coconut water is different than coconut milk. Coconut milk is produced from an emulsion of the grated meat and water of a mature coconut (17669). Coconut water has a pH ranging from 4.2-6. Sodium concentrations in commercial coconut water can range from 0.7-46.3 mEq/L; however, most coconut water contains about 5-10 mEq/L of sodium (17679). Potassium concentrations range from 35-82 mEq/L. Chloride concentrations range from 21-63 mEq/L. Glucose concentrations range from 1.2-2.8 grams/L. Calcium concentrations range from 5-17 mEq/L. Magnesium concentrations range from 5-25 mEq/L (17669, 95137, 95138). Coconut water also contains flavonoids, anthocyanins, benzaldehydes, amino acids, and phenolic acids (110701).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nIn animal diabetes models, coconut water seems to reduce levels of blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin and increase levels of insulin (107671, 107672). Also, coconut water might reduce levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (107671) and protect against retinal and renal damage (107669, 107672). The protective effects of coconut water might be related to its ability to reduce overall oxidative stress, as well as levels of some inflammatory cytokines in the retina (107669, 107672).\nDiuretic effects\nCoconut water appears to have acute and prolonged diuretic effects similar to furosemide when compared with normal saline. The suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), enhancement of atriopeptin levels, and reduction in aquaporin gene expression and protein levels are possible explanations for coconut water's diuretic effects (110701).\nElectrolyte effects\nCoconut water is often used as a healthy drink due to its nutrient content, which includes glucose and electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium (95137). Because of the electrolyte content of coconut water, it is often used as a rehydrating solution in people who are dehydrated due to physical activity or illness such as diarrhea. However, the amount of electrolytes in coconut water varies substantially throughout maturation. Some analyses suggest that the electrolyte composition in coconut water is not adequate for it to be used as an oral rehydration solution (17667, 17668, 95138). Research in rat models suggests that high-concentration coconut water may increase the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and potassium ions, and enhance sodium-potassium pump activity (110701).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn human research, coconut water alters the gut microbiome, reducing levels of harmful bacteria and increasing beneficial bacteria (115937)."

However, the cod liver oil that was commercially available in the 1990s in Norway contained high levels of vitamin A (1000 mcg per 5 mL; equivalent to 3333 units of retinol). It is thought that accumulation of vitamin A in the lungs contributed to the development of asthma.\n\nA case report describes a 63-year-old white woman with a history of smoking and polyarthropathy who underwent a lobectomy after identification of a mass in her lung.

However, since dietary fish intake is relatively high in this population, additional cod liver oil supplementation may not have been beneficial.\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral cod liver oil during pregnancy prevents allergic rhinitis in the child. In addition, it is unclear if oral cod liver oil during childhood prevents allergic rhinitis.\nPopulation research from Norway found that taking cod liver oil at least once weekly during pregnancy or breast-feeding is not associated with a reduced risk of allergic rhinitis in the child. Also, consumption of cod liver oil at least once weekly at 2 years of age is not associated with a reduced risk of allergic rhinitis at age 6 years (101989). Since the participants in this study normally consumed high amounts of oily fish and cod liver oil, it is unclear if cod liver oil would be beneficial in populations with normally low intake.\nless\nArrhythmia.

Approximately 44% of patients treated with cod liver oil achieved a clinically relevant reduction in VPCs, compared to only 15% taking placebo (7360). However, it is not clear if this reduction in VPCs correlates with a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular-related mortality. Other clinical research shows that taking cod liver oil 20 mL orally daily for 6 weeks does not reduce the number of ventricular extrasystoles or other arrhythmias in men with arrhythmias following myocardial infarction (MI) (94759).\nless\nAsthma.

It is unclear if oral cod liver oil is beneficial in gestational or type 1 diabetes.\nIn women with gestational diabetes, clinical research shows that taking cod liver oil 500 mg daily for 4 weeks, starting at 24-28 weeks gestation, does not improve levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, or plasma lipids when compared with placebo. However, taking cod liver oil for 12-16 weeks reduces HbA1c by 8.4%, fasting blood glucose by 41%, and insulin resistance by 43%, when compared with baseline. These differences were statistically significant when compared with placebo. Taking cod liver oil also resulted in a 17.5% reduction in perinatal complications, especially postpartum infections and Caesarian section (101988).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with type 1 diabetes and elevated cholesterol levels shows that taking cod liver oil (Eskisol emulsion, Pharma-Vinci A/s) 21 mL orally daily for 8 weeks does not lower total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol levels, or affect insulin requirement, HbA1c, or blood glucose levels.

It is unclear if oral cod liver oil is beneficial for lowering lipid levels; the available research is conflicting.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking cod liver oil (Eskisol emulsion, Pharma-Vinci A/s) 21 mL orally daily for 8 weeks does not lower total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with type 1 diabetes and elevated cholesterol levels. However, it appears to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 5 mg/dL when compared to baseline (3399). Other clinical research in men with a history of myocardial infarction shows that taking an Icelandic cod liver oil 20 mL orally daily for 6 weeks appears to decrease triglycerides by 18 mg/dL when compared to baseline, with no improvement in LDL cholesterol levels (94758).\n\nA large, single-blind clinical study of patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking oral cod liver oil 415 mg daily in conjunction with oral rosuvastatin 10 mg daily for 30 days further reduces total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels when compared with rosuvastatin monotherapy (107491). It is unclear if this effect is due to cod liver oil, rosuvastatin, or the combination.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral cod liver oil is beneficial for lowering blood pressure.\nIn adults with type 1 diabetes, albuminuria, and mild hypertension, taking cod liver oil (Eskisol emulsion, Pharma-Vinci A/s) 21 mL orally daily for 8 weeks can reduce systolic blood pressure by 7 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg when compared to baseline (3399). A small clinical study in healthy men shows that taking cod liver oil (British Cod Liver Oils, Hull, UK) 5 mL orally four times daily with meals for 6 weeks can reduce systolic blood pressure by 13 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 12 mmHg when compared to baseline (4026). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator groups.\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral cod liver oil is beneficial for lowering triglyceride levels.\nClinical research in men with a history of myocardial infarction shows that taking cod liver oil 20 mL orally daily for 6 weeks appears to decrease triglycerides by 18 mg/dL when compared to baseline, with no improvement in LDL cholesterol levels (94758). The clinical significance of these changes in patients with hypertriglyceridemia are unclear.\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is unclear if oral cod liver oil is beneficial in IBD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking cod liver oil (Möller Axellus AS) 10 mL orally three times daily before meals for 14 days reduces joint pain intensity in adults with arthralgias associated with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis when compared to baseline (94754). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMeasles. Although there has been interest in using cod liver oil as a source of Vitamin A for measles prevention or treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cod liver oil for this condition. Review our vitamin A monograph for details regarding the role of vitamin A deficiency and supplementation in measles.\nMyocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if oral cod liver oil is beneficial for preventing MI.\nA large, non-blinded clinical study in patients at moderate to high risk for a cardiovascular event shows that taking oral cod liver oil 415 mg daily for up to 12 months does not affect the overall incidence of MI or the incidence of fatal or non-fatal MI when compared with no supplementation (107490). It is unclear if cod liver oil supplementation has any effect on modifiable risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesteremia, which may impact the long-term incidence of MI.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral cod liver oil is beneficial when used with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking cod liver oil 10 mL orally daily for 24 weeks, in combination with NSAIDs, does not decrease pain or inflammation when compared with NSAID treatment alone (3398).\nless\nOtitis media. It is unclear if oral cod liver oil prevents otitis media in children.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking cod liver oil 5 mL orally daily, in combination with a children's multivitamin-mineral preparation containing selenium, can reduce the number of days of antibiotic therapy in an otitis media (OM) season in young children aged 0.8-4.4 years. The mean percentage of days on antibiotics in the OM season decreased by 12% when compared with the previous year's OM season, when no supplements were used (10151).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral cod liver oil prevents respiratory tract infections.\nA large clinical trial in adults shows that taking cod liver oil 5 mL daily for up to 6 months in winter does not prevent acute respiratory infections compared with placebo. Each 5 mL of cod liver oil provided vitamin D3 400 IU, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0.4 grams, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 0.5 grams (110378). However, preliminary clinical research shows that giving children a specific cod liver oil product (Carlson for Kids cod liver oil lemon flavor, Carlson Labs) along with a multivitamin (Carlson for Kids Scooter Rabbit Chewable Vitamins and Minerals, Carlson Labs) for about 5 months decreases the number of doctor's office visits for respiratory tract infections when compared with no supplementation. Children aged 1-5 years received 1 teaspoon of cod liver oil and half a multivitamin tablet daily; children aged 0.5-1 year received half doses (94756).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral cod liver oil is beneficial in RA.\nA preliminary, uncontrolled study suggests that taking a specific cod liver oil product (Seven Seas Neutrataste, Seven Seas Ltd.) 1 gram daily for 3 months might decrease pain, morning stiffness, and swelling in people with symptoms suggestive of RA who have not received any prior treatment (94757). Other clinical research shows that taking cod liver oil and fish oil (Seven Seas Marine Oil, Seven Seas Ltd.) 10 grams daily for 36 weeks can reduce NSAID use in patients with RA. About 4-fold more patients taking cod liver oil and fish oil can reduce NSAID intake by at least 30% when compared with placebo (65855). It is unclear if this effect is due to cod liver oil, fish oil, or the combination.\nless\nVitamin D deficiency. It is unclear if oral cod liver oil is beneficial as a vitamin D supplement.\nCod liver oil is sometimes used as a source of vitamin D. Evidence from population research shows that increased daily intake of cod liver oil supplements is associated with higher serum levels of vitamin D (94760). Also, a population study of postmenopausal women in northern Scotland shows that those taking a daily cod liver oil supplement are less likely to be vitamin D deficient during the winter and spring than those not taking a supplement (94761). However, preliminary clinical research shows that taking a low dose of cod liver oil (Möller Axellus AS) orally to provide 200 IU of vitamin D daily for 8 weeks during the winter does not maintain serum vitamin D at typical summer levels (94755).\nless\nWound healing. Although there has been interest in using topical cod liver oil for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cod liver oil for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate cod liver oil for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nCod liver oil products sold as dietary supplements in the US are not standardized and vary considerably in fat-soluble vitamin content and purity, leading to concerns about vitamin toxicity (94765). Vitamin D toxicity, presenting with hypercalcemia and acute renal failure, has been reported after taking a specific cod liver oil product (Merluzzovis, Dr.Giorgini) for at least 6 months. The product was labeled as containing 1.5 mcg of vitamin D per capsule, but the measured content was actually around 1.3 mg, an almost 1000-fold difference (94766).\n\nCod liver oil products complying with USP standards can contain up to 11,250 IU of vitamin A per 5 mL. At this level, a daily dose of 5 mL would provide more than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 10,000 IU vitamin A for adults (7135). Prior to 1999, cod liver oil from Norway contained higher quantities of vitamin A. Due to concerns about the effect of high vitamin A intake on bone mineral density and fracture risk, the level was gradually reduced between 1999 and 2002 (94752). Around 2002, levels of vitamin A and vitamin D were also decreased significantly in Icelandic cod liver oils (94760).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with cod liver oil.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAbsorption of omega-3 fatty acids from an emulsified cod liver oil is greater than from a non-emulsified oil source, resulting in plasma omega-3 fatty acid levels up to twice as high in the 10 hours following the dose. Furthermore, maximal levels of omega-3 fatty acids occurred up to 2 hours faster (101990).\nDistribution\nOmega-3 fatty acids from cod liver oil taken orally are distributed to the plasma and breast milk (94763, 94764, 94768, 101990). Plasma concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids are higher after intake of emulsified, compared with a non-emulsified form, of cod liver oil (101990). Also, in one study, taking Norwegian cod liver oil 10 mL, containing 2.6 grams of total omega-3 fatty acids, orally daily from week 18 of pregnancy and continuing during lactation increased total omega-3 levels in maternal plasma from 129.9 mg/L at week 18 of pregnancy to 218.2 mg/L at week 35. At 4 weeks after delivery, total omega-3 fatty acids in breast milk constituted 3.35% by weight, compared with 1.83% in women taking placebo (corn oil) (94763). In another study in lactating women, taking 2.5 mL, 5 mL, or 10 mL of cod liver oil daily for 14 days increased plasma total omega-3 fatty acid levels in a dose-related manner, and there was a significant correlation between maternal plasma levels and levels in the milk. Taking 10 mL daily increased milk levels of omega-3 fatty acids from a median of 1.85% by weight to 3.24% by weight (94768).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCod liver oil contains the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), which are metabolized in the body to less potent triggers of inflammatory and immunological reactions than the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids typically found in the Western diet (94754, 94765, 101988). Epidemiological studies in Greenland Eskimos suggest that a high intake of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a lower incidence of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (65855). Cod liver oil also contains vitamins A, D, and E (4004, 4026).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe omega-3 fatty acid EPA found in cod liver oil competitively inhibits conversion of arachidonic acid to inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and is a precursor of the less inflammatory 3-series prostaglandins and 5-series leukotrienes (4026, 10080, 65855, 94754).\n\nThere is interest in using cod liver oil to reduce exercise-induced inflammation. An observational study surveyed recreational athletes about their habitual use of cod liver oil and other omega-3 fatty acid supplements. The regular consumption of cod liver oil is associated with lower basal and exercise-induced C-reactive protein levels 24 hours prior to and 24 hours following a 91-kilometer bicycle race when compared with no or occasional use of cod liver oil, or use of other omega-3 fatty acid supplements. However, there is no association between post-race creatine kinase levels and types of supplementation (e.g. occasional or regular use of cod liver oil or other omega-3 fatty acid supplements) (107492).\nHematologic effects\nSeveral small studies from the 1980s, conducted primarily in healthy volunteers, suggest that taking cod liver oil 20-40 mL daily in divided doses for 2-6 weeks can prolong bleeding time up to 81%, reduce platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, ADP, or collagen, and decrease thrombin-stimulated thromboxane B2 production in platelets (4026, 10080, 10083, 91701, 91702). These changes are associated with increases in the levels of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in platelet and erythrocyte membrane phospholipids, at the expense of omega-6 fatty acids (4026, 10083, 91701, 91702). Taking cod liver oil 25 mL daily for 8 weeks is also associated with a decrease in synthesis of the enzyme thromboplastin which catalyzes conversion of prothrombin to thrombin in the coagulation cascade (10080). Whether clinically significant changes in platelet aggregation and bleeding times occur with cod liver oil products currently on the market is unclear."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of codonopsis.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of codonopsis is the root. The roots contain phenylpropanoids, polyacetylenes, triterpenoids, and alkaloids (43879, 100061, 100062).\nAnti-cancer effects\nCodonopsis is traditionally used for cancer. In vitro, codonopsis extract has been shown to inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of various cancer cell lines. The potentially active constituents include some triterpenoid constituents, especially lancemaside A, as well as the phenylpropanoid cordifoliketone A (43883, 100061, 100062). However, some evidence suggests that codonopsis might promote prostate cancer tumor growth. A subcutaneous mouse model of prostate cancer suggests that administering codonopsis root increases tumor size, up-regulates androgen receptor mRNA, and increases androgen receptor protein expression when compared with control (105912).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nA study in mice with gut inflammation and damage induced by cyclophosphamide suggests that administering codonopsis root fructan 50-200 mg/kg daily for 7 days reduces inflammatory cytokines in the small intestine when compared with mice not given codonopsis root fructan (110742).\nEndocrine effects\nIn laboratory research, codonopsis root extract inhibits mammalian alpha-glucosidase (110743). In mice with induced diabetes, administering codonopsis root extract 200-400 mg/kg reduces postprandial blood glucose, but to a lesser extent than acarbose (110743). Another study in mice fed a high-fat diet suggests that administering codonopsis oligosaccharides 500 mg/kg daily for 16 weeks attenuates glucose intolerance when compared with mice not given codonopsis (110741).\nGastrointestinal effects\nCodonopsis is traditionally used for dyspepsia. In animal research, codonopsis reduced gastric acid secretion and gastrointestinal movement (43892).\nImmunological effects\nCodonopsis is used in traditional Chinese medicine to support the spleen and replenish chi, which suggests immunostimulant effects (103738). In laboratory research, codonopsis stimulates macrophage activity and white blood cell counts (11). In mice, depending on the length of exposure, codonopsis both reduced and stimulated immunological responses to triggers (43893). In other studies in mice that were immunosuppressed by intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide administration, codonopsis oligosaccharides or root fructan given orally increased production of phagocytes, lymphocytes, and immunoglobulins. This suggests that codonopsis has immune stimulating effects (103738, 110742).\nRenal effects\nThere is interest in codonopsis for the regulation of electrolyte homeostasis via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). In animal models, adding aqueous codonopsis root extract to the daily acidified water supply increased water consumption and potassium levels and reduced aldosterone levels and angiotensin II receptor (AT1R) transcription when compared with drinking regular acidified water (105911).\nWeight effects\nA study in mice fed a high-fat diet suggests that administering codonopsis oligosaccharides 500 mg/kg daily for 16 weeks attenuates weight gain and fat accumulation when compared with mice not given codonopsis (110741)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nCoenzyme Q10 deficiency. Taking coenzyme Q10 orally improves symptomatic deficiency.\nRare cases of acquired coenzyme Q10 deficiency with symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and seizures have been reported (8160, 8161). In adults, deficiency can be treated with coenzyme Q10 orally, 150-2400 mg daily in up to three divided doses. In children, 30 mg/kg, or 60-250 mg daily in up to three divided doses has been used (8160, 8161, 89417).\n\nData from several multinational disease registries has also evaluated the use of coenzyme Q10 in patients with primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency, a rare genetic disorder. This data indicates that patients who take coenzyme Q10 supplements have a mean reduction of 88% in proteinuria at 12 months when compared with patients who do not take coenzyme Q10. In patients under 18 years of age with primary deficiency and chronic kidney disease at baseline, taking coenzyme Q10 supplements is associated with a 5-year survival without kidney failure of 62%, compared with 19% for those not taking coenzyme Q10 (108956).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). Oral coenzyme Q10 may provide benefit to patients with CHF by improving some, but not all, measures of disease severity when given in combination with conventional therapy.\nPopulation research has found that CHF is associated with low coenzyme Q10 levels that correlate with severity of disease, and may be a predictor of mortality risk (44059, 44220). Meta-analyses of lower-to-moderate quality clinical studies in adults with heart failure, mostly heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, show that taking coenzyme Q10 30-400 mg daily reduces the relative risk of mortality and hospitalization, and modestly improves exercise capacity when compared with control and placebo. The validity of these results is limited by the heterogenous methods across clinical studies including heart failure classification, dose, duration, concurrent therapy, variable measures of treatment effect, and short follow-up (108954, 115943, 115946). Other clinical research shows that adding oral coenzyme Q10 seems to improve quality of life and decrease symptoms of CHF such as dyspnea, peripheral edema, enlarged liver, and insomnia in patients with mild to severe (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV) CHF (6037, 6038, 6407, 6408, 6409, 8909, 12170, 43967, 43971, 44042)(44277, 44288, 44289, 44304, 44334, 44352, 96542). Additional clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 30 mg daily for 1 year in addition to standard care reduces the incidence of atrial fibrillation by about 73% when compared with standard care alone in patients with NYHA class II-IV CHF (95609).\n\nHowever, not all evidence is positive. Some research suggests that coenzyme Q10 does not improve objective measures of CHF, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output, or NYHA classification (5090, 5248, 6037, 6038, 43904, 43932, 96542, 97902). It is possible that the benefit of coenzyme Q10 depends on the dose and duration, the severity of CHF, and the specific conventional therapies taken concurrently (43973).\n\nIn patients with CHF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and LVEF of 50% or greater, taking coenzyme Q10 600 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces B-type natriuretic peptide levels and improves Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores, level of vigor, and LVEF when compared with placebo (108959).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. When taken alone or as add-on treatment with pregabalin, most research suggests that oral coenzyme Q10 reduces symptoms in patients with diabetes and neuropathy.\nClinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 400 mg orally daily for 12 weeks significantly improves nerve conduction and symptoms of neuropathic pain when compared with placebo in diabetic patients with polyneuropathy (44217). The beneficial effects of coenzyme Q10 have also been investigated as an add-on treatment in patients taking pregabalin 150 mg daily. Clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100 mg three times daily for 8 weeks reduces pain severity and sleep interference due to pain when compared with placebo. The proportion of patients taking coenzyme Q10 with a decline in pain of at least 50% was 47%, compared with 27% of those taking placebo. Despite these findings, there was no difference in patient global improvement (109391).\n\nHowever, some research disagrees. One clinical trial shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (Health Burst) 200 mg daily for 12 weeks does not affect neuropathic symptoms, including pain, sensations, and strength, when compared with placebo (109386).\nless\nFibromyalgia. Oral coenzyme Q10 seems to improve both physical and psychological symptoms of this condition.\nClinical research in women with fibromyalgia shows that taking coenzyme Q10 300-400 mg orally daily for 40 days to 3 months improves pain by 24% to 56%, fatigue by 22% to 47%, sleep disturbances by 33%, morning tiredness by 56%, and tender points by 44% when compared with placebo. Patients also experience an improvement in psychological symptoms, including depression and anxiety (89416, 97912, 97913).\nless\nIschemia-reperfusion injury. Oral or intravenous coenzyme Q10 may help reduce hypoxic damage during cardiac bypass or vascular surgery.\nClinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10, 150-300 mg orally daily in up to 3 divided doses for 1-2 weeks before cardiac bypass or vascular surgery, or 5 mg/kg IV two hours prior to surgery, reduces hypoxic damage during the surgery (11902, 11903, 44031, 44294). However, coenzyme Q10 has no effect on cardiac function or troponin levels (11904, 44292).\nless\nMigraine headache. The American Academy of Neurology considers oral coenzyme Q10 to be possibly effective for migraine prevention in adults. Its benefit in children is unclear.\nMeta-analyses of small clinical studies in adults show that coenzyme Q10 reduces migraine frequency and severity (105070, 115730). For example, a meta-analysis of 6 small clinical trials in adults shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100-400 mg daily reduces the average number of migraine attacks by 1.7 per month, reduces duration of migraines by approximately 1.7 hours, and modestly reduces severity when compared with placebo. Furthermore, reductions in migraine frequency, duration, and severity are dose-dependent (115730). The validity of these results is limited by heterogeneity across clinical studies.\n\nData from small open-label, non-randomized clinical trials in adults show it can take up to 3 months to see benefit of coenzyme Q10 in reducing frequency of migraine headache (8135, 95608).\n\nIn children and adolescents, some clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 orally, as 100 mg daily or 1-3 mg/kg daily, for 12-16 weeks does not improve headache frequency, severity, or duration when compared with placebo. However, it may reduce migraine frequency in children with low coenzyme Q10 levels (15256, 44197). However, another clinical study shows that taking coenzyme Q10 daily is less effective than amitriptyline after one month, but as effective after 3 months, for improving headache frequency, severity, or duration, as well as quality of life. In this study, the dose of coenzyme Q10 was based on weight; 30 mg daily for children weighing less than 30 kg and 60 mg daily for children weighing at least 30 kg (109388).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Oral coenzyme Q10 seems to reduce fatigue and depression associated with MS.\nClinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 500 mg orally daily for 3 months reduces fatigue and depression in patients with MS when compared with placebo (96539).\nless\nMuscular dystrophy. Oral coenzyme Q10 seems to improve physical performance in patients with muscular dystrophy of various forms.\nTwo small clinical studies show that taking coenzyme Q10 orally 100 mg daily for 3 months seems to improve physical performance when compared with placebo in some patients with various muscular dystrophies (2127).\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). Oral coenzyme Q10 seems to reduce cardiac events and improve survival in patients who have had an MI. It is unclear if coenzyme Q10 improves survival in patients after cardiac arrest.\nOne small clinical study in patients with acute MI shows that starting coenzyme Q10 60 mg twice daily within 72 hours of the MI appears to significantly reduce the risk of cardiac events, including non-fatal MI and cardiac death, by 52% when administered for 28 days and by 45% when administered for up to one year (10152, 44330). Also, a small clinical study in patients with recent MI who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, shows that administering a 250 mg loading dose of coenzyme Q10 solution followed by 150 mg three times daily through a nasogastric tube for 5 days improves the 3-month survival rate by 134% when compared with placebo (43935). However, another clinical study in a similar patient population conducted to replicate these results shows that administering coenzyme Q10 300 mg in 50 mL of Ensure every 12 hours for 7 days does not improve in-hospital mortality or neurological outcomes when compared with placebo (105068).\nless\nPeyronie disease. Coenzyme Q10 taken orally may reduce Peyronie disease severity.\nClinical research shows that, in patients with early chronic Peyronie disease, taking coenzyme Q10 (Kaneka Nutrients, Osaka) 300 mg orally daily for 24 weeks reduces new plaque formation and plaque size and improves erectile function when compared with placebo. Additionally, disease progression is slowed in about 76% of patients (44180).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAlzheimer disease. Coenzyme Q10 appears to be ineffective for improving cognition.\nOne clinical study shows that taking coenzyme Q10 1200 mg orally daily for 16 weeks does not improve cognition scores when compared with placebo in patients with Alzheimer disease (19206).\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Oral coenzyme Q10 does not attenuate functional decline in ALS patients.\nClinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 2700 mg orally daily for 9 months does not significantly attenuate a decline in ALS functioning scores when compared with placebo (44131). Higher doses, up to 3000 mg daily, have been tolerated by patients with ALS for 5 months, although the effect on ALS functioning at this dose is not known (43955).\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. Oral coenzyme Q10 does not seem to help with fatigue due to chemotherapy.\nClinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100 mg orally three times daily for 24 weeks does not reduce chemotherapy-related fatigue or improve quality of life when compared with placebo in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with or without radiation (89420).\nless\nDiabetes. Most clinical research does not show any benefit with oral coenzyme Q10 in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, some research suggests a possible benefit on insulin resistance.\nAlthough a recent meta-analysis and some individual clinical research shows that coenzyme Q10 modestly reduces fasting glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, most clinical research shows that coenzyme Q10 has no clinically meaningful effect on these parameters (456, 492, 2126, 9890, 11877, 17704, 44023, 96544, 97911, 97918)(99636, 103778, 109389). However, a recent meta-analysis in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes shows that improvements in insulin resistance may be clinically meaningful when compared with placebo (109389). In people with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy requiring hemodialysis, coenzyme Q10 120 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve blood glucose levels, HbA1c, or lipid levels when compared with placebo, although it is associated with a decrease in serum insulin levels and insulin resistance (99636).\nless\nParkinson disease. Most clinical research does not show any benefit with the use of oral coenzyme Q10 in patients with Parkinson disease.\nWhile some conflicting evidence exists (8938, 15255), a large clinical trial and a meta-analysis of 8 small clinical studies in patients with Parkinson disease show that taking coenzyme Q10 300-2400 mg daily for up to 2 years does not improve Parkinson disease symptoms at any stage of the disease, or slow progression of the disease, when compared with placebo (89421, 95610). In addition, a clinical study in patients with mid-stage Parkinson disease shows that taking a specific nanoparticulate coenzyme Q10 supplement (Nanoquinon, MSE Pharmazeutilka) 100 mg orally three times daily does not reduce symptoms when compared with placebo (15395).\nless\nPost-polio syndrome. Muscle function in people with post-polio syndrome is not improved by oral coenzyme Q10.\nClinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve muscle strength when compared with baseline, nor does it improve muscle function or muscle endurance when compared with placebo, in patients with post-polio syndrome (44054). Other clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100 mg daily for 60 days does not improve levels of fatigue when compared with placebo in patients with post-polio syndrome (97917).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. There is some evidence that exercise can deplete coenzyme Q10 and that supplementation will prevent this depletion. However, there is no evidence that taking coenzyme Q10 is beneficial.\nClinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 orally does not improve aerobic or anaerobic power or perceived exertion in athletes and non-athletes (2109, 2110, 8911, 44122, 44227). While some evidence suggests coenzyme Q10 slightly improves tolerance to higher workloads, more research is needed to tell if coenzyme Q10 is effective for this purpose (8911). One clinical study shows that taking coenzyme Q10 300 mg orally daily for 8 days reduces exercise-induced fatigue when compared with placebo (44006); other research shows that doses of 100-200 mg do not have this effect (44122, 44233, 44299). Taking the ubiquinol form of coenzyme Q10 200 mg orally daily for one month prevents exercise-induced coenzyme Q10 depletion and decreases levels of reactive oxygen species in blood mononuclear cells in young male athletes performing an intense long-distance run. However, it does not affect physical performance or markers of muscle damage (99429).\nless\nHuntington disease. The ubiquinol form of coenzyme Q10 does not seem to improve function in people with this condition.\nUbiquinol, a reduced form of coenzyme Q10, has been evaluated for use in Huntington disease (11873). However, a large, high-quality study shows that taking coenzyme Q10 2.4 grams orally daily for up to 5 years does not slow the progression or functional decline in patients with Huntington disease (96538). Other studies using doses up to 600 mg daily also show no benefit (1357, 8940).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral coenzyme Q10 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adults with early AMD shows that taking a specific combination product (Phototrop, Sigma-tau Health Science Ltd.) containing coenzyme Q10 10 mg, acetyl-L-carnitine 100 mg, and omega-3 fatty acids 530 mg orally daily for 12 months seems to reduce the percentage of patients who experience deterioration of vision by about 50%, and the percentage who have reduced light sensitivity by about 39%, when compared with placebo (43946). The effects of coenzyme Q10 alone are unclear.\nless\nAging. Although there has been interest in using oral coenzyme Q10 for aging, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of coenzyme Q10 for this purpose.\nAngina. There is some limited clinical evidence that coenzyme Q10 can improve exercise tolerance and symptoms in people with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 50 mg three times daily orally for 4 weeks improves exercise tolerance in people with angina by about 18% (2121). Also, taking 60 mg once daily for 4 weeks improves heart failure scores, angina symptoms, and heart volume when compared to baseline in patients with stable angina (44336). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. Evidence on the use of coenzyme Q10 to protect against anthracycline cardiotoxicity in adults and children is conflicting.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 3-12 years shows that taking coenzyme Q10 orally 100 mg twice daily might protect against anthracycline cardiotoxicity (44279). However, evidence from larger clinical trials evaluating patients aged 16-77 years is conflicting. Results from one of these studies suggests that intravenous administration of coenzyme Q10 1 mg/kg daily the day before, the day of, and for 2 days after anthracycline treatment does not protect against cardiotoxicity (44267). Differences between the studies may be due to methodological problems, or differences in doses, route of administration, and age of participants.\nless\nAsthma. Oral coenzyme Q10 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of coenzyme Q10 (Q-Gel, Tishcon Corporation) 120 mg, vitamin E 400 mg, and vitamin C 250 mg orally daily in addition to conventional anti-asthmatic therapy for 16 weeks might reduce the dosage of corticosteroids required by patients with mild to moderate asthma. However, it does not appear to improve lung function any more than standard therapy alone (43969).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial in children with ADHD.\nA small clinical study in children aged 6-16 years with ADHD who are unresponsive to atomoxetine therapy shows that taking coenzyme Q10 1-3 mg/kg with atomoxetine 0.5-1.8 mg/kg daily for 6 months improves parent-rated symptoms of ADHD, particularly hyperactivity-related symptoms, when compared with placebo plus atomoxetine (107449).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if the ubiquinol form of coenzyme Q10 taken orally is beneficial in children aged 3-6 years with this condition.\nA small clinical study in children aged 3-6 years suggests that taking the reduced form of coenzyme Q10, ubiquinol (Li-QH, Tishcon Corporation), 50 mg orally once daily for one week followed by 50 mg twice daily for 11 weeks, improves symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, including communication with parents, ability to play with friends, verbal communication, sleeping, food rejection, aggressiveness, and self-harm, when compared with baseline, per parent assessment (89419). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size, the use of parent assessment, and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral coenzyme Q10 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with BPH shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100 mg plus L-carnitine daily for 8 weeks modestly decreases prostate volume and improves sexual performance when compared with placebo. There was no effect on prostate symptoms, prostate specific antigen levels, or quality of life. All patients were also taking finasteride 5 mg daily (113226). It is unclear if these effects are due to coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, or the combination.\nless\nBipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for bipolar disorder in older adults.\nPreliminary clinical research in people 55 years of age or older with bipolar disorder shows that taking coenzyme Q10 800 mg orally daily for 4 weeks improves symptoms of depression when compared with baseline (95606). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBreast cancer. Low coenzyme Q10 levels may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The benefit of coenzyme Q10 supplementation is unclear.\nPopulation research in Chinese women has found that low plasma coenzyme Q10 levels are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (44194).\nless\nBurns. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for burns.\nA small clinical study in patients with burns covering 20% to 60% of their body surface area shows that taking coenzyme Q10 300 mg daily for 10 days does not improve length of intensive care stay or mortality when compared with placebo (114555). However, this study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nCancer. Low coenzyme Q10 levels may increase the risk of cancer development and progression.\nPopulation research has found that low coenzyme Q10 levels are associated with increased risk of metastatic melanoma (43959). Preliminary clinical research suggests that taking coenzyme Q10 150 mg twice daily along with vitamins A, C, and E, selenomethionine, beta-carotene, and folic acid extends survival time by 40% when compared with predicted survival in patients with end-stage cancer from various different primary sites (44159). It is unclear if this effect is due to coenzyme Q10, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear whether oral coenzyme Q10 has a role in preventing complications from CVD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 300 mg 2 hours prior to an elective percutaneous coronary intervention does not reduce periprocedural myocardial injury or prevent major adverse cardiac events during one month of follow-up (96543). Other clinical research shows that taking a combination of coenzyme Q10 (Bio-Quinon, Pharma Nord) 100 mg twice daily plus organic selenium yeast tablets (SelenoPrecise, Pharma Nord) 200 mcg daily for 4-5 years reduces the risk of death from CVD by 7% when compared with placebo in elderly people living in Sweden (92904). This benefit appears to persist even after supplement discontinuation, with an 18% reduction at 10 years and an 11% reduction at 12 years (96546, 97466, 97906). In this same trial, post-hoc subgroup analyses in patients with elevated baseline D-dimer levels and/or hypertension or ischemic heart disease shows that taking this combination reduces cardiovascular mortality when compared with placebo (105874). It is unclear if these benefits are due to coenzyme Q10, selenium, or the combination.\nless\nCataracts. It is unclear if coenzyme Q10-containing eye drops are beneficial in patients undergoing cataract surgery.\nClinical research suggests that administering an ophthalmic solution containing coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate twice daily for 9 months increases the speed of nerve regeneration when compared with saline solution in post-cataract surgery patients (44228).\nless\nCerebellar ataxia. It is unclear if coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with cerebellar ataxia shows that coenzyme Q10 30 mg/kg daily for 2 years improves ataxia scores by 48%, posture scores by 63%, and kinetic function scores by 37% when compared with baseline, but only in patients who are coenzyme Q10 deficient (44177). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Oral coenzyme Q10 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with CFS shows that taking coenzyme Q10 200 mg plus NADH 20 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve measures of fatigue, sleep, or quality of life when compared with placebo (107448).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for improving exercise tolerance in people with COPD.\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that taking coenzyme Q10 90 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces lactate production during anaerobic exercise in people with COPD, but does not improve oxygen consumption or exercise performance, when compared with baseline (44293). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nCocaine dependence. Oral coenzyme Q10 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study in patients with cocaine dependence shows that taking a combination of coenzyme Q10 200 mg and L-carnitine 500 mg orally daily for 8 weeks does not reduce cocaine use when compared with placebo, as measured by urine benzoylecgonine levels and self-reported usage (43940).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for patients exposed to COVID-19 or for those with persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection.\nA small, non-randomized, open-label study in adults exposed to COVID-19 shows that taking 20 mg of a specific coenzyme Q10 product daily for 14 days postexposure reduces positive COVID-19 testing by 45% and duration of symptoms by 2 days when compared with no intervention (114558). The validity of these findings is limited by the exploratory nature of the study.\n\nClinical research in individuals with previously confirmed COVID-19 infection and continued symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (Pharma Nord) 100 mg five times daily for 6 weeks does not reduce the number or severity of symptoms when compared with placebo. The most common symptoms were concentration problems, mental and physical fatigue, headache, and/or muscle weakness (109392).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial in patients hospitalized due to acute trauma.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients who are mechanically ventilated due to acute trauma and have low baseline coenzyme Q10 plasma levels shows that taking sublingual coenzyme Q10 (Nutri Q10, Nutri Century) 400 mg daily for 7 days reduces the duration of intensive care stay, mechanical ventilation, and hospitalization by 4 days, 2 days, and 6 days, respectively, when compared with placebo. Patients taking coenzyme Q10 also demonstrated larger improvements in organ function scores and coma scores than those taking placebo (105875).\nless\nCyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS). Limited evidence suggests oral coenzyme Q10 may reduce episodes of CVS.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 10 mg/kg/day is comparable to amitriptyline 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for reducing the number of CVS episodes in both children and adults (17703). Guidelines published by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Association provide a conditional recommendation for the use of coenzyme Q10 as prophylactic therapy for adults in the treatment of CVS based on very-low quality evidence (115640).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for depression.\nA clinical study in patients in Iran with moderate to severe depression shows that taking coenzyme Q10 200 mg daily for 8 weeks in addition to an antidepressant modestly improves depression scores when compared with placebo added to an antidepressant (114557).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. Although there has been interest in using oral coenzyme Q10 for diabetic nephropathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of coenzyme Q10 for this purpose.\nDilated cardiomyopathy. Very small clinical studies suggest that children and adolescents with dilated cardiomyopathy may benefit from oral coenzyme Q10.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with dilated cardiomyopathy suggests that taking coenzyme Q10 3-10 mg/kg daily, divided into 2-3 doses for up to 9 months, improves ejection fraction and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification when compared to baseline (12199, 13223). Also, in people under 20 years of age, taking a specific oral liquid formulation of coenzyme Q10 (QuinoMit Q10 Fluid, MSE Pharmazeutika GmbH), 10 mg/kg daily for 24 weeks produces a small increase in ejection fraction and improves NYHA class from II to I in 30% of patients (99427). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator groups.\nless\nDry eye. Ophthalmic coenzyme Q10 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research has evaluated the use of a specific eye drop (VisuXL, Visufarma) containing coenzyme Q10 and cross-linked hyaluronic acid, in a 1:1 ratio with alpha-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate. One study in menopausal women receiving antidepressants shows that placing 1 drop in each eye twice daily for 8 weeks reduces dry eye severity by 17% and improves tear break-up time when compared to 5 drops daily of carmellose eye drops (104553). In addition, another study in adults with mild to moderate dry eye shows that placing 1 drop in each eye four times daily for 12 weeks reduces dry eye severity by 14% and decreases some laboratory markers of dry eye when compared to hyaluronic acid alone. Both groups demonstrated similar improvement in meibomian gland function and tear break-up time (97909). The effect of coenzyme Q10 when used alone is unclear.\nless\nDry mouth. It is unclear if oral ubiquinol or ubiquinone improves salivary secretion.\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that taking coenzyme Q10, as the reduced ubiquinol form or as the oxidized ubiquinone form, 100 mg orally daily for one month, improves salivary secretion by 72% to 82% when compared with baseline in patients with dry mouth (44191). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial in patients with ED.\nA small, open-label study in patients with hypertension and complaints of ED shows that taking coenzyme Q10 200 mg daily for 3 months along with current antihypertensive therapy does not improve symptoms of ED when compared with antihypertensive therapy alone (107447).\nless\nFatigue. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for reducing fatigue.\nA meta-analysis of low- to moderate-quality clinical research in mixed populations shows that taking coenzyme Q10 modestly reduces feelings of fatigue when compared with placebo. This improvement was consistent between groups of healthy individuals and individuals with fatigue related to disease. However, a sub-group analysis shows that benefits are limited to studies in which coenzyme Q10 was studied as a single ingredient. Doses of coenzyme Q10 ranged from 60 mg to 500 mg daily for 4-12 weeks with treatment effects appearing to be both dose- and duration-dependent (109387).\nless\nFriedreich ataxia. Oral coenzyme Q10 has been evaluated in combination with vitamin E; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (Bio-Quinon Q10, Pharma Nord) 200 mg orally twice daily plus vitamin E (Bio-E-Vitamin, Pharma Nord) 1050 IU twice daily for 47 months improves measures of cardiovascular function by 20% when compared with baseline. However, it does not improve posture or gait, or prevent deterioration of posture, gait, speech, or eye function, when compared with baseline (43943, 44064). It is unclear if these benefits are due to coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, or the combination. Also, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHearing loss. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of oral coenzyme Q10 on hearing loss of various etiologies.\nSome clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 terclatrate (Qter), a water-soluble formulation of coenzyme Q10, 160 mg orally daily for 30 days improves hearing thresholds when compared to baseline in patients with age-related hearing loss (44171, 44184). However, taking coenzyme Q10 terclatrate 200 mg daily for 7 days does not significantly improve hearing thresholds when compared with placebo in patients with noise-induced hearing loss (44143). Also, combining coenzyme Q10 with conventional steroid therapy for 2 weeks does not improve hearing when compared with steroid therapy alone in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (44185).\nless\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nClinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 up to 80 mg orally daily for 28 days does not reduce serum liver enzymes when compared with placebo in patients with chronic hepatitis C who are unresponsive to conventional treatment (44172).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of coenzyme Q10 on cholesterol levels in adults. However, any changes are unlikely to be clinically meaningful.\nA meta-analysis of 50 moderate-quality clinical trials shows that taking coenzyme Q10 has small beneficial effects on levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with a control, usually placebo (109394). However, whether coenzyme Q10 produces clinically meaningful changes is unclear. In a subgroup of patients with dyslipidemia, coenzyme Q10 does not seem to have significant beneficial effects on total cholesterol (109394). Also, previous individual clinical trials and meta-analyses in specific populations, including studies in which lipoprotein A was measured, as well as populations with diabetes, coronary artery disease, and others, have not shown beneficial effects on plasma lipids (17704, 44187, 96545, 97918, 109394).\n\nThe effect of coenzyme Q10 on lipoprotein A has also been investigated. Individual studies and a meta-analysis show that taking coenzyme Q10 slightly reduces plasma levels of lipoprotein A when compared with placebo (17704, 44187, 96545). Most studies have used doses of 100-500 mg daily for 4-24 weeks (17704, 44187, 96545, 96547, 97910, 109394).\n\nCoenzyme Q10 has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. A moderate-sized, open-label clinical study in adults with mild hypercholesterolemia and low cardiovascular disease risk shows that taking a combination product containing coenzyme Q10 2 mg, red yeast rice, grape seed extract, olive tree leaf extract, and B vitamins (Arichol, Epsilon Health) daily for 8 weeks reduces total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, but not HDL cholesterol or triglycerides, when compared with placebo (111559). The validity of this effect is limited by a lack of blinding. It is unclear if this effect is due to coenzyme Q10, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHypertension. Most research suggests that oral coenzyme Q10 may reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not diastolic blood pressure (DBP).\nMost clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100-900 mg orally daily in divided doses, either alone or with conventional medications, for up to 12 weeks significantly lowers SBP (2122, 3365, 9890, 17650, 17651, 17702, 44343, 109393). One meta-analysis of moderate quality clinical research in patients with cardiometabolic disorders shows that supplementation with coenzyme Q10, especially 100-200 mg daily for at least 12 weeks, reduces SBP by 5 mmHg (109393). However, some studies show conflicting results. Most clinical research shows that coenzyme Q10 supplementation does not reduce DBP (8907, 96541, 109393). Also, a meta-analysis of two clinical studies (17651, 44211) shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100-200 mg orally daily has no significant effect on blood pressure when compared with placebo (95607). Conflicting results may be due to differences in the severity of hypertension at baseline, adjustments made to conventional medications during studies, and the presence of a variety of concomitant conditions. Some data also suggest that effects may be greater in people with low baseline levels of coenzyme Q10 (2122, 17650, 17651).\nless\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for this condition.\nA very small clinical study of 7 patients suggests that taking coenzyme Q10 (Vitaline) 120-240 mg orally daily with the goal of raising blood levels above 2 mcg/mL, might improve symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, including dyspnea and fatigue, and decrease cardiac wall thickness, when compared to baseline (11031). The validity of these findings is limited by the small size of the study and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 helps women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment.\nMeta-analyses of several lower- to moderate-quality clinical studies in women with infertility undergoing ART treatment, such as in-vitro fertilization, show that pretreatment with coenzyme Q10 increases the odds of clinical pregnancy by approximately 2-fold, but it does not affect the rate of miscarriages or live births when compared with placebo, control, or no treatment (103780, 115945). The validity of this data is limited by high-risk bias in analyzed studies.\nless\nKidney failure. Oral coenzyme Q10 has been reported to improve renal function in people with kidney failure, but not in those with less severe kidney disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with kidney failure shows that taking coenzyme Q10 180 mg orally daily for 28 days improves blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance when compared with placebo (44347). However, other clinical research in patients with less severe kidney disease shows that taking coenzyme Q10 200 mg daily for 8 weeks does not significantly improve kidney function parameters, including urinary albumin, total protein, or glomerular filtration rate, when compared with placebo (44128).\nless\nLichen planus. It is unclear if topical coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for oral lichen planus. Oral coenzyme Q10 has not been studied for this condition.\nA small clinical study in patients with oral lichen planus conducted in Egypt shows that applying topical coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) 120 mg as a mucoadhesive tablet 3 times daily for 4 weeks does not improve pain scores or lesion size when compared with topical corticosteroid paste (111617).\nless\nMale infertility. Oral coenzyme Q10 may improve some measures of sperm function in males with infertility, but there is no convincing evidence that it can increase pregnancy rates.\nOne small clinical study in males with idiopathic asthenozoospermia shows that coenzyme Q10 200 mg orally daily for 6 months improves sperm motility when compared with baseline (12169). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Coenzyme Q10 has also been studied in males with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (iOAT), but results are conflicting. Studies have used coenzyme Q10 or its reduced form, ubiquinol, in doses of 200-300 mg orally daily for 26 weeks. Sperm density and motility are increased when compared with placebo, but pregnancy rates do not seem to improve (17413, 89422). Three studies have used coenzyme Q10 200-400 mg orally daily for 12-26 weeks, with two reporting increased sperm concentration and motility when compared to baseline, but the other finding no improvements when compared with placebo (44190, 102008, 107444).\n\nCoenzyme Q10 has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients with varying results. Three small clinical studies in adults show that taking a specific combination product providing coenzyme Q10 20 mg twice daily for 6 months, along with acetyl-L-carnitine, L-carnitine, selenium, zinc, vitamin C, folic acid, vitamin B12, and citric acid (Proxeed Plus) improves measures of sperm quality such as sperm count, sperm concentration, total motility, and progressive motility when compared to baseline; however, the effect on sperm volume and morphology is unclear. Most research has been conducted in patients with oligoasthenozoospermia, although some benefit has also been shown in patients with varicocele-related infertility, especially those with more severe varicocele (102017, 107395, 111296). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator group. Another clinical trial in adults shows that taking coenzyme Q10 10 mg and vitamin E 100 mg three times daily for 3 months improves progressive sperm motility and morphology when compared to baseline but not when compared with L-carnitine(109390). It is unclear if these effects are due to coenzyme Q10, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nAdditionally, a single-center, open-label clinical study in adults with iOAT shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (CoQ-10, Natrol) 400 mg daily with letrozole for 3 months increases total sperm count, sperm concentration, and morphology but does not increase sperm motility when compared with letrozole alone (115947).\nless\nMaternally inherited diabetes mellitus and deafness (MIDD). It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for MIDD.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking coenzyme Q10 150 mg orally daily for 3 years might prevent progressive insulin secretory defect, exercise intolerance, and hearing loss when compared with baseline in people with this rare form of diabetes (2125).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome receiving healthy dietary recommendations shows that taking coenzyme Q10 60 mg daily for 12 weeks does not have beneficial effects on blood glucose, cholesterol, waist circumference, or blood pressure when compared with placebo (109284).\nless\nMitochondrial myopathies. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial in patients with mitochondrial myopathies.\nVery small clinical trials show that taking coenzyme Q10 improves certain mitochondrial myopathies; however, not all research agrees. A specific coenzyme Q10 formulation (UbiQGel, Tishcon Corporation) has been evaluated for mitochondrial myopathies, including MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) syndrome, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers). Typical doses are 150-160 mg, or 2 mg/kg, daily, gradually increasing to 3000 mg daily in some cases. The onset of action is slow, with maximal effects around 6 months (8159, 8162, 8163, 8912, 11050, 44240, 97905).\nless\nMyocarditis. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial in patients with acute viral myocarditis.\nA small observational study in Chinese patients with acute viral myocarditis has found that taking coenzyme Q10 10 mg and trimetazidine 20 mg three times daily for 2 weeks, along with standard care, is associated with higher rates of resolution and improved quality of life when compared with coenzyme Q10 plus standard care alone (107443). While coenzyme Q10 alone appeared to improve symptoms and markers of cardiac function when compared to baseline in some patients, the validity of these findings is limited by a lack of placebo control.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Coenzyme Q10 may reduce liver enzymes and the severity of NAFLD.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with NAFLD shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100 mg orally daily for 12 weeks reduces the clinical grade of NAFLD and decreases plasma levels of liver enzymes when compared with placebo (97907).\nless\nObesity. Oral coenzyme Q10 does not seem to improve weight loss in adults.\nA meta-analysis of small, highly heterogeneous clinical trials shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100-300 mg daily for up to 24 weeks does not reduce weight or body mass index when compared with placebo. However, the included studies were not designed to assess for weight loss and involved patients with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, kidney disease, liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and other conditions (105067).\nless\nPeriodontitis. Data on the effects of oral or topical coenzyme Q10 are conflicting. It is unclear if coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for periodontitis.\nSome very small, low-quality studies suggest that taking coenzyme Q10 orally, 50 mg daily for 3 weeks, might be beneficial for periodontitis (8917, 8918). Preliminary research with topical coenzyme Q10 suggests it is ineffective (2107, 2108). However, a meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials evaluating coenzyme Q10 topical gel shows reductions in plaque index, bleeding index, pocket index, clinical attachment level, and gingival index when compared with placebo gel or scaling and root planing alone. The greatest effects are seen when coenzyme Q10 gel is applied directly into the periodontal pocket daily for at least six weeks in combination with scaling and root planing (108958). The validity of these findings is limited by a high risk of bias and the overall low quality of the included studies.\n\nCoenzyme Q10 has also been studied in combination with other ingredients for periodontitis. A small clinical study in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a supplement containing 30 mg of coenzyme Q10 in addition to alpha-lipoic acid, cranberry extract, grapeseed extract, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not improve periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation, among others, when compared with placebo (111708).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 improves physical performance in older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nA small clinical study in mostly older adults with CKD shows that taking coenzyme Q10 1200 mg daily for 6 weeks does not improve measures of physical exercise endurance including aerobic capacity, total work, and work efficiency when compared with placebo (111558). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size and short study duration.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Most clinical studies suggest that oral coenzyme Q10 modestly improves symptoms in patients with PCOS.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with PCOS shows that taking coenzyme Q10 modestly improves measures of glycemic response, as well as plasma lipids and some sex hormones, when compared with placebo (109384). However, any changes are small and the clinical relevance is unclear. Also, although nine studies were included in the review, the number of studies included for each endpoint was much lower. Most clinical studies included in the analysis used 100-200 mg daily for 8-12 weeks (107446, 109384). An additional small clinical study also shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (Nature Made) 100 mg orally daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and total cholesterol and improves insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo. This study also found that taking coenzyme Q10 reduces alopecia by about 33% and acne by 48% when compared with placebo (97914). Another small clinical study shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces depression, anxiety, and hirsutism when compared with placebo (107446).\nless\nPrader-Willi syndrome (PWS). It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial in patients with PWS.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with Prader-Willi syndrome shows that taking coenzyme Q10 2.5 mg/kg orally daily for one year improves psychomotor development similarly to growth hormone therapy, although this might reflect natural changes in the condition occurring over time (44005).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Taking coenzyme Q10 orally seems to reduce the rate of pre-eclampsia in women at risk for the condition.\nClinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (Q-absorb, Jarrow Formulas) 100 mg orally twice daily during pregnancy, starting at 20 weeks gestation and continuing until term, reduces the rate of pre-eclampsia by about 44% when compared with placebo in women at risk for developing this condition (17201).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 improves symptoms in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.\nA small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder shows that taking coenzyme Q10 300 mg daily for 6 months does not improve attention, working memory, negative symptoms, mood disorders, or quality of life when compared with placebo (105069). This finding is limited by insufficient power and poor protocol adherence, with only 61% of the participants taking at least 90% of the study treatment.\nless\nSepsis. There is no strong evidence that coenzyme Q10 is helpful in the management of sepsis or septic shock.\nPatients with septic shock have been shown to have low levels of coenzyme Q10, but the effects of supplementation are unclear. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days reduces the risk of in-hospital mortality by 69% and improves markers of inflammation, but does not reduce length of ICU stay, when compared with conventional treatment alone (102548). However, other preliminary research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 as ubiquinol 200 mg twice daily for 7 days has no effect on inflammatory or vascular endothelial biomarkers, mortality, or length of stay when compared with placebo (96540). Both studies were small and likely underpowered to detect a meaningful change in clinical outcomes.\nless\nStatin-induced myalgia. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of oral coenzyme Q10 on statin-associated muscular adverse effects, such as myalgia.\nSome clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (Q-Sorb softgel, Nature's Bounty) 100 mg orally daily for 30 days reduces pain intensity when compared with baseline or vitamin E control in patients with statin-induced myalgia (16008, 44345). Other clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (MGC Company) 50 mg orally twice daily for 30 days reduces muscle pain and pain interference with daily activities by 30% to 40% when compared with placebo (95604). One small study in adults with statin-induced myalgia shows that taking liquid coenzyme Q10 (Q-Factor, Giellepi S.p.A) 100 mg orally daily for 3 months modestly reduces pain scores, but not plasma creatine kinase (CK) levels, when compared with placebo (102007). Other clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (Bio-Quinon, Pharma Nord) 100 mg twice daily, with or without selenium, for 3 months, reduces muscle pain and weakness, cramps, and tiredness when compared with placebo (92909).\n\nHowever, not all studies have shown benefit. Meta-analyses of several small randomized controlled trials show that taking coenzyme Q10 100-600 mg daily for 1-3 months does not improve muscle pain, statin tolerability, or plasma CK activity in patients with statin-induced myalgia when compared with placebo (95602 ,103781,106050). However, the validity of these results is limited by small population size and high heterogeneity. Other clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 60 mg twice daily for 3 months does not improve muscle pain when compared with placebo (44218). Also, taking coenzyme Q10 (Q-Gel, Tishcon Corporation) 200 mg daily for 12 weeks does not affect myalgia scores when compared with placebo in patients taking simvastatin (44346). Additionally, taking high doses of coenzyme Q10 600 mg daily for 8 weeks does not affect the incidence, severity, or time to onset of statin-induced myalgia when compared with placebo in patients taking simvastatin (95603).\n\nReasons for these conflicting findings are not entirely clear. The inconsistent results do not appear to be related to the dose of coenzyme Q10 or plasma CK levels. About 50% of patients who experience statin-induced myalgia will tolerate a statin re-challenge with a lower or equivalent dose of the same or alternative statin after a statin-free interval, which is a higher response rate than seen in currently available studies with the use of coenzyme Q10. Taking coenzyme Q10 for 30 days may be a reasonable option if other attempts to improve tolerance have failed. If a significant improvement in pain related to statin use is not seen after 30 days of taking coenzyme Q10, it is unlikely to be beneficial (96548).\nless\nStatin-induced myopathy. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of coenzyme Q10 on statin-associated muscular adverse effects, including myopathy.\nClinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (Bio-Quinon, Pharma Nord) 100 mg orally twice daily, with or without selenium, for 3 months, reduces muscle weakness and pain, cramps, and tiredness when compared with placebo in patients with statin-induced myopathy due to atorvastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin (92909). Preliminary clinical research also shows that taking coenzyme Q10 60 mg orally four times daily decreases the rate of dose-limiting statin-induced myopathy in patients taking high-dose lovastatin as an investigational treatment for cancer (11899, 11900). However, when coenzyme Q10 (Myoquinon, Pharma Nord,) 400 mg orally daily is used in combination with selenium for 12 weeks, it does not affect atorvastatin-induced myopathy when compared with placebo (92908).\nless\nToxin-induced liver damage. Oral coenzyme Q10 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients being treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs shows that taking coenzyme Q10 200 mg, acetyl-L-carnitine 250 mg, and alpha-lipoic acid 250 mg twice daily for 2 weeks reduces the risk of drug-induced liver injury by 73% when compared with placebo (107445). It is unclear if these findings are due to coenzyme Q10, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral coenzyme Q10 is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with ulcerative colitis shows that taking oral coenzyme Q10 (Nutri Q10, Nutri Century Company) 100 mg twice daily for 8 weeks modestly improves ulcerative colitis disease activity and quality of life scores when compared with placebo. Taking coenzyme Q10 also reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 4 mmHg and 2 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo (106049). The clinical relevance of these changes is unclear.\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if topical application of coenzyme Q10 is beneficial for wound healing.\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing oral surgery for gingival recession shows that application of coenzyme Q10 spray (45 mg/mL) to oral wounds 3 times daily for 3 weeks does not promote wound healing or improve patient-reported pain when compared with placebo (115948).\nless\nWrinkled skin. It is unclear if topical application of coenzyme Q10 cream can reduce wrinkles.\nA small clinical study shows that applying a coenzyme Q10 1% cream to the skin twice daily for 5 months reduces objective wrinkle scores when compared to baseline (44082). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate coenzyme Q10 for these uses.",

Four cases of decreased warfarin efficacy thought to be due to coenzyme Q10 have been reported (2128, 6048, 11048). However, there is some preliminary clinical research that suggests coenzyme Q10 might not significantly decrease the effects of warfarin in patients who have a stable INR (11905).\nless",

Theoretically, this may increase the risk of adverse effects.\nless\nBETA-CAROTENE\nTaking coenzyme Q10 with beta-carotene can increase beta-carotene levels.\nIn clinical research, supplementation with coenzyme Q10 increased beta-carotene levels (44330).

Theoretically, using coenzyme Q10 in combination with omega-3 fatty acids might reduce the effects of coenzyme Q10.\nless\nRED YEAST RICE\nRed yeast rice contains an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. This constituent may reduce the synthesis and endogenous levels of coenzyme Q10.\nTheoretically, since red yeast rice has HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (\"statin\") constituents it may reduce synthesis of mevalonic acid, a precursor of coenzyme Q10 (512, 3370). This might reduce endogenous coenzyme Q10 levels.\nless\nVITAMIN K\nCoenzyme Q10 has vitamin K-like activity and may increase its effects.\nCoenzyme Q10 is chemically similar to vitamin K2 (menaquinone) and can have vitamin K-like effects, including antagonism of warfarin (2128, 6048). Concomitant use of coenzyme Q10 and vitamin K might cause additive effects and increase the risk of clotting in people taking anticoagulants.\nless",

However, plasma levels of coenzyme Q10 might actually rise immediately after treatment with these drugs, due to myocardial tissue damage resulting in release of coenzyme Q10 into plasma (14412). Preliminary research suggests that coenzyme Q10 might protect against anthracycline cardiotoxicity, possibly through correction of coenzyme Q10 deficiencies and scavenging of free radicals (2134). However, conflicting evidence exists (44267). Additional research is needed before coenzyme Q10 supplementation can be routinely recommended during anthracycline therapy.\nless\nANTIDIABETES DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nMetformin and sulfonylureas can modestly decrease endogenous levels of coenzyme Q10, but coenzyme Q10 supplements are not likely to be needed for patients taking these drugs.\nSome antidiabetes drugs, including metformin and sulfonylureas, appear to inhibit coenzyme Q10 enzyme activity and decrease endogenous levels of coenzyme Q10 (4479). However, there is no strong evidence that coenzyme Q10 depletion is the cause of antidiabetes drug-related side effects. Furthermore, taking coenzyme Q10 does not seem to improve fasting glucose levels or glycated hemoglobin in patients with diabetes (96544, 97911, 97918).\nless\nANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nSome antihypertensive drugs can modestly decrease endogenous levels of coenzyme Q10.\nSome antihypertensive drugs, including beta blockers, diazoxide, hydralazine, and others, appear to inhibit coenzyme Q10 enzyme activity and may decrease endogenous levels of coenzyme Q10 (4479).

However, it is not clear whether this contributes to statin adverse effects, or if coenzyme Q10 supplements reduce these adverse effects.\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can reduce serum coenzyme Q10 levels (4404, 4405, 4406, 4407, 4408, 4409, 4410, 15115). They block the synthesis of mevalonic acid, which is a precursor of coenzyme Q10, in a dose-dependent manner (3370). Taking atorvastatin 80 mg daily for 30 days reduces coenzyme Q10 serum levels by 52%, but atorvastatin 10 mg daily or pravastatin 20 mg daily do not have this effect in healthy people (8915, 12099). In other research, taking simvastatin 20 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces serum coenzyme Q10 levels by about 32%, but muscle levels increase by 47% (3367). Since coenzyme Q10 is transported with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, reduction in LDL cholesterol levels by a statin may increase the amount of free coenzyme Q10 in the blood that is available for uptake into muscles (15115). There is no reliable evidence that statin adverse effects such as myopathy are linked to reduced coenzyme Q10 levels in the blood, or that taking coenzyme Q10 supplements reduces statin side effects.\nless\nTHIAZIDE DIURETICS\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nThiazides can modestly decrease endogenous levels of coenzyme Q10.\nThiazide diuretics might decrease endogenous levels of coenzyme Q10 (95755).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with coenzyme Q10.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCoenzyme Q10 is a large, hydrophobic molecule, around 864 Daltons in size, and is poorly absorbed when taken orally (11031, 108954, 108957). Absorption from food sources appears to be equivalent to absorption from supplements (44317, 44359). Coenzyme Q10 is detected in plasma about 4 hours after oral ingestion, and peak levels occur in 5-10 hours (2134, 7000, 8907, 108954, 108957). Research suggests that effervescent, fast-melting, and gel capsule formulations have similar, low oral bioavailability (11049, 43979). Methods used to increase absorption include emulsification, micronization, and solubilization, as well as preparation of oil suspensions, liposomes, micelles, nanoparticles, or colloids. These preparations generally have greater bioavailability than softgels, tablets, or powder-filled hard-shell capsules (457, 43968, 44098, 44168, 44325, 44360, 108957). Research in humans shows that about 7% of a dose is absorbed from lipid softgels containing non-crystalline coenzyme Q10, about 3% from lipid softgels containing crystals, and about 1% from hard-shell capsules containing dry powder (108957).\nDistribution\nSteady-state is reached after about 14 days in humans, when plasma levels are around 3 mcg/mL with non-crystalline coenzyme Q10 in lipid softgels, 2.5 mcg/mL with crystals in lipid softgels, and 1.5 mcg/mL with powder in hard-shell capsules (108957). From the plasma, coenzyme Q10 is distributed to the inner mitochondrial membrane of cells in cardiac tissue and sperm, and is also found in semen, platelets, mononuclear cells, and lipoproteins (7000, 43956, 43986, 44013, 44021, 44039, 44110, 109383). It is also taken up by the liver and transferred mainly to very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and redistributed from the liver to the systemic blood (44242).\nExcretion\nThe elimination half-life of coenzyme Q10 is approximately 34 hours (2134, 7000, 8907, 44242, 108954).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCoenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like, fat soluble compound present in virtually all cells and in especially high concentrations in the heart, liver, kidney, and pancreas. Within the cell, 25% to 30% of total coenzyme Q10 is found in the nucleus, 40% to 50% in the mitochondria, 15% to 20% in the microsomes, and 5% to 10% in the cytosol (2134, 11892). Its primary activity is as an antioxidant, a membrane stabilizer, and a cofactor in many metabolic pathways, particularly the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in oxidative respiration (2134, 6037, 6048, 6410, 11892).\n\nThe body produces adequate amounts of coenzyme Q10, so it is not considered a vitamin (11893). It is also ingested in small amounts from dietary sources, including meats and seafood. However, the amounts ingested in foods do not approach therapeutic doses (457).\n\nThe biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 is a 17-step process that requires riboflavin, niacinamide, pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine, cobalamin (B12), folic acid, vitamin C, and other trace elements (89413). Acquired deficiency of coenzyme Q10 may be caused by inadequate intake of these nutrients.\nAnalgesic effects\nPatients with fibromyalgia have reduced coenzyme Q10 levels and downregulated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Clinical evidence shows that oral coenzyme Q10 increases AMPK activation, which may improve symptoms of fibromyalgia, including pain (89416).\nAnti-chemotherapy toxicity effects\nAnthracycline chemotherapeutic agents are thought to inhibit coenzyme Q10 mitochondrial enzymes and synthesis of coenzyme Q10 in the heart. Although anthracyclines seem to decrease coenzyme Q10 synthesis, in some cases coenzyme Q10 plasma levels might rise immediately after treatment with these drugs. This might be due to myocardial tissue damage resulting in release of coenzyme Q10 into plasma (14412). Preliminary research suggests that coenzyme Q10 might protect against anthracycline cardiotoxicity, possibly through correction of coenzyme Q10 deficiencies and scavenging of free radicals (2134).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that taking oral coenzyme Q10 60-500 mg daily for 8-12 weeks significantly reduces levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 (102009). Clinical research in adults with coronary artery disease shows that coenzyme Q10 150 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces IL-6 levels but does not significantly affect high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCrp) levels (44214). In vitro evidence shows that coenzyme Q10 attenuates the effect of TNF-alpha on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, but not PPAR-alpha (44067). However, other research in humans shows that taking coenzyme Q10 has no effect on inflammatory biomarkers (96540, 109383).\nAntiaging effects\nCoenzyme Q10 levels are highest during the first 20 years of life and decline with age. At age 80, coenzyme Q10 levels may be lower than at birth. In some kinds of bacteria, coenzyme Q10 seems to prolong life (11895). However, life-long administration of coenzyme Q10 to rodents doesn't affect lifespan (11896).\n\nSome early research suggests that coenzyme Q10 may inhibit the activity of a particular aging-related enzyme. Taking coenzyme Q10 60 mg 2-3 times daily for 28 days decreases levels of the enzyme ECTO-NOX (arNOX) in saliva, perspiration, and serum (44080), and reduces the activity of arNOX in the saliva of older individuals (44081). This enzyme, which increases in activity beginning at the age of 30 years until about 55 years, is believed to propagate the aging cascade (44080).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in the use of coenzyme Q10 for cancer due to its antioxidant properties. It might also have immunostimulatory activity (3993).\n\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in patients with breast cancer suggests that taking coenzyme Q10 100 mg daily for 45-90 days can reduce serum levels of angiogenesis and inflammatory markers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and increase serum levels of antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione, when compared with control. However, these results are limited by high heterogeneity between studies and concomitant use of other supplements (105876). There is also some evidence that coenzyme Q10 concentrations are lower in cancerous breast tissue than healthy tissue (4846, 5158). Some researchers speculate that very low levels of coenzyme Q10 might be an indicator of a poor prognosis, but the effects of coenzyme Q10 on clinical outcomes have not been studied (4846).\n\nAlso, in vitro research shows that coenzyme Q10 can inhibit Cdt1, a human replication initiation protein, from interacting with geminin, a nuclear protein that downregulates Cdt1 function (44000). Theoretically, the disruption of the Cdt1-geminin interaction may induce cell death in some cancer cell lines.\nAntioxidant effects\nMany of the therapeutic benefits of coenzyme Q10 are primarily attributed to its antioxidant effects and its role in the generation of ATP (43987, 44027, 44199, 44210, 44214, 44283, 44287, 44305, 109385, 109386). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking coenzyme Q10 increases antioxidative capacity and reduces malondialdehyde in most adults. However, it is unclear whether a specific population is most likely to benefit, or whether there is an optimal dose and duration of coenzyme Q10 (109385).\n\nGenetic or acquired disorders of mitochondrial function cause increases in serum lactate and the lactate/pyruvate ratio, due to impaired oxidative metabolism. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 seems to reduce these levels and improve exercise tolerance and function in people with these disorders (8159, 8162, 8163). In addition, coenzyme Q10 may be helpful for people with diseases for which coenzyme Q10 levels are often lower, including congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, periodontitis, certain muscular diseases, and HIV/AIDS (2134, 6410).\n\nIn the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), the mechanism is thought to involve prevention of oxidative damage. The greatest benefit seems to occur in people with the largest deficiency of coenzyme Q10 (2134). The effect in the treatment of angina may be due to increased ATP synthesis, reduction of free radicals, or membrane protection (2134). Preliminary evidence suggests that coenzyme Q10 might enhance endothelium-independent arterial relaxation and improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation, which can lower total peripheral resistance and systolic blood pressure. This effect seems to be caused by increased endothelial production of prostacyclin (PGI2) or increased sensitivity of arterial smooth muscle to PGI2, or both (8908). It may also stabilize myocardial calcium-dependent ion channels and reduce consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine triphosphate synthesis (108954).\n\nCoenzyme Q10 administration has been shown to be partially effective for suppressing oxidative stress in hemodialysis patients. Oxygen radical-absorbing capacity, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and levels of F2-isoprostanes are reduced by coenzyme Q10 (44027, 97903).\n\nIn men with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT), coenzyme Q10 improved total antioxidant capacity, catalase activity, and superoxide dismutase activity in the semen (102008). This antioxidant activity is thought to contribute to improvements in sperm concentration and motility (17413, 89422, 102008).\n\nIn patients with diabetes, the coenzyme Q10 content of LDL cholesterol may play a role in its resistance to in vitro oxidation (44353). In vitro evidence shows that coenzyme Q10 reduces LDL oxidation in lipoproteins (44151, 43956, 44327).\nCardiovascular effects\nCoenzyme Q10 increases plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, vitamin E, and vitamin C; and decreases levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and products of lipid peroxidation such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), malondialdehyde, and diene conjugates (3365, 15115, 17650, 44214). In patients at risk for future coronary events, coenzyme Q10 may prevent thrombosis and have protective effects on vascular and myocardial remodeling and endothelial function (10152). Hypothetically, the direct action of coenzyme Q10 on vascular endothelium might reduce blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance (95607).\n\nCoenzyme Q10 can undergo oxidation/reduction reactions in various cell membranes such as lysosomes, Golgi, or plasma membranes. The proton gradient caused by the redox ability of coenzyme Q10 provides a basis for antioxidant action either directly or by regeneration of vitamin E (tocopherol) and ascorbate (8913). Preliminary research suggests that decreased redox status of coenzyme Q10 might indicate a higher risk for coronary heart disease in people with familial hyperlipidemia (8914). Patients with coronary artery disease appear to have a lower ratio of ubiquinol to ubiquinone compared to healthy individuals, suggesting that lipoproteins of CAD patients are more susceptible to free radical reactions compared to healthy individuals (44307).\n\nIn elderly individuals with low selenium levels, a combination of coenzyme Q10 200 mg daily plus selenium yeast 200 mcg daily for 48 months improves cardiac function, reduces cardiac wall tension, improves biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, and lowers cardiovascular mortality during 12 years of follow-up. The combination reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to reduced fibrosis and improved myocardial function (108955).\n\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies shows that taking coenzyme Q10 150-300 mg daily for 6-12 weeks improves certain measures of endothelial function, such as flow mediated dilation, when compared with control (114559). In addition, fenofibrate and coenzyme Q10 seem to improve endothelial and non-endothelial forearm vasodilator function in patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia (11877). Furthermore, in clinical research in adults with metabolic-dysfunction associated with steatotic liver disease, taking coenzyme Q10 improves some measures of endothelial and vascular function, including pulse wave velocity, flow-mediated dilation, and arterial stiffness from baseline (115944).\n\nCoenzyme Q10 has been shown to improve diastolic function in patients taking statins (43936).\n\nPreoperative coenzyme Q10 increases myocardial and cardiac mitochondrial coenzyme Q10 levels, improves mitochondrial efficiency, and increases myocardial tolerance to oxidative stress in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery (43920, 43937, 44021).\nDermatologic effect\nIn vitro, coenzyme Q10 inhibits UVB-induced damage in keratinocytes and fibroblasts (44082). Also, the production of reactive oxygen species and interleukin-6, and damage to DNA are reduced, and matrix metalloproteinases are inhibited. Theoretically, these effects may prevent degradation of dermal fiber components of the skin and attenuate wrinkling. Other in vitro research shows that coenzyme Q10 may attenuate skin aging by protecting dermal and epidermal cells against oxidative stress-induced cell death and enhancing the synthesis of basement membrane components (laminin 332, type IV and VII collagens) (44133). Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that applying a coenzyme Q10 1% cream to the skin for 5 months reduces objective wrinkle scores (44082).\nExercise effects\nCoenzyme Q10 appears to increase fat oxidation and enhance autonomic nervous activity during low-intensity exercise in healthy individuals (44049). Other research shows that coenzyme Q10 decreases the resting and post-exercise inorganic phosphate (Pi) to phosphocreatine (PCr) ratio and the half-time of recovery for phosphocreatine in muscles of post-polio subjects, suggesting that coenzyme Q10 affects muscle energy metabolism in these patients (44319). However, in humans, oral coenzyme Q10 does not seem to improve power or perceived exertion. There is some evidence that it slightly improves tolerance to higher workloads and reduces exercise-induced fatigue (2109, 2110, 8911, 44006, 44122, 44227). A meta-analysis of small clinical studies shows that taking coenzyme Q10 90-300 mg daily for up to 12 weeks improves markers of muscle fatigue such as creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels when compared with control (114554). Coenzyme Q10 seems to provide antioxidant effects (99429). In addition, based on blood levels of bone and metabolic markers, taking the ubiquinol form of coenzyme Q10 might improve bone formation and muscle recovery following strenuous exercise (104552).\nHepatic effects\nThere is interest in using coenzyme Q10 as a hepatoprotective agent. In clinical research in adults with metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), taking coenzyme Q10 reduces steatosis, as measured by controlled attenuation parameter scores, and decreases plasma levels of liver enzymes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Coenzyme Q10 also increases levels of adiponectin and serum leptin (97907, 115944).\nImmunostimulating effects\nIn theory, coenzyme Q10 may have positive effects on immune response (44244). Coenzyme Q10 has been shown to increase blood levels of IgG, T4-lymphocytes, and ratio of T4/T8 lymphocytes (44297). Evidence from animal research also shows that coenzyme Q10 can decrease peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A in ascites-susceptible broilers (43985). In vitro research shows that coenzyme Q10 decreases the secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-2 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (44169).\nMitochondrial effects\nCoenzyme Q10 appears to be a factor in Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease might be caused by impaired function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and particularly the mitochondrial enzymes, complex I and complex II (44140). Coenzyme Q10 is the electron acceptor for these complexes. People with Parkinson disease seem to have lower levels of coenzyme Q10 in platelet mitochondria (43902, 44140, 44321). Preliminary research in humans suggests that coenzyme Q10 increases the activity of complex 1 (43902, 44321). Also, preclinical research suggests that supplementation increases cerebral concentrations of coenzyme Q10 and reduces the loss of dopamine and dopaminergic axons in experimental models of Parkinson disease (8938, 8939). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that coenzyme Q10 attenuates changes in Parkinson disease cybrid peroxide, protein carbonyl, and protein sulfhydryl levels via mechanisms that may include restoration of ATP to control levels, and normalization of Parkinson disease cybrid free tubulin:polymerized tubulin ratios (44046).\n\nThere is also interest in using coenzyme Q10 for Huntington disease, which is also thought to be a mitochondrial disorder. In animal models of Huntington disease, orally administered coenzyme Q10 extends survival and delays development of motor deficits, weight loss, cerebral atrophy, and neuronal changes (8941). Usefulness in humans hasn't been demonstrated at doses of 600 mg per day or less (8940). Some researchers suggest that L-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 might have an additive or synergistic effect. Both coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine are involved with maintaining mitochondrial energy production in cells and may help protect against oxidative and toxin-induced damage (3653, 9603), but it isn't known whether this has any clinical significance.\n\nFor migraine headaches, coenzyme Q10 might work by improving mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which appears to be impaired in some patients with migraines (8135, 11897). Some people with migraine headache might have low levels of coenzyme Q10. The reference range for serum total coenzyme Q10 levels is 0.5-1.5 mcg/mL. As many as 32.9% of pediatric and adolescent migraine patients have serum coenzyme Q10 levels below the reference range (15256).\n\nIn vitro evidence suggests coenzyme Q10 might prevent cardiotoxicity caused by phenothiazines and tricyclic antidepressants. It seems to block mitochondrial dysfunction induced by these drugs (8959). In bipolar disorder, coenzyme Q10 might work by facilitating mitochondrial ATP production, which data suggests is impaired in patients with bipolar disorder (95606).\n\nIn patients with mitochondrial cytopathies, including mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); mitochondrial DNA deletions; and other mitochondrial diseases, taking a combination of creatine monohydrate, coenzyme Q10, and lipoic acid supplementation lowers resting plasma lactate and urinary 8-isoprostanes, suggesting reduced oxidative stress, and attenuates the decline in peak ankle dorsiflexion strength in all patient groups (43976). Other preliminary research suggests that coenzyme Q10 improves brain and muscle mitochondrial respiration in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies (43901).\n\nIn fibroblasts from patients with coenzyme Q10 deficiency, coenzyme Q10 partially restores the decreased activities of complex II+III, complex III, and complex IV; the reduced expression of various mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation; the potential of the mitochondrial membrane; the increased production of reactive oxygen species; the activation of mitochondrial permeability transition; the reduced cellular growth rates; and the accompanying autophagy (44085).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce serum coenzyme Q10 levels (4404, 4405, 4406, 4407, 4408, 4409, 4410, 15115). But levels in muscles don't appear to be affected (3367). Some researchers think statin-induced myopathy may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by reduced coenzyme Q10 levels. Coenzyme Q10 and cholesterol share common synthetic pathways. Statins block the synthesis of both. Coenzyme Q10 does not affect the cholesterol-lowering effect of statins (11898).\n\nCoenzyme Q10 is transported with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Some evidence indicates that the statin-related decrease in coenzyme Q10 levels is due to the reduction of cholesterol levels by statins. Increasing cholesterol reduction is correlated with increased reduction in coenzyme Q10 plasma levels (15115). The cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe (Zetia) does not appear to significantly affect coenzyme Q10 plasma levels (15115).\n\nCoenzyme Q10 may be a biomarker to determine if patients have fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia may cause an altered distribution of coenzyme Q10 in the body, with higher levels of coenzyme Q10 in the plasma; as well as reduced cell uptake and metabolism of coenzyme Q10 into mononuclear cells. The reduction in coenzyme Q10 within the mononuclear cells may lead to higher levels of reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress in patients with fibromyalgia (17705). Early research suggests that taking coenzyme Q10 along with ginkgo improves physical fitness levels, emotional feelings, social activities, overall health, and pain in fibromyalgia patients (17716).\nNeurological effects\nAnimal research suggests that coenzyme Q10 reduces beta-amyloid plaque production and deposit in experimental models of Alzheimer disease (44002, 44140). A decrease in malondialdehyde levels and upregulated activity of superoxide dismutase may play a role in this effect. However, other evidence from in vitro research suggests that coenzyme Q10 facilitates tau aggregation and may play a role in the formation of Hirano bodies (44017).\nOcular effects\nThere is significant clinical interest in using coenzyme Q10 for various eye disorders. In vitro research suggests that coenzyme Q10 prevents apoptotic cell death in human lens epithelial cells. A reduction in oxidative stress and the stabilization of the BAX:Bcl-2 ratio plays a role (44170). There is also interest in whether antioxidant effects of coenzyme Q10 might reverse vision loss caused by vascular retinal diseases. A small case series in patients with different retinal vascular diseases such as ischemic optic neuropathy and retinal vein occlusion has found that taking coenzyme Q10 with vitamins is associated with modest vision improvement when compared with baseline (103779).\nOtic effects\nAnimal research shows that coenzyme Q10 prevents age-related hearing loss in mice (44145). The mechanism of action involves the suppression of Bak expression in the cochlea, which reduces cochlear cell death and slows the progression of AHL.\nRenal effects\nThere is interest in using coenzyme Q10 and selenium to improve kidney function. A clinical study in healthy older adults ages 70-88 years shows that taking coenzyme Q10 (Bio-Quinon, Pharma Nord) 200 mg with organic selenium yeast tablets (SelenoPrecise, Pharma Nord) 200 mcg daily for 2 years seems to increase estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from 58.3 to 63.7 mL/min/1.73 m2, compared with no change in the placebo group (105066). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer.\nRespiratory effects\nIn patients with sleep apnea, an antioxidant cocktail containing coenzyme Q10 reduces progressive augmentation and ventilatory long-term facilitation of respiratory motor output, which are normally enhanced in these patients due to exposure to intermittent hypoxia (44137)."

According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, drinking up to 4 cups of coffee daily providing caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults (11733, 98806). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of beverages such as coffee that contain caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults (98806).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive amounts. Acute use of high doses of caffeine (more than 400 mg per day), which is found in more than 4 cups of caffeinated coffee, has been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmia and sleep disturbances (11832). Drinking caffeinated coffee in amounts greater than 6 cups per day (about 600 mg caffeine) short-term or long-term can also cause caffeinism, with symptoms of anxiety possibly progressing to delirium and agitation. Chronic use of caffeine, especially in large amounts, can sometimes produce tolerance, habituation, and psychological dependence (3719). Abrupt discontinuance of caffeine can cause physical withdrawal symptoms (11733). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as coffee, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. ...when used rectally as an enema. Coffee enemas have been linked to cases of severe electrolyte abnormalities and septicemia leading to severe side effects including death (3026, 3347, 3349, 6652).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when coffee containing caffeine is consumed orally in moderate amounts. Oral intake of caffeine in doses of less than 2.5 mg/kg daily is not associated with significant adverse effects in children and adolescents (11733, 98806). However, higher doses should be avoided. The adverse effects typically associated with caffeine-containing coffee are usually more severe in children than adults (11733).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. Intake of caffeine from coffee and other sources should be monitored during pregnancy. Caffeine crosses the human placenta, but is not considered a teratogen. Fetal blood and tissue levels are similar to maternal concentrations (4260). The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects (2708, 2709, 2710, 2711, 9606, 11733, 16014, 16015). However, some research has also found that intrauterine exposure to even modest amounts of caffeine, based on maternal blood levels during the first trimester, is associated with a shorter stature in children ages 4-8 years (109846). In some studies, consuming amounts over 200 mg daily has been associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage (16014). This increased risk may be most likely to occur in people with genotypes that confer a slow rate of caffeine metabolism (98806). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, most healthy pregnant patients can safely consume caffeine in doses up to 300 mg daily without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations (11733, 98806). Advise patients to keep caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily during pregnancy. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 3 cups of coffee. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as coffee, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when caffeinated coffee providing more than 300 mg of caffeine daily is consumed orally. Caffeine from coffee crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels (4260). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 300 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage in some studies (16014, 98806). Advise patients to keep caffeine consumption from all sources below 300 mg daily during pregnancy. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 3 cups of coffee. High doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants (9891). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight (2709, 2711). Drinking more than 6 cups of coffee daily increases the risk of spontaneous abortion (2709). Drinking 8 or more cups of coffee daily doubles the risk of stillbirth when compared with those who do not drink coffee during pregnancy (10621).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally. Drinking one or two caffeine-containing beverages daily during lactation is not associated with unacceptable levels of caffeine in human milk (11734).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Caffeine from coffee can cause wakefulness or irritability in breast-fed infants. Caffeine can also cause feeding intolerance and gastrointestinal irritation in infants (6026).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee is well tolerated in moderate amounts.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Drinking coffee containing caffeine can cause agitation, anxiety, chest pain, diuresis, gastric distress, headache, insomnia, nervousness, premature heart rate, ringing in the ears, and vomiting. These effects are more likely with increasing intake of caffeine and in certain populations (e.g., children, elderly). With chronic caffeine use, especially in large amounts, habituation, tolerance, and psychological dependence can occur.\n\nAbrupt discontinuation of caffeine may result in physical withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, decreased physical energy, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, drowsiness, fatigue, headache, irritability, reduced alertness, and rhinorrhea.\n\nRectally: Coffee enemas have been linked to proctocolitis, severe electrolyte abnormalities, and septicemia leading to death.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, coffee containing caffeine can cause chest pain and premature heartbeat (8042, 111045). These effects are more likely with increasing intake of caffeine and in certain populations (e.g., children, elderly) (8042). Excessive doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent sinus tachycardia (11832, 11838, 13734, 13735).\n\nAlthough acute administration of caffeine can cause increased blood pressure, regular consumption does not seem to increase either blood pressure or pulse, even in hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722, 13739, 105312). Drinking one or more cups of caffeinated coffee daily also doesn't seem to increase the risk of developing hypertension in habitual coffee drinkers (8033, 13739, 111037).\n\nEpidemiological research has found that regular caffeine intake of up to 400 mg daily, or approximately 4 cups of caffeinated coffee, is not associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (38018, 38076, 91028, 91034, 97451, 97453, 105310), atherosclerosis (38033), cardiac ectopy (91127), stroke (37804), ventricular arrhythmia (95948, 97453, 105310), or cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general (37805, 98806, 104882). However, some observational research suggests that drinking at least 1 cup of coffee per week is associated with a 40% increased risk of atrial fibrillation, with the highest incidence of atrial fibrillation occurring in adults consuming at least 6 cups daily (111042). Also, one large, observational study found a J-shaped association between regular coffee consumption and the risk of developing acute coronary syndromes. Moderate consumption of less than 300 mL daily (about 1.3 cups) was associated with a lower risk of developing acute coronary syndromes, whereas regular consumption of 300 mL daily or more was associated with an increased risk (11318). In contrast, other observational research in people without a history of CVD has found that drinking more than 6 cups of coffee daily does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease (14343). Also, in people with a history of CVD, population research has found that coffee consumption is associated with a reduction in CVD-related mortality (97373, 97374, 103997, 103998, 104594, 104595, 104882, 105308, 105311, 105313, 105314); however not all research agrees (112735). However, in current smokers with a history of acute coronary syndrome, consuming more than 3 cups of coffee daily is associated with more than a two-fold increased risk of overall mortality (105313). Also, population research in patients with severe hypertension, but not mild hypertension, suggests that drinking at least two cups of coffee daily is associated with a 2-fold increase in CVD mortality compared with non-coffee drinkers (111027).\n\nCaffeine intake may pose a greater cardiovascular risk to subjects who are not regular caffeine users. Population research suggests that drinking caffeinated coffee might trigger a myocardial infarction (MI) in some people. People who drink one or fewer cups of coffee daily and are sedentary and have multiple risk factors for heart disease have a significantly increased risk of MI within an hour after drinking coffee. However, this risk appears diminished in people who routinely consume greater amounts of coffee on a daily basis (14497). In another population study, caffeinated coffee consumption was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in subjects who didn't regularly drink coffee (38102).\n\nBoiled coffee that is prepared without a filter appears to increase serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels (1353, 4200, 8036, 8539). Drinking one liter of strong, unfiltered coffee daily for two weeks can raise serum cholesterol by 10% and serum triglycerides by 36% (1353). Tell patients to use coffee filters since these effects do not seem to occur with filtered coffee (4200, 8036, 8539).\n\nCoffee can adversely affect homocysteine levels. Higher homocysteine levels have been associated with CVD. One liter of unfiltered strong coffee daily for two weeks can increase plasma homocysteine levels by 10% (1353). The same amount of filtered strong coffee appears to raise plasma homocysteine levels by 20%, although there have been no head-to-head comparisons of filtered versus unfiltered coffee (3344).\nless\nDermatologic\nSome researchers suggest symptoms such as flushed face occur during caffeine withdrawal. However, withdrawal symptoms may be due to nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects. Clinically significant symptoms caused by caffeine withdrawal may be uncommon (2723, 11839).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, excessive doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, and ketosis (13734). Other symptoms include hypokalemia and respiratory alkalosis (11832, 11838, 13735).\n\nSome evidence shows that caffeine, a constituent of coffee, is associated with fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer, and endometriosis in females; however, this is controversial since findings are conflicting (8043). Restricting caffeine intake in patients with fibrocystic breast conditions doesn't seem to affect breast nodularity, swelling, or pain (8996). Population research suggests that exposure to caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of endometriosis (91035).\n\nA population analysis of the Women's Health Initiative observational study has found no association between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages, such as coffee, and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors (108806). Also, a dose-response analysis of 2 low-quality observational studies has found that high consumption of caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (108807).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, coffee containing caffeine can cause gastric distress and vomiting. These effects are more likely with increasing intake of caffeine and in certain populations (e.g., children, elderly) (8042, 13734). There is also some evidence that consumption of three or more cups of caffeinated coffee might increase the risk of Helicobacter pylori infection (8034).\n\nCaffeine withdrawal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting have been described. However, these symptoms may be due to nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects. Clinically significant symptoms caused by caffeine withdrawal may be uncommon (2723, 11839).\n\nRectally, at least 5 cases of proctocolitis related to the use of coffee enemas have been reported (96868, 103273).\nless\nGenitourinary\nThe caffeine found in coffee is a known diuretic and may increase voiding, give a sense of urgency, and irritate the bladder (37874, 37961, 104580). In males with lower urinary tract symptoms, caffeine intake increased the risk of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (38115). Excessive caffeine consumption may worsen premenstrual syndrome. Consumption of up to 10 cups of caffeinated drinks daily has been associated with increased severity of premenstrual syndrome (38177).\nless\nHematologic\nThere is evidence that coffee containing caffeine shortens whole blood fibrinolysis time (8030).\n\nRectally, coffee enemas have been linked to severe electrolyte abnormalities leading to death (3026, 3347, 3349, 6652)\nless\nHepatic\nBoiled coffee that is prepared without a filter appears to increase liver aminotransferase enzymes. Tell patients to use coffee filters since these effects do not seem to occur with filtered coffee (8539).\nless\nImmunologic\nCaffeine can cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals, although true IgE-mediated caffeine allergy seems to be relatively rare (11315).\n\nRectally, coffee enemas have been linked to septicemia leading to death (3026, 3347, 3349, 6652).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, there is preliminary evidence that use of greater than four cups of coffee daily can increase the risk of rheumatoid factor positive rheumatoid arthritis, but this association has not been confirmed (6482).\n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the relationship between caffeine use and the risk for osteoporosis is contradictory. Caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium (2669, 10202, 11317). Females identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to be at an increased risk for the detrimental effect of caffeine on bone mass (2669). However, moderate caffeine intake of less than 400 mg daily does not seem to significantly increase osteoporosis risk in most postmenopausal adults with normal calcium intake (2669, 6025, 10202, 11317, 98806).\n\nCaffeine withdrawal symptoms, such as muscle tension and muscle pains, have been described. However, these symptoms may be due to nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects. Clinically significant symptoms caused by caffeine withdrawal may be uncommon (2723, 11839).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, coffee containing caffeine can cause agitation, headache, insomnia, and nervousness, . These effects are more likely with increasing intake of caffeine and in certain populations (e.g., children, elderly) (8042, 11832, 11838, 13734, 13735).\n\nCombining ephedra with coffee can increase the risk of adverse effects, due to the caffeine contained in coffee. Jitteriness, seizures, and temporary loss of consciousness have been associated with the combined use of ephedra and caffeine (2729).\n\nSome researchers suggest that symptoms such as headache; tiredness and fatigue; decreased energy, alertness, and attentiveness; drowsiness; decreased contentedness; difficulty concentrating; irritability; and lack of clear-headedness are typical of caffeine withdrawal (13738). Withdrawal symptoms such as delirium, nervousness, and restlessness have also been described. However, these symptoms may be due to nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects. Clinically significant symptoms caused by caffeine withdrawal may be uncommon (2723, 11839).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, coffee containing caffeine can cause ringing in the ears. This is more likely with increasing intake of caffeine and in certain populations (e.g., children, elderly) (8042, 13734). Coffee containing caffeine also increases intraocular pressure, starting about 30 minutes after consumption and persisting for at least 90 minutes. Decaffeinated coffee does not appear to affect intraocular pressure (8540).\nless\nOncologic\nThe association between consumption of coffee and pancreatic cancer is controversial. Coffee may increase the incidence of some types of pancreatic cancers, but it may decrease other types (8535, 8536, 8537). Some studies do not support this association, especially in patients that have never smoked (8038, 8040, 93878, 103999). Patients who are at risk of pancreatic cancer (pancreatitis) should limit their consumption of coffee.\n\nPeople who consume 2-4 or more cups of caffeinated coffee dail might have a significantly increased risk of developing lung cancer (13191, 90177). But drinking decaffeinated coffee seems to be associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer (13191).\n\nCoffee consumption has also been associated at various times with an increased risk of breast cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, and other types of cancers, but there's no good evidence that coffee consumption increases cancer risk (8039, 8040, 8041). Most human studies that have examined caffeine or coffee intake have found that they do not play a role in the development of various cancers, including breast or most gastric cancers (91054, 91076, 98806). However, drinking caffeinated coffee might increase the risk of gastric cardia cancer (91076).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, coffee containing caffeine can cause anxiety. This is more likely with increasing intake of caffeine and in certain populations (e.g., children, elderly) (8042, 13734). With chronic use, especially in large amounts, habituation, tolerance, and psychological dependence can occur (3719). Other researchers suggest symptoms such as depressed mood are typical of caffeine withdrawal (13738). However, withdrawal symptoms may be due to nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects. Clinically significant symptoms caused by caffeine withdrawal may be uncommon (2723, 11839).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nCaffeine withdrawal symptoms such as rhinorrhea have been described. However, these symptoms may be due to nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects. Clinically significant symptoms caused by caffeine withdrawal may be uncommon (2723, 11839).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, coffee containing caffeine can cause diuresis. This is more likely with increasing intake of caffeine and in certain populations (e.g., children, elderly) (8042, 13734).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nMental alertness. Consumption of caffeinated coffee attenuates changes in alertness and cognitive capacity that occur throughout the day. It also improves mental performance and alertness following sleep deprivation.\nConsumption of coffee and other caffeinated beverages seems to prevent a decline in alertness and cognitive capacity when consumed throughout the day (4221, 4224). Caffeine can improve mental performance and alertness following prolonged sleep deprivation (10205).\n\nWith respect to mental alertness while driving, some research shows that drinking a single cup of coffee containing 80 mg caffeine in 180 mL during a 15-minute rest after simulated driving for 2 hours reduces the amount of weaving and increases speed consistency in the 3rd and 4th hours of driving when compared with drinking decaffeinated coffee. Overall, the mental effort needed to drive, driving quality, and feelings of sleepiness appear to improve with caffeine consumption (93875).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Population research has found that consumption of caffeinated coffee is associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Consumption of coffee also seems to be associated with a reduced risk of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nPopulation research suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee is associated with a dose-dependent reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes (11353, 11731, 14313, 38174, 91040, 91055, 111040). Some research suggests that increasing coffee consumption by 1 cup daily is associated with a 6% to 9% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (91040, 91055). In North American adults, consuming 6 or more cups of coffee daily is associated with a 29% lower risk of developing diabetes in females and a 54% lower risk in males (11353). Research in European adults suggests that drinking 5-6 cups of coffee daily appears to reduce diabetes risk by 61% in females and 30% in males. Drinking 10 or more cups daily reduces diabetes risk by 79% in females and 55% in males (11731). Additional research suggests that drinking 3-4 cups of coffee daily reduces the risk of diabetes by 23% to 42% when compared with drinking just 1 cup daily (14343, 38174). An analysis of these and other cohort studies involving over 457,000 patients suggests that drinking 3-4 cups of coffee or decaffeinated coffee daily is associated with a 25% to 35% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes when compared with drinking 2 cups or less daily. Each additional cup of coffee consumed each day is associated with a 5% to 10% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (97368). Some population research in patients with previous gestational diabetes has also investigated the association between consumption of coffee and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Research suggests that consumption of at least 4 cups of caffeinated coffee daily is associated with a 54% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes when compared with drinking no coffee. There is no association between consumption of decaffeinated coffee and type 2 diabetes risk (111040).\n\nCoffee consumption has also been evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes, with mixed findings. Most population research suggests that coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. In one meta-analysis of observational studies, drinking high amounts of coffee was associated with a 24% reduction in mortality risk, with a 9% reduction for each additional cup of coffee (104595). In another meta-analysis, drinking up to 4 cups of coffee daily was associated with a 19% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 34% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality when compared with not drinking coffee. Reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality were only significant when one large study was excluded during sensitivity analyses (107836). Results of individual studies are conflicting (37805, 97374, 104589, 104594).\n\nAdditionally, a cross-sectional study in older adults with type 2 diabetes has examined the relationship between coffee consumption and CVD risk factors. This study suggests that higher coffee consumption is associated with lower fasting plasma glucose and diastolic blood pressure and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels (107825).\n\nPopulation research has examined the relationship between coffee consumption and change in kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes. One study in patients with normal kidney function suggests that drinking any coffee is associated with up to a 25% prevention in kidney function decline when compared with no coffee consumption. Kidney function decline was based on estimated glomerular function rate (eGFR) measurements (111043).\nless\nHeart failure. Consumption of caffeinated coffee seems to reduce the long-term risk of heart failure in those without cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline.\nA meta-analysis of three large population studies, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Cardiovascular Heart Study (CHS), and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, has found that increased daily coffee consumption is associated with a reduced long-term risk of heart failure in individuals without CVD at baseline. Drinking at least 2 cups of coffee daily is associated with a 29% to 31% reduced risk of heart failure. In the analysis, total caffeine intake, but not decaffeinated coffee intake, was associated with a reduced risk of heart failure (104597).\nless\nOverall mortality. Consumption of coffee seems to reduce all-cause mortality. The effects of coffee on specific causes of mortality are variable.\nPopulation research conducted in almost 4 million international individuals suggests that long-term, daily consumption of coffee is associated with an 8% to 28% reduction in all-cause mortality when compared to low or no coffee consumption (97373, 97374, 103997, 103998, 104594, 104595, 105308, 105311, 105314, 107826)(107833, 107839, 111033), though not all research agrees (107822). The strongest association is seen for individuals consuming 2-4 cups of coffee daily and in never smokers. Most research suggests that consuming ground, instant, or decaffeinated coffee is associated with similar reductions in mortality (97373, 97374, 103997, 103998, 104594, 104595, 105308, 105311, 105314, 107833)(111033).\n\nThe use of sweeteners might affect the association of coffee consumption with all-cause mortality. Population research suggests that consumption of unsweetened coffee, in amounts ranging from any to up to 4.5 cups daily depending on type of coffee, is associated with a reduction in mortality of 14% to 39% when compared with no coffee consumption. Consumption of 1.5 to 3.5 cups of sugar-sweetened coffee is associated with a reduction in mortality of approximately 30%; however, this association does not occur with higher coffee intakes or the consumption of decaffeinated coffee. Any association between the consumption of artificially sweetened coffee and mortality is unclear.\n\nWhen subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the association of coffee consumption with cause-specific mortality, coffee consumption was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular mortality. In some analyses, this association is for ground or decaffeinated, but not sweetened, instant, or unfiltered, coffee (97373, 97374, 103997, 103998, 104594, 104595, 105308, 105311, 105314, 107833)(111032). In another analysis, consumption of coffee was inversely associated with deaths from chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, pneumonia and influenza, and intentional self-harm. There were no associations between coffee consumption and deaths from accidents, Alzheimer disease, or kidney disease (105311).\n\nThe association between coffee consumption and cancer-related mortality is less clear. Although one large meta-analysis of population research suggests that consumption of approximately 2 cups of coffee daily is associated with a 4% decrease in cancer-related mortality, the results of individual studies are mixed. One large population cohort suggests that ground or instant caffeinated coffee consumption is associated with up to a 27% reduction in cancer mortality (97374), while other analyses show no association (97373, 103994, 105308, 105311, 107822). The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear but may be related to smoking status or use of sweeteners. In one meta-analysis, consumption of each additional cup of coffee daily is associated with a 2% decrease in cancer-related mortality in non-smokers, as opposed to an increased risk in smokers (105308). Other population research suggests that only intake of unsweetened coffee, and not sugar-or artificially-sweetened coffee, is associated with a reduced risk of cancer-related mortality (111032).\nless\nParkinson disease. Consumption of coffee seems to reduce the risk of developing Parkinson disease. This effect seems to be dose related in males, but not in females.\nThere is evidence that the risk of Parkinson disease is lower in people who consume caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and cola. For males, the effect seems to be dose related. Males consuming the greatest amount of caffeinated coffee, 28 ounces (three to four cups) or a total of 421-2716 mg of caffeine from any source daily, seem to have the greatest reduction in risk. However, a significant reduction in risk exists even with consumption of as little as approximately 1-2 cups of coffee, or 124-208 mg of caffeine, daily (6022). In females, the effect does not seem to be dose related. Moderate consumption of caffeinated coffee, 1-3 cups daily, provides the greatest reduction in risk (1238). Coffee does not appear to provide additional protection from Parkinson disease in cigarette smokers (9236).\nless\nPostoperative ileus. Consumption of coffee seems to decrease the time to first stool and first flatus, and possibly time to discharge, after gynecological or colorectal surgeries.\nMeta-analyses of mainly small clinical trials in patients who have undergone gynecological or colorectal surgeries show that drinking coffee decreases the time to the first stool and time to tolerating solid food by about 10-15 hours when compared with no treatment or drinking water or tea (103991, 111035, 112732). Although one meta-analysis found that drinking coffee does not reduce the length of hospital stay (103991), other research shows that hospital stay is reduced by up to 1.5 days; however, the validity of these results are limited by high heterogeneity. In addition, sub-analyses suggest that benefit is limited to gynecological surgery and not colorectal surgery or caesarian section (97386, 111035, 112732). Sub-analyses also suggest that drinking coffee does not improve bowel function after caesarian section (103991, 111035). Caffeinated coffee has been most commonly consumed as 100 mL three times daily starting after surgery and until the first stool. Some studies have used decaffeinated coffee (93876, 97386, 103991, 111035, 111039).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nEsophageal cancer. Consumption of coffee does not seem to be associated with a reduced risk of esophageal cancer.\nPopulation research has found that coffee intake is not associated with the incidence of esophageal cancer (9222, 90186, 100874). However, subgroup analyses have found coffee consumption may be associated with a reduced risk of esophageal cancer in patients from East Asia (100874).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtherosclerosis. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for atherosclerosis.\nPopulation research has found that drinking coffee is not associated with prevalent coronary-artery calcium, a subclinical marker of atherosclerosis, in patients without known coronary heart disease (97371).\nless\nAtrial fibrillation. It is unclear if consuming coffee affects the risk of atrial fibrillation. The available research is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of observational research suggests that coffee intake is not associated with the incidence of atrial fibrillation (100860). However, a more recent observational study suggests that drinking at least 1 cup of coffee per week is associated with a 40% increased risk of atrial fibrillation, with the highest incidence of atrial fibrillation occurring in adults consuming at least 6 cups daily. A sub-analysis found that this association remained only for White participants and not other ethnicities (111042). This study was limited by its relatively small sample size and a higher than general proportion of smokers. Some observational research in elderly persons following the Mediterranean diet suggests that consuming 4-28 cups of coffee monthly (up to 1 cup daily) is associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation when compared with 3 cups or less monthly. Consuming more than 1 cup of coffee daily was not associated with reduced risk (103988). However, it is unclear if this association was due to moderate coffee consumption, the Mediterranean diet, or other, unidentified factors.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there has been interest in consuming coffee for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of coffee for this purpose.\nBladder cancer. Population research suggests that coffee consumption does not reduce the risk of bladder cancer.\nAlthough earlier evidence has been conflicting (97375, 97376), the most comprehensive analysis of cohort and case control studies has found that coffee consumption is not associated with bladder cancer risk. In subgroup analyses of females, males, or non-smokers, coffee did not affect risk (103992).\nless\nBrain tumor. It is unclear if consuming coffee reduces the risk of brain cancer.\nObservational research has found that consumption of coffee is associated with a lower risk of brain cancer in Asian populations, but not in American populations (100870).\nless\nBreast cancer. Population research suggests that coffee consumption does not reduce the risk of breast cancer.\nPopulation research has found that consumption of coffee is not associated with a reduced incidence of breast cancer (9235, 97377, 107823).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using rectal coffee enemas for the treatment of cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of coffee for this purpose.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Some population research has found that drinking coffee is associated with a reduced risk of heart failure, but not with a reduced risk of major adverse cardiac events, coronary heart disease, or CVD in general. In patients with a history of CVD, coffee consumption may reduce CVD-related mortality. However, at least some evidence suggests that there is a J-shaped association between coffee consumption and the risk of acute coronary syndromes.\nA meta-analysis of three large population studies, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Cardiovascular Heart Study (CHS), and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, suggests that increased daily coffee consumption is associated with a reduced long-term risk of heart failure in individuals without CVD at baseline. Drinking at least 2 cups of coffee daily is associated with a 29% to 31% reduced risk of heart failure. However, there was no association between coffee consumption and risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, or CVD in general. In the analysis, total caffeine intake, but not decaffeinated coffee intake, was associated with a reduced risk of heart failure (104597). In one cohort study, there was no association between past coffee-drinking and the prevalence of having coronary heart disease as determined by a coronary angiography (104588). However, a large population study suggests that drinking up to 5 cups daily of instant, ground, or decaffeinated coffee is associated with a reduced risk of incident CVD, including coronary heart disease, cardiac failure, and/or ischemic stroke, of approximately 11% (111033).\n\nThe association between coffee consumption and arrhythmia has also been investigated. In one population study, there was a 3% reduced risk of arrhythmia for each additional cup of habitual coffee consumed. Similar effects were seen when atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia, but not ventricular tachycardia, were independently analyzed (105310). More recent population research suggests that consuming 1-5 cups daily of ground or instant coffee, but not decaffeinated coffee, is associated with up to a 17% reduced risk of arrhythmia when compared with not consuming coffee. Intake of more than 5 cups was no longer associated with a reduced risk of arrhythmia (111033).\n\nSome population research suggests a J-shaped association between regular coffee consumption and the risk of developing acute coronary syndromes. Moderate consumption of less than 300 mL daily (about 1.3 cups) was associated with a lower risk of developing acute coronary syndromes, whereas regular consumption of 300 mL daily or more was associated with an increased risk (11318). However, other population research in people without a history of CVD suggests that drinking more than 6 cups of coffee daily does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease (14343).\n\nThe association between coffee consumption and CVD-related mortality has also been evaluated in people with CVD. Population research suggests that coffee consumption is associated with a reduction in CVD-related mortality. In some analyses, this association is for ground or decaffeinated coffee only (97373, 97374, 103997, 103998, 104594, 104595, 105308, 105311, 105314). A meta-analysis of a small number of population studies suggests that consuming coffee for at least 1 year after a myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with a small reduction in risk of CVD-related mortality and no increased risk of all-cause mortality or major cardiac events, such as a recurrent MI or stroke (104882). In patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome, including acute MI or unstable angina, consumption of 1-3 cups of coffee daily is associated with a reduced risk of overall mortality over a 4-year period, especially in never or former smokers. However, in those who are current smokers, consuming more than 3 cups daily is associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk of overall mortality (8533, 105313). A large observational study which followed patients with stable coronary artery disease for 5 years also suggests that there is no association between coffee consumption and CVD-related mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke (112735).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for the prevention or management of CKD.\nA small meta-analysis of population research has found that coffee consumption is associated with a 14% reduced incidence of CKD; drinking at least 2 cups daily seems to have the most benefit. Coffee consumption is also associated with an 18% reduced incidence of progression to kidney failure, as well as lower odds of having albuminuria. In addition, coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of CKD-related death, with at least 4 cups daily providing the most benefit when compared with drinking no coffee (104586). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneous definitions of CKD, kidney failure, and albuminuria in the individual studies, as well as the comparisons of coffee consumption.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for cognitive function.\nSome population research has found that higher lifetime coffee consumption might positively affect cognitive function among females aged 80 years or older (10620). Additionally, a small clinical study in healthy adults shows that consuming a single dose of regular coffee 220 mL containing 100 mg of caffeine improves reaction time and working memory, but not episodic memory, when compared with placebo (100864).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer.\nA meta-analysis of cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe suggests that there is no association between coffee intake and the incidence of colorectal cancer (97385). However, population research conducted in Japan and Korea suggests that drinking coffee is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, with the greatest reduction seen in patients consuming 3 or more cups of coffee daily (9222, 97384, 107832, 111041). In one study, risk reduction increased from 32% to 78% when adjusted for the use of coffee additives, including cream and sugar (107832).\n\nIn addition, drinking coffee is associated with a reduced risk of disease progression and death in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. Each additional cup daily is associated with a 5% reduced risk of cancer progression and a 7% reduced risk of death. The greatest benefits were associated with drinking at least 4 cups daily when compared with no coffee consumption (104591).\nless\nConstipation. Although there has been interest in consuming coffee for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of coffee for this purpose.\nDementia. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for preventing dementia.\nOne meta-analysis of observational studies including nearly 329,000 adults has found that drinking coffee is not associated with a lower risk of dementia or Alzheimer disease (100866). Conversely, other observational research has found evidence of benefit, but results are conflicting. A meta-analysis of observational studies in nearly 334,000 adults has found a reduced risk of any cognitive deficit (including mild cognitive impairment and dementia) or dementia alone in those drinking less than 2.8 or 2.3 cups of coffee daily, respectively, when compared with not drinking coffee (107829). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of discussion of heterogeneity and variability in sensitivity analyses. An individual observational study in nearly 14,000 adults has found that coffee and caffeine consumption is associated with dose-dependent reductions in dementia risk, especially in males, and that drinking at least 3 cups of coffee daily is associated with a 50% lower risk of dementia when compared with not drinking coffee (107841).\n\nCoffee consumption has also been studied in combination with tea. An observational study has found that drinking 0.5-1 cup of coffee with at least 4 cups of tea or 2-3 cups of coffee and tea each daily is associated with a 28% to 30% reduced risk of dementia when compared with not drinking coffee and tea (107204).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for reducing the risk of depression.\nObservational research has found that higher coffee consumption is associated with a 24% lower risk of depression when compared with lower coffee consumption. Drinking 400-600 mL of coffee daily is associated with 16% lower risk of depression when compared with not consuming coffee (100863).\nless\nEndometrial cancer. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for the prevention of endometrial cancer; the available research is conflicting.\nOne meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies suggests that drinking coffee is associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the risk of endometrial cancer. Increasing coffee consumption by 4 cups daily is associated with a 20% reduction in endometrial cancer risk (97381). Another meta-analysis of population research suggests that the highest intake of caffeinated coffee, but not decaffeinated coffee, is associated with a 34% reduced risk of endometrial cancer when compared with the lowest. A sub-analysis suggests that this association is limited to individuals with a high body mass index (111036). In contrast, earlier meta-analyses and one large prospective cohort study conducted in the United Kingdom suggests that drinking coffee is not associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer in general; however, there may be some protection in obese females drinking at least 2 cups of caffeinated coffee daily (93873, 97381, 97382).\nless\nFractures. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for fracture prevention.\nMultiple meta-analyses of observational research suggest that the highest intake of coffee is not associated with a difference in the odds of fracture when compared with the lowest intake. However, any association may be dependent on the dose of coffee and/or the location of research (111034, 112734). A dose-response analysis in one meta-analysis suggests that consuming 0.5 to 4 cups daily, but not higher amounts, is associated with a small reduction in the incidence of hip fracture when compared with no coffee consumption. Additional sub-analyses suggest that while the highest coffee consumption was associated with a 25% reduced risk of fracture in studies conducted in Europe and North America, the opposite is true in studies conducted in Asia where the risk is increased by 37% (111034).\nless\nGallbladder disease. Population research suggests that consuming coffee may reduce the risk of developing symptomatic gallstone disease.\nPopulation research has found that the consumption of caffeinated beverages, including coffee, that provide at least 400 mg of caffeine (two or more cups of coffee) daily is associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing symptomatic gallstone disease (3345, 8032). The effect seems to be dose-dependent; consumption of 800 mg caffeine (four or more cups of coffee) daily is associated with the greatest reduction in risk (3345).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if consuming coffee reduces the risk of gastric cancer.\nOverall, meta-analyses of observational research suggest that coffee consumption does not affect gastric cancer risk. However, subgroup analyses of patients living in the United States suggest that consuming coffee is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer (100873, 111038). One sub-analysis suggests that consuming 6.5 or more cups of coffee daily was associated with a 36% greater risk of gastric cancer (100873).\nless\nGout. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for preventing gout.\nEpidemiological research has found that the risk of developing gout over a 12-year period is 40% lower in males aged 40-75 years who drink 4-5 cups of caffeinated coffee daily, compared with those who don't drink coffee. In people who drink 6 cups or more daily, the risk of developing gout is 59% lower. Drinking decaffeinated coffee is also associated with a reduced risk of developing gout, but the risk reduction is more modest than with caffeinated coffee (15540).\nless\nHeadache. Although caffeine is an established treatment for certain types of headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of coffee, specifically, for this purpose.\nHearing loss. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for hearing loss.\nPopulation research has found that consuming at least one cup of coffee daily is associated with a reduced risk of hearing impairment in males, but not females, when compared with less than one cup of coffee daily. In males, each additional cup consumed daily was associated with a 15% lower risk of hearing impairment (104592).\nless\nHepatitis B. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for hepatitis B.\nPopulation research in patients being treated for chronic hepatitis B suggests that drinking at least 3 cups of coffee a day is associated with a reduced risk of having liver fibrosis when compared to not consuming coffee. However, this association was not present in untreated patients (111044). This study is limited by its cross-sectional design and use of blood markers, rather than the gold standard liver biopsy, for diagnosing fibrosis.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if consuming caffeinated coffee is beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of small, randomized, controlled trials shows that consuming caffeinated coffee for up to about 11 weeks reduces total cholesterol by 8 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 13 mg/dL when compared with a control group. These effects appear to be dose-dependent, with the greatest reduction observed in individuals consuming 6-8 cups of coffee daily. Every additional cup of caffeinated coffee consumed daily is associated with a 3-4 mg/dL additional reduction in total and LDL cholesterol and a 6-7 mg/dL additional reduction in triglyceride levels. Decaffeinated coffee had no effect on any markers of cholesterol (97370). However, population research has found that coffee consumption is associated with slightly higher total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared with no coffee consumption (104590).\nless\nHypertension. Epidemiologic research suggests that consuming coffee reduces the risk of developing hypertension.\nSome epidemiological research suggests that coffee consumption might reduce the risk of developing hypertension. A meta-analysis of epidemiologic research suggests that long-term coffee intake is associated with a modest 9% reduction in the risk of developing hypertension. However, smoking may diminish any potential benefit (97372). This analysis did not investigate the likelihood of a dose-response relationship and did not adjust for smoking status. Another epidemiologic study in a Brazilian population that did adjust for sociodemographic factors such as smoking suggests that drinking 1-3 cups of coffee daily is associated with a reduced risk of hypertension by about 18% when compared with never or almost never drinking coffee. Drinking more than 3 cups of coffee did not impact risk (103993). However, this study defined 1 cup of coffee as 50 mL; it is unclear how this intake compares with typical use in other countries. The best evidence comes from a meta-analysis of observational research which suggests that coffee intake was not associated with hypertension risk. However, coffee intake was associated with a modest reduction in hypertension risk in studies conducted in the United States (111037).\n\nIn patients with hypertension, a meta-analysis of epidemiologic research suggests that habitual coffee intake is not associated with the risk of developing CVD (105312). However, other prospective population research in patients with severe hypertension, but not mild hypertension, suggests that drinking at least two cups of coffee daily is associated with a 2-fold increase in CVD mortality compared with non-coffee drinkers (111027).\nless\nHypotension. It is unclear if consuming caffeinated coffee is beneficial in older adults with postprandial hypotension.\nPreliminary clinical research in older adults with postprandial hypotension shows that consuming caffeinated beverages like coffee seems to increase blood pressure (11835).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for preventing IBS.\nA meta-analysis of mostly small, low-quality, observational and population research suggests that coffee consumption is associated with a modestly lower odds of developing IBS when compared with no coffee consumption. However, the validity of this result is limited by high heterogeneity (112739).\nless\nKidney failure. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for preventing progression to kidney failure or reducing the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related death.\nA small meta-analysis of population research has found that coffee consumption is associated with an 18% reduced incidence of progression from CKD to kidney failure. Coffee consumption is also associated with a reduced risk of CKD-related death, with at least 4 cups daily providing the most benefit when compared with not drinking coffee (104586). This analysis is limited by the heterogeneous definitions of CKD and kidney failure in the individual studies, as well as the comparisons of coffee consumption.\nless\nLiver cancer. It is unclear if consuming coffee reduces the risk of liver cancer.\nA meta-analysis of observational research in approximately 2.5 million adults in Asia, North America, and Europe suggests that consuming at least 1 cup of coffee daily is associated with a 27% to 48% reduced risk of liver cancer (111016). An earlier meta-analysis of observational research suggests that regular coffee consumption is associated with a 31% lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with no consumption. Higher coffee consumption seems to have a greater preventative effect when compared with lower coffee consumption (103989).\nless\nLiver disease. It is unclear if consuming coffee reduces the risk of chronic liver disease.\nObservational research has found that regular coffee consumption is associated with a 38% lower risk of chronic liver disease when compared with no consumption. Higher coffee consumption seems to have a greater preventative effect when compared with lower coffee consumption (100862).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if consuming caffeinated coffee reduces the risk of lung cancer; the available research is conflicting.\nEpidemiological research has found that males who consume a higher amount of dietary phytoestrogens, such as the lignan precursors found in coffee and tea, have up to a 27% lower risk of developing lung cancer when compared with those who consume smaller amounts (13190). However, conflicting evidence suggests that people who consume 2-4 or more cups of caffeinated coffee daily have a significantly increased risk of developing lung cancer (13191, 90177). But drinking decaffeinated coffee seems to be associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer (13191).\nless\nMelanoma. It is unclear if consuming coffee reduces the risk of malignant melanoma.\nPopulation research has found that high coffee intake is associated with a 19% to 25% reduction in the risk of malignant melanoma when compared with low consumption. However, after adjusting for confounders, most data show no significant reduction. Drinking decaffeinated coffee is not associated with a reduced incidence of malignant melanoma (97378, 97379).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It unclear if consuming decaffeinated coffee is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA meta-analysis of mostly small randomized controlled studies in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that consumption of decaffeinated coffee modestly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with control. The validity of these findings is limited by the high heterogeneity and small size of the included studies (107830).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Observational research suggests that consuming coffee may reduce the risk of NAFLD. Observational and clinical research on liver fibrosis is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of observational research in over 50,000 patients has found that drinking 1-2 cups of coffee daily does not affect NAFLD incidence when compared with drinking less than 1 cup of coffee. However, drinking more than 3 cups of coffee daily was associated with a reduced risk of NAFLD when compared with less than 2 cups daily (103990). Other observational research has found a reduced risk of NAFLD and/or fibrosis in those who drink coffee when compared with those who do not drink coffee (100872, 107831). However, the validity of these findings is limited by a relatively small population size and the lack of dose-response analyses.\n\nTwo of the primary bioactive constituents of coffee, caffeine and chlorogenic acid, also have been evaluated. A small study in patients with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes shows that taking caffeine 200 mg and/or chlorogenic acid 200 mg for 6 months has no effect on the reduction of hepatic fat and fibrosis when compared with placebo (107835).\nless\nNonmelanoma skin cancer. It is unclear if consuming caffeinated coffee reduces the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer.\nPopulation research has found that the highest intake of coffee or caffeine is associated with an 18% reduction in nonmelanoma skin cancer risk when compared with the lowest intake. However, the benefit appears to be limited to the incidence of basal cell carcinoma. Drinking decaffeinated coffee is not associated with a reduced incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer. The effect, if any, appears to be due to caffeine rather than coffee (97380).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for weight loss in patients who are overweight or obese; the available research is conflicting.\nSome clinical research in males who are overweight or obese and are receiving dietary counseling shows that taking coffee mannooligosaccharides 2 grams twice daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight by 6%, compared with 2.3% with placebo. The product also reduces body fat in males, but not females (93877). Additional clinical research in patients with pre-obesity shows that drinking a dark roast coffee 500 mL daily, enriched with N-methylpyridinium ions, for 4 weeks results in weight loss of 3.5%, compared with 0% with a light roast coffee enriched in chlorogenic acids. The dark roast coffee appears to reduce caloric intake (93874). However, other clinical research in adults who are overweight or obese shows that drinking caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee 885 mL daily for 8 weeks does not appear to improve glycemic control or reduce weight (93879).\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for osteoporosis prevention.\nA meta-analysis of observational research suggests that the highest coffee consumption is associated with a 21% reduced odds of osteoporosis when compared with the lowest (111034).\nless\nPancreatitis. It is unclear if consuming coffee reduces the risk of pancreatitis.\nObservational research has found that drinking three or more cups of coffee daily is associated with a 22% lower risk of pancreatitis when compared with drinking less coffee (100871).\nless\nPharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if consuming coffee reduces the risk of pharyngeal cancer.\nObservational research has found that high coffee consumption is associated with a 28% reduced odds of pharyngeal cancer when compared with low coffee consumption (100869).\nless\nPneumonia. It is unclear if consuming coffee is beneficial for reducing the risk of pneumonia.\nA case-control study in elderly patients has found a 50% reduced risk of pneumonia in those consuming 2 or more cups of coffee daily over the past month (107840). The validity of this finding may be limited by differences in the baseline characteristics between the matched control subjects and the cases, specifically the higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in the control group.\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if consuming coffee reduces the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension.\nA large prospective cohort study in pregnant patients in Japan has found that the highest total caffeine intake is associated with a 26% increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension when compared with no intake, but that a higher coffee intake (at least 2 cups daily) is associated with a 21% reduced risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension when compared with no intake, even when adjusted for total caffeine intake (107827). The validity of these findings may be limited by the fact that detailed information on proteinuria and hypertension were unavailable.\nless\nProstate cancer. Population research has found that coffee consumption is associated with a modestly reduced risk of prostate cancer.\nAlthough some individual studies disagree (107834), population research has found that the highest coffee consumption is associated with a small reduction in the risk of prostate cancer when compared with the lowest consumption (97383, 97384, 104587). Sub-analyses show that coffee consumption is associated with a 7% reduced risk of localized, but not advanced or fatal, prostate cancer (97383, 97384, 104587).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if coffee consumption, alone or in combination with tea, is beneficial for stroke, post-stroke dementia, all-cause mortality, or stroke-related mortality. The available research is conflicting. Details: Several meta-analyses of population research in patients with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD) have found no association between coffee consumption and risk of stroke (104597, 104882). However, another meta-analysis of population research and an individual observational study have found that coffee consumption (e.g., 2-3 cups of coffee daily) is associated with an 8% to 12% reduced risk of stroke, especially ischemic stroke, when compared with no consumption (107204, 107828). The validity of the findings from the meta-analysis is limited by the lack of a dose-response analysis. Additionally, this analysis found that consumption of 2-3 cups of coffee daily is associated with a 20% reduced risk of post-stroke dementia when compared with not drinking coffee (107204).\nThe consumption of coffee in combination with tea has also been evaluated. An observational study has found that consumption of 2-3 cups daily each of coffee and tea, including black tea, is associated with a 32% reduced risk of stroke when compared with not drinking coffee and tea. Additionally, consumption of 0.5-1 cup of coffee and 2-3 cups of tea, including black tea, daily is associated with a 50% reduced risk of post-stroke dementia when compared with not drinking coffee and tea (107204).\n\nCoffee consumption has also been evaluated for its effects on stroke-related and all-cause mortality. One observational study has found that consumption of 1-2 cups of coffee daily is associated with a 50% reduced risk of stroke-related mortality (107822). However, another observational study in patients with a history of stroke has found no association between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality (107839).\nless\nThyroid cancer. It is unclear if consuming coffee reduces the risk of thyroid cancer.\nPopulation research has found that high coffee consumption is associated with a 25% lower risk of thyroid cancer when compared with low consumption. Every additional cup of coffee was associated with a 5% reduction in risk (103996).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate coffee for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nCoffee is most often consumed in amounts of about 2 cups, or 250 mg of caffeine, daily. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nThe choice of coffee, grind, ratio of coffee to water, and other factors determine the flavor and strength of the beverage. A 6-ounce cup of coffee contains approximately 60-120 mg of caffeine (8042). However, caffeine levels depend on how the coffee is made. Per average cup, percolated coffee contains 100-150 mg caffeine, instant coffee contains 85-100 mg caffeine, and decaffeinated coffee contains approximately 8 mg caffeine. Darker roasts contain less caffeine due to sublimation during roasting (13).",
            "Interactions with Drugs": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nADENOSINE (Adenocard)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, coffee might decrease the vasodilatory effects of adenosine and interfere with its use prior to stress testing.\nCoffee contains caffeine. Caffeine is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine at the cellular level (38172). However, caffeine does not seem to affect supplemental adenosine because high interstitial levels of adenosine overcome the antagonistic effects of caffeine (11771). It is recommended that methylxanthines such as caffeine, as well as methylxanthine-containing products, be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing (11771).\nless\nALCOHOL (Ethanol)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, alcohol might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nCoffee contains caffeine. Concomitant use of alcohol and caffeine can increase caffeine serum concentrations and the risk of caffeine adverse effects. Alcohol reduces caffeine metabolism (6370, 24693).\nless\nALENDRONATE (Fosamax)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonquantitative systematic review)\nCoffee reduces alendronate bioavailability.\nSeparate coffee ingestion and alendronate administration by two hours. Coffee reduces alendronate bioavailability by 60% (11735).\nless\nANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, coffee may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs.\nCoffee contains caffeine. Caffeine is reported to have antiplatelet activity (8028, 8029). Theoretically, the caffeine in coffee might increase the risk of bleeding when used concomitantly with these agents. However, this interaction has not been reported in humans. There is some evidence that caffeinated coffee might increase the fibrinolytic activity in blood (8030).\nless\nANTIDIABETES DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, concomitant use of coffee and antidiabetes drugs might interfere with blood glucose control.\nCoffee contains caffeine. Reports claim that caffeine might increase or decrease blood sugar levels (6024, 8646).\nless\nBETA-ADRENERGIC AGONISTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, concomitant use of large amounts of coffee might increase cardiac inotropic effects of beta-agonists.\nCoffee contains caffeine. Caffeine can increase cardiac inotropic effects of beta-agonists (15).\nless\nCIMETIDINE (Tagamet)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, cimetidine might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine in coffee.\nCoffee contains caffeine. Cimetidine can reduce caffeine clearance by 31% to 42% (11736, 24700).\nless\nCLOZAPINE (Clozaril)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, coffee might increase the levels and adverse effects of clozapine and acutely exacerbate psychotic symptoms.\nCoffee contains caffeine. Caffeine can increase the effects and toxicity of clozapine. Caffeine doses of 400-1000 mg daily inhibit clozapine metabolism (5051). Clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Researchers speculate that caffeine might inhibit CYP1A2. However, there is no reliable evidence that caffeine affects CYP1A2. There is also speculation that genetic factors might make some patients be more sensitive to the interaction between clozapine and caffeine (13741).\nless\nCONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine found in coffee.\nCoffee contains caffeine.

Caffeine is a methylxyanthine that may inhibit dipyridamole-induced vasodilation (11770, 11772, 24974, 37985, 53795). It is recommended that methylxanthines such as caffeine, as well as methylxanthine-containing products such as coffee, be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). Methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing (11771).\nless\nDISULFIRAM (Antabuse)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, disulfiram might increase the risk of adverse effects from caffeine.\nCoffee contains caffeine.

Each additional cup of coffee reduced the AUC and Cmax by 4% and 3%, respectively. It is unclear whether this interaction is due to induction of lamotrigine metabolism or inhibition of lamotrigine absorption (107837).\nless\nLEVOTHYROXINE (Synthroid, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nCoffee can reduce the absorption of levothyroxine.\nIn some patients, coffee can reduce levothyroxine absorption, possibly through the formation of non-absorbable complexes. A pharmacokinetic study in these patients found that 25-30 mL of espresso coffee consumed with levothyroxine tablets delayed the time to peak plasma levels by 38-43 minutes, reduced the peak plasma level (Cmax) by 19% to 36%, and reduced the area under the curve (AUC) by 27% to 36%. Coffee consumed one hour after levothyroxine did not affect absorption (16401). It is not known whether this interaction occurs with other types of coffee.

Caffeine has been shown to inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B in laboratory studies (37724, 37877, 37912, 38108). Concomitant intake of large amounts of caffeine with MAOIs might precipitate a hypertensive crisis (15).

Cordyceps can speed up the clearance of caffeine from the body by inducing cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) (24986).\nless\nCREATINE\nTheoretically, concomitant use may increase the risk of serious adverse effects.\nCoffee contains caffeine. There is some concern that combining caffeine ephedra, and creatine might increase the risk of serious adverse effects. There is a report of ischemic stroke in an athlete who consumed creatine monohydrate 6 grams, caffeine 400-600 mg, ephedra 40-60 mg, and a variety of other supplements daily for 6 weeks (1275). Caffeine might also decrease creatine's'possible beneficial effects on athletic performance. Some researchers think caffeine can inhibit phosphocreatine resynthesis (2117, 4575).\nless\nECHINACEA\nTheoretically, echinacea might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nCoffee contains caffeine. In healthy individuals, taking echinacea 400 mg daily for 8 days seems to inhibit the oral clearance of caffeine (23581). This effect seems to be due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, which is involved in caffeine metabolism.\nless\nEPHEDRA (Ma huang)\nConcomitant use increases the risk of adverse stimulant effects.\nCoffee contains caffeine. There is evidence that using ephedra with caffeine might increase the risk of serious life-threatening or debilitating adverse effects such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, seizures, and death (1275, 6486, 9740, 10307).

Use with caution.\nless\nBLEEDING DISORDERS\nTheoretically, caffeine in coffee might aggravate bleeding conditions. Caffeine is reported to have antiplatelet activity (8028, 8029), although this interaction has not been reported in humans.

However, most research suggests that consuming coffee actually reduces the risk for CVD-related mortality in those with or without a history of CVD or acute coronary syndromes (104597, 104882). However, smokers with CVD may be at increased risk for complications. One observational study shows that, in current smokers with a history of acute coronary syndrome, consuming more than 3 cups daily is associated with more than a two-fold increased risk of overall mortality (105313).\nless\nDIABETES\nCoffee contains caffeine, which has been reported to have variable effects on glycemic control. Some research suggests that caffeine contained in coffee might impair postprandial glucose metabolism in people with diabetes and contribute to insulin resistance. The effect of caffeinated beverages and herbs has not been studied (12374, 12375). The caffeine in coffee may enhance the frequency and intensity of hypoglycemic warning symptoms in patients with type 1 diabetes. Theoretically, this may increase the ability of diabetics to detect and treat hypoglycemia early. However, it might also increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740). Caffeine has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose (8646). Use with caution.\nless\nDIARRHEA\nCoffee contains caffeine, which can exacerbate diarrhea, especially when taken in large amounts (100523). Use with caution.\nless\nEPILEPSY\nCoffee contains caffeine. Patients with epilepsy should avoid using high doses of caffeine; low doses should be used with caution. Some animal research indicates that high doses of caffeine can significantly reduce seizure threshold or induce seizures (23559, 23560, 23561). Furthermore, caffeine seems to decrease the activity of various anticonvulsant drugs, including carbamazepine, ethosuximide, felbamate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate (23558, 23559, 23560, 23561, 23562, 23563).

However, caffeine does not seem to affect the anticonvulsant effects of tiagabine or oxcarbazepine (23561).\nless\nGLAUCOMA\nDrinking caffeinated coffee increases intraocular pressure. The increase occurs within 30 minutes and persists for at least 90 minutes (8540, 91056). Use with caution in patients with glaucoma.\nless\nHYPERTENSION\nShort-term caffeinated coffee consumption can temporarily increase blood pressure. Usually, increases in blood pressure occur 30 minutes after ingestion, peak in 1-2 hours, and may last for over 4 hours (36539, 37732, 37989, 38000, 38300, 105312). Increases are generally small and not clinically significant, being less than the normal diurnal variation in blood pressure (98806). Regular consumption of caffeinated coffee does not seem to increase blood pressure even in hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722, 38335, 105312). Caffeinated coffee consumption does not increase the risk of developing chronic hypertension (38190).\nless\nINCONTINENCE\nCoffee contains caffeine, which acts as a diuretic. Caffeine intake of more than 400 mg daily worsened detrusor instability (urge incontinency) in older females (36346). Increasing caffeine intake worsens symptoms of urinary incontinence, such as urinary frequency and urgency (36382).

Some sources suggest that caffeinated coffee consumption should be limited to approximately 2-3 cups of coffee daily, unless there is adequate calcium supplementation to compensate for calcium losses (2669, 10202, 11317). However, according to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analyses of mostly observational research conducted in the US and Europe, healthy adults with adequate or undetermined calcium intake are not at increased risk for decreased bone mineral density, osteoporosis, or fractures with daily coffee intake or daily caffeine intake equivalent to approximately 4 cups of caffeinated coffee (11733, 98806, 100867, 100868, 111034). Postmenopausal adults identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to have an 8% higher risk for bone loss from caffeine and should use caffeine with caution (2669).\nless\nSMOKING\nTheoretically, consuming coffee might increase the risk of mortality in current or past smokers. In current smokers, consumption of each additional cup of coffee daily is associated with an increased risk of cancer-related mortality (105308).

The caffeine in coffee is a competitive antagonist for adenosine receptors (11771). It is recommended that caffeine and caffeine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, caffeine appears more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine (Adenocard) stress testing (11771). The interaction between caffeine and dipyridamole is unlikely to be significant in stress testing if the heart rate increase is greater than 5% after dipyridamole infusion (11772). Additionally, clinical research shows that caffeine 200 mg and 400 mg given 90 minutes before stress testing significantly impairs the ability of regadenoson, an adenosine receptor agonist, to detect existing ischemia (91083).\nless\nPHEOCHROMOCYTOMA TESTS\nCoffee contains caffeine, which can increase urine catecholamine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) concentrations (15). and might cause false-positive diagnosis of pheochromocytoma when diagnosis is based on tests of urine VMA or catecholamine concentrations.\nless\nPULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS\nPeople may need to avoid caffeine and caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, for at least 4 hours prior to lung function testing.

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nThe fatal acute oral dose of caffeine in adults is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg/kg), although fatality has occurred at lower doses (11832, 37908, 37925, 38228, 38229, 91025, 91052, 91070, 97454). In fatal caffeine overdose, the cause of death is usually ventricular fibrillation (11838, 97454). Additional findings on autopsy after fatal overdose have identified acute cardiopulmonary failure and extensive congestion of the internal organs (95956). Combining ephedra with coffee can increase the risk of adverse effects, due to the caffeine contained in coffee. Hospitalization requiring life support has been associated with the combined use of ephedra and caffeine (2729).\n\nRectally, coffee enemas have been associated with multiple deaths. Some of these deaths are related to severe electrolyte imbalance; others are associated with polymicrobial septicemia following use of coffee enema (3026, 3347, 3349, 6652).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose from coffee.",

Urinary levels depend on levels in the specific roast types (93874).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of coffee is the bean. Coffee contains 1% to 2% caffeine (11845), which is the primary active ingredient. A 6-ounce cup of coffee contains approximately 60-120 mg of caffeine (8042). However, caffeine levels depend on how the coffee is made. Per average cup, percolated coffee contains 100-150 mg caffeine, instant coffee contains 85-100 mg caffeine, and decaffeinated coffee contains approximately 8 mg caffeine. Darker roasts contain less caffeine due to sublimation during roasting (13). Other active constituents include chlorogenic acid, caffeol, and diterpenes (8033). Coffee also contains polyphenols including the phytoestrogens formononetin and the lignan precursor secoisolariciresinol (13190, 13191). Some coffee products may be contaminated with ochratoxin A, a mycotoxin. Levels of ochratoxin A range from 0.35-79 mcg/kg in coffee and coffee-based products. Levels seem to be related to the average amount of rainfall, which increases the risk of fungal growth (105309).\nAnti-cancer effects\nGreen coffee beans contain high levels of antioxidant polyphenols, which are thought to be antitumorigenic. Most of these polyphenols are destroyed during the roasting process. Some researchers have reported that a new roasting process maintains higher levels of polyphenols without affecting the flavor. They theorize that such coffee might be healthier to drink (6601); however, this has not been demonstrated in clinical research. Drinking coffee containing antioxidants increases activity of antioxidant enzymes in human research (93874).\nAnti-gout effects\nDrinking coffee has been associated with a decreased risk of gout. Some evidence shows that coffee intake is inversely related to serum uric acid levels and the incidence of gout. The specific ingredient of coffee responsible for this effect is not known. A link between insulin resistance and hyperuricemia has been reported, and it has been theorized that beneficial effects of coffee on insulin resistance may also contribute to a protective effect against gout (15540).\nCardiovascular effects\nCoffee has properties that might be beneficial in preventing cardiovascular disease and others that might increase risk. There is evidence that caffeine prevents platelet aggregation and that coffee containing caffeine increases the fibrinolytic activity in blood (8029, 8030). However, diterpene constituents in unfiltered coffee such as cafestol and kahweol are believed to increase serum cholesterol, which may increase cardiovascular disease risk (1353). Cafestol is also thought to increase triglyceride levels by increasing the production of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles which subsequently can cause a rise in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (8037). There is also evidence the constituent chlorogenic acid in coffee raises homocysteine levels (8035).\nCNS effects\nThe caffeine constituent acts as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, increases heart rate and contractility, increases blood pressure, stimulates gastric acid secretion, causes diuresis, relaxes extracerebral vascular and bronchial smooth muscle, and stimulates the release of catecholamines (8033).\nDiabetes effects\nEpidemiological research suggests that drinking coffee might reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The mechanism for this observed effect is unknown, but several constituents of coffee might have an effect on glucose regulation. Chlorogenic acid in coffee might inhibit glucose-6-phosphatase, which might lower hepatic glucose production. Antioxidants in coffee might improve insulin sensitivity. Caffeine seems to stimulate pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin. But a small meta-analysis of studies mostly in patients without diabetes having a weight ranging from healthy to obese has found that coffee consumption is not associated with changes in insulin sensitivity or resistance (107824). Coffee also contains magnesium and phytoestrogens, both of which have been associated with a beneficial effect on diabetes risk (11731, 11732).\n\nHowever, some research suggests that the caffeine in coffee might have an adverse effect on diabetes. In people with type 2 diabetes, acute administration of caffeine impairs postprandial glucose metabolism, while acute abstention from caffeine reduces postprandial glucose levels by 21%. Whether these effects also occur with caffeinated beverages and herbs is unknown (12374). Some Other research in obese people suggests that caffeine ingestion may contribute to insulin resistance (12375, 13744).\n\nIn human research, drinking coffee does not improve glycemic control in overweight or obese individuals. However, drinking caffeinated coffee improves levels of interleukin-6 and adiponectin, markers of inflammation and adipocyte activity, respectively, and decaffeinated coffee improves levels of fetuin-A, a marker of liver health. Changes in adiponectin appear to be related to glycemic control (93879).\nGallbladder effects\nCoffee might have a protective effect on the gallbladder. It seems to enhance gallbladder contractility, stimulate cholecystokinin (CCK) release, and increase colonic motility, which might lower the risk of gallstone disease (3345). Proponents of caffeinated coffee enemas believe that caffeine is absorbed into the portal circulation, causing dilation of the bile ducts and stimulation of hepatocellular function to detoxify tumor cell metabolism products. However, these claims have not been substantiated (3026, 3346, 3347, 6653).\nWeight loss effects\nMannooligosaccharides found in coffee might decrease both visceral and subcutaneous fat by increasing fat excretion. These compounds appear to increase laxation frequency and fecal fat. Laboratory research suggests that mannooligosaccharides might also increase the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) during intestinal fermentation, possibly improving metabolism of lipids and glycemic control (93877)."

    "Cola Nut": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Cola nut is a seed found in the pods of Cola trees grown and cultivated in tropical areas of Africa, South America, and the West Indies (57678, 94049, 94050, 94051, 94052). Cola nuts are used for medicinal purposes and in religious and social customs (11963, 94049, 94050, 94051, 94052). Traditionally, cola nut has been used for various purposes, including migraine headache, diarrhea, and fatigue.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used in amounts commonly found in foods. Cola nut extract has Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status in the US (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Cola nut has been used with apparent safety for up to 12 weeks (12811).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally, long-term, or in large amounts. Chewing cola nut is associated with an increased risk of mouth cancer and gastrointestinal cancer (11963). Cola nut also contains caffeine. Chronic use of caffeine, especially in large amounts, can sometimes produce tolerance, habituation, and psychological dependence (3719). Acute use of high doses, typically above 400 mg daily, has been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmia and sleep disturbances (11832). Abrupt discontinuance of caffeine can cause physical withdrawal symptoms (11733). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as cola nut, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in amounts found in foods. Due to the caffeine content of cola nut, pregnant patients should closely monitor their intake to ensure moderate consumption. Fetal blood concentrations of caffeine approximate maternal concentrations (4260). The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects (2708, 2709, 2710, 2711, 9606, 11733, 16014, 16015). In some studies, consuming amounts over 200 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage (16014). This increased risk may be most likely to occur in those with genotypes that confer a slow rate of caffeine metabolism (98806). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, most healthy pregnant patients can safely consume caffeine in doses up to 300 mg daily without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations (11733, 98806). Advise keeping caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 3 cups of coffee or tea. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as cola nut, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when caffeine, a constituent of cola nut, is used orally in amounts over 300 mg daily. Caffeine crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels (4260). Advise keeping caffeine consumption from all sources below 300 mg daily (2708). High doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants (9891). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight (2709, 2711, 91033, 91048, 95949). Keep in mind that only the amount of added caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as cola nut, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. In a study that included 2 large cohorts of mother/infant pairs, the first cohort with a median maternal plasma caffeine level of 168.5 ng/mL (range 29.5-650.5 ng/mL) during pregnancy, suggests birth weights and lengths were lower in the 4th quartile of caffeine intake compared with the 1st. By age 7, heights and weights were lower by 1.5 cm and 1.1 kg, respectively. In the second cohort of mother/infant pairs with higher maternal pregnancy plasma caffeine levels, median 625.5 ng/mL (range 86.2 to 1994.7 ng/mL), heights at age 8 were 2.2 cm lower, but there was no difference in weights (109846).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in amounts found in foods. Due to the caffeine content of cola nut, caffeine intake should be closely monitored while nursing. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of maternal serum concentrations. Minimal consumption would likely result in limited exposure to a nursing infant (9892).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Consumption of cola nut might cause sleep disturbances, irritability, and increased bowel activity in nursing infants due to its caffeine content (6026). Large doses or excessive intake of cola nut should be avoided during lactation. It is unknown whether potentially carcinogenic constituents of cola nut are transferred via breast milk.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, cola nut is well tolerated when eaten in the amounts found in food. It seems to be well tolerated when used medicinally and appropriately, short-term. However, the caffeine found in cola nut may cause adverse effects when taken in large amounts.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Dyspepsia, skin discoloration.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Increased risk of oral cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and West African crystalline retinopathy with long-term use.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, acute administration of caffeine can cause increased blood pressure. However, regular consumption of caffeine does not seem to increase either blood pressure or pulse, even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722). Epidemiological research suggests there is no association of caffeine consumption with incidence of hypertension (38190). Habitual coffee consumption also doesn't seem to be related to hypertension, but habitual consumption of sugared or diet cola is associated with development of hypertension (13739).\n\nEpidemiological research has also found that regular caffeine intake of up to 400 mg daily is not associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (38018, 38076, 91028, 91034, 97451, 97453), atherosclerosis (38033), cardiac ectopy (91127), stroke (37804), ventricular arrhythmia (95948, 97453), or cardiovascular disease in general (37805, 98806).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, chewing cola nut has been reported to cause bright yellow skin pigmentation (57680).\nless\nEndocrine\nSome evidence shows that caffeine, which is found in cola nut, is associated with fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer, and endometriosis; however, this is controversial since findings are conflicting (8043). Restricting caffeine in people with fibrocystic breast conditions doesn't seem to affect breast nodularity, swelling, or pain (8996). Also, a population analysis of the Women's Health Initiative observational study has found no association between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors (108806). Also, a dose-response analysis of two low-quality observational studies has found that high consumption of caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (108807).\n\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that increased consumption of caffeine results in increased insulin resistance (91023).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, cola nut may induce gastric acid secretion and cause dyspepsia and peptic ulceration (57672, 57674, 57683). The caffeine found in cola nut may cause feeding intolerance and gastrointestinal irritation in infants (6023).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, the caffeine in cola nut may increase voiding, give a sense of urgency, and irritate the bladder (37874, 37961, 104580). In males with lower urinary tract symptoms, caffeine intake increased the risk of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (38115).\nless\nImmunologic\nCola nut contains caffeine. Caffeine can cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals, although true IgE-mediated caffeine allergy seems to be relatively rare (11315).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nCola nut contains caffeine. Epidemiological evidence regarding the relationship between caffeine use and the risk for osteoporosis is contradictory. Caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium (2669, 10202, 11317). Females identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to be at an increased risk for the detrimental effect of caffeine on bone mass (2669). However, moderate caffeine intake of less than 400 mg daily does not seem to significantly increase osteoporosis risk in most postmenopausal adults with normal calcium intake (2669, 6025, 10202, 11317, 98806).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, cola nut may prolong sleep latencies and suppress REM and 3rd and 4th stages of sleep (57697). Cola nut has also been reported to cause insomnia in children (10755) and may exacerbate sleep disturbances in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (10204). Caffeine, a constituent of cola nut, can cause headaches, anxiety, jitteriness, restlessness, and nervousness (36466, 37694, 37755, 37806, 37865, 37830, 37889, 38223, 95952).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, cola nut has been associated with an increased risk for West African crystalline retinopathy in one retrospective, observational case series (57667).\n\nCola nut contains caffeine. In individuals with glaucoma, caffeine intake has been found to increase intraocular pressure. This did not occur in patients without glaucoma (36462, 36464, 36465, 37670). The magnitude of this effect seems to depend on individual tolerance to caffeine. Some research in healthy young adults shows that caffeine increases intraocular pressure to a greater degree in low-consumers of caffeine (i.e., 1 cup of coffee or less daily) when compared to high-consumers (i.e., those consuming 2 cups of coffee or more daily) (100371). The peak increase of intraocular pressure seems to occur at about 1.5 hours after caffeine ingestion, and there is no notable effect 4 hours after ingestion (36462, 100371).\nless\nOncologic\nOrally, chewing cola nut has been associated with an increased risk of oral and gastrointestinal cancer. Cola nut contains high amounts of tannins and N-nitroso compounds, which are carcinogenic. The risk may be even higher in smokers (11963).\nless\nPsychiatric\nCola nut contains caffeine. Caffeine may lead to habituation and physical dependence with amounts as low as 100 mg daily (36353, 36355). Higher doses of caffeine have caused nervousness, agitation, anxiety, irritability, delirium, depression, sleep disturbances, impaired attention, psychosis, and panic attacks (36505, 37717, 37818, 37839, 37857, 37982, 38004, 38017, 38028, 38072). Abrupt discontinuation of caffeine may result in physical withdrawal symptoms, including headache, fatigue, drowsiness, decreased physical energy, difficulty concentrating, depression, anxiety, irritability, and reduced alertness (13738).\nless",

Oral cola nut has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in overweight and obese adults shows that taking cola nut 1500 mg daily for 3 months, in combination with ephedra and willow bark, modestly increases weight loss (12811). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking an herbal treatment containing ephedra and cola nut for 6 months reduces body weight by 2.7 kg and body fat by 1.6 kg when compared with placebo in overweight and obese individuals (8647).

Caffeine is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine at the cellular level. However, caffeine does not seem to affect supplemental adenosine because high interstitial levels of adenosine overcome the antagonistic effects of caffeine (11771). It is recommended that methylxanthines and methylxanthine-containing products (including cola nut) be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770).

Also, caffeine may enhance the frequency and intensity of hypoglycemic warning symptoms in patients with type 1 diabetes. Theoretically, this may increase the ability of diabetics to detect and treat hypoglycemia early. However, it might also increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events (6024).

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with cola nut, specifically. However, cola nut contains caffeine. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram). Serious toxicity can occur at lower doses depending on variables in caffeine sensitivity such as smoking, age, or prior caffeine use (11832, 95700). Also, large doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, ketosis, and death (11838, 13734, 13735).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with cola nut. Survival from caffeine overdose may be possible if subjects receive prompt and proper treatment. Treatment of caffeine toxicity primarily involves supportive care and sometimes dialysis (91024, 95956).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of cola nut.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of cola nut is the nut and seed. Cola nut contains saponins, flavonoids, anthocyanins, glycosides, tannins, theobromine, kolatin, methylxanthines, theophylline phenolics, chlorogenic acid, d-catechin, epicatechin, glucose, starch, cellulose, protein, and stimulants, including caffeine (54369, 57711, 94049, 94050, 94051, 94052). Catechin is the predominant flavonoid, and caffeine is the major alkaloid found in cola nut (57705). Cola nut also contains high amounts of potassium (3,485 mg/kg) and phosphorus (411 mg/kg) (57694). Of the studied species, Cola nitida was found to be highest in flavonoid and caffeine content, while Cola anomala possesses high amounts of theobromine (57705). Glutamic acid was the most concentrated amino acid in a sample of Cola acuminate. Total amino acids were 356 mg/g of protein (57675).\n\nBoth free and associated caffeine were found in extracts of Cola nitida (57670). Associated caffeine concentrations varied from 0% in dried seeds to 91% in lyophilized fresh seeds and stabilized extract of cola. These differences may explain the variable pharmacological effects of fresh and dried seeds, as caffeine is responsible for most of the pharmacologic effects of cola nut (6372).\nAntimicrobial effects\nThere is conflicting evidence on the antimicrobial effects of cola nut. In vitro, cola nut did not exhibit antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteria, Shigella sonnei, or Candida albicans (57665).\n\nHowever, other in vitro evidence suggests that susceptibility of certain bacterial and fungal strains is affected by the solvent used in the extract. An ethyl acetate extract made from cola nut bark showed bactericidal activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermis, E. faecalis, and S. sciuri. An ethanol extract showed bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. epidermis. Only bacteriostatic effects were seen with the other strains tested, which included C. albicans, E. faecalis, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, M. luteus, S. oralis, and S. epidermis. No effect was seen on E. coli. Bacteriostatic effects were also seen on strains of P. citrinum, A. tamarii, and F. verticillioides. Overall, the ethyl acetate extract showed more activity than the ethanol extract. Compounds in the ethyl acetate solvent may be more soluble than in the ethanol extract. Tannins contribute to the antimicrobial effects, and flavonoids have antifungal effects (94052).\nAntioxidant effects\nCola species are a source of polyphenol antioxidants (54369, 57677, 57711, 57712). Tannins contribute to the antioxidant effects of cola nut. In vitro, cola nut has both DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity. An ethanol extract demonstrated nearly twice as much antioxidant capability as an ethyl acetate extract (94052).\nCardiovascular effects\nCola nut contains caffeine. Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), heart, muscles, and possibly the pressor centers that control blood pressure (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (6370). Caffeine can have positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart (11836). Caffeine can also acutely elevate both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, but might not have this effect in habitual users (2722). In rats, low concentrations of cola nut stimulated the heart by increasing the rate and force of contraction, as well as the metabolic rate. Higher concentrations reduced the rate and amplitude of the heartbeat, resulting in heart failure at still higher concentrations (57702). Arterial pressure has also been shown to be elevated in animals secondary to cola nut, similar to caffeine (57696). Overall, cola nut affects the cardiovascular system similarly to caffeine (57686).\n\nStudies have also suggested that caffeine influences cardiovascular stress reactivity, either by potentiating the stress response itself or adding to the level reached during stress (6372). Caffeine may cause a slight decrease in heart rate after consumption and appears to raise blood pressure during psychological stress (6372).\n\nCaffeine may be beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. There is evidence that caffeine inhibits platelet aggregation and suppresses thromboxane formation during blood clotting (8028, 8029).\nChemoprotective effects\nCaffeine, a constituent of cola nut, has antioxidant activity which may play a role in chemoprevention (57677). In vitro, cola nut has been shown to contain phytoestrogenic compounds that exert dose-dependent cytotoxic effects against breast cancer cells (57669).\nDermatologic effects\nIn an animal study, plant extracts of cola nut suppressed wrinkle formation, dermal connective alteration, and collagen accumulation (57673). It was suggested that the xanthine derivatives in cola nut may have prevented neutrophil infiltration caused by UV irradiation.\nDiuretic effects\nCaffeine, a constituent of cola nut, exerts a diuretic effect, with water losses estimated at 1.17 mL per mg of caffeine (2712). In rats, oral administration of a cola nut seed aqueous extract significantly increased 24-hour urine output. Compared to 20 mg/kg furosemide, doses of 400, 600, and 800 mg/kg had 39%, 58%, and 62% diuretic activity, respectively. Daily administration of the cola nut seed aqueous extract, over 4 weeks, significantly decreased urine pH compared to baseline values. Urine concentrations of sodium and chloride were significantly increased compared with control. Also, urine potassium levels were higher in the groups receiving 600 and 800 mg/kg compared to control. A significant decrease in plasma sodium and chloride was seen for the two higher dosage groups, with no differences in plasma potassium levels in any group. The diuretic actions of the extract are most similar to a loop diuretic. The extract likely inhibited the sodium/potassium/chloride cotransporter, causing more solute to be delivered to the distal nephron, leading to increased urine output secondary to changes in the osmotic pressure gradient. The increase in sodium to the distal tubule resulted in exchange of hydrogen and potassium, causing the urine pH to decrease (94050).\n\nHowever, tachyphylaxis to this diuretic effect can develop (10206). Caffeine does not substantially affect the fluid status of people who drink caffeinated beverages on a regular basis (10206). Also, caffeine-containing beverages consumed during moderate endurance exercise do not appear to compromise bodily hydration status (2713).\nExercise effects\nCola nut contains caffeine. Caffeine, alone or in combination with ephedrine, can improve anaerobic exercise performance. Caffeine seems to enhance muscle metabolism and increases time to exhaustion and oxygen deficit, which may lead to better performance (8646).\nGastrointestinal effects\nCola nut stimulates gastric acid secretion, possibly due to caffeine which stimulates gastric acid secretion (11837, 57683, 57701). In vitro, extracts of Cola nitida and Cola acuminata (P.Beauv.) inhibited amylase activity at varying magnitudes (57719). In human research, when cola nut was chewed, saliva production increased (57692).\nGlucose effects\nCaffeine, the main component of cola nut, has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose. In people with type 2 diabetes, acute administration of caffeine impairs postprandial glucose metabolism, while acute abstention from caffeine reduces postprandial glucose levels by 21% (12374). Other research in obese people suggests that caffeine ingestion may contribute to insulin resistance (12375, 13744). However, one study found that patients with type 1 diabetes taking 200 mg of caffeine twice daily had increased frequency and intensity of warning signs of hypoglycemia. This may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the brain and an increase in glucose utilization by the brain (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740).\nHormone effects\nAn animal study done on rat pituitary cells suggests that cola nut inhibited luteinizing hormone (LH) release and had no effect on follicle-stimulating hormone release; the inhibition in LH release in the culture medium occurred without changes to pituitary cell content (57666, 57682).Caffeine, a constituent of cola nut, might be associated with decreased levels of testosterone and increased levels of estrone and sex-hormone binding globulin. These findings might explain why some studies have reported associations between caffeine and hormone-dependent conditions such as fibrocystic disease, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and endometriosis (8043). Extracts from cola nut may also inhibit gonadotropin release in rats, which may affect estrous cycle regulation (57663).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nCaffeine, a constituent of cola nut, may increase plasma levels of cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), decrease levels of extracellular potassium, and increase levels of intracellular calcium in skeletal muscle. The mechanisms for this activity are poorly understood (6370).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using cola nut for Alzheimer's disease and other related disorders. In vitro, cola seed aqueous extract inhibited both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase in a dose-dependent manner. This cola nut extract also inhibited malondialdehyde production and exhibited DPPH free and OH radical scavenging activity as well as iron chelating activity. The extract may decrease the production of free radicals and prevent oxidative stress, which are thought to contribute to or cause neurodegeneration. The iron chelating activity may help to prevent the initiation of lipid peroxidation by forming a complex with iron. Caffeine is a noncompetitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Phenolic acids may be the components responsible for inhibition of both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (94051).\n\nCaffeine may protect dopaminergic neurons in the brain. This effect appears to be related to modulation of adenosine receptors (10201). This may result in a reduction in the clinical expression of Parkinsonism (6022).\n\nIt has been proposed that caffeine may decrease GABA and serotonin signaling (6370). The CNS stimulant effects of caffeine are thought to improve vigilance and psychomotor performance (2720, 10205). For improving athletic performance, caffeine has been shown to decrease perceived levels of exertion, which enables the athlete to feel less tired and increase their performance (6370).\n\nHowever, cola nut has been reported to prolong sleep latencies and to suppress REM sleep and stages 3 and 4 of sleep (57697). The mechanism of action is not clear.\nRespiratory effects\nCaffeine, the main component of cola nut, decreases airway resistance and stimulates respiration via adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (11836).\nWeight loss effects\nAnimal research shows that cola nut may suppress the appetite (57690, 94050). Caffeine, a constituent of cola nut, increases resting energy expenditure (REE) and cellular thermogenesis. It also causes an increase in nonoxidative fatty acid turnover and lipid oxidation; however, the net effect on lipid oxidation is small. The effects of caffeine on energy expenditure and lipid metabolism seem to be mediated by both sympathetic and non-sympathetic mechanisms (13733). Caffeine is often used in combination with ephedra and other stimulants for weight loss and seems to have additive pharmacodynamic effects (8647). Caffeine in combination with ephedra also increases oxygen consumption. Whether the increased oxygen consumption is an indication of a significant increase in metabolism which contributes to weight loss is unknown (8645)."

After topical application of forskolin in rabbits, the peak reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) was after 2-3 hours; IOP remained significantly reduced for 10 hours (44437). When the ocular penetration of forskolin in suspension was investigated, it was shown that only 0.03% of the instilled forskolin penetrated the ocular tissue (44419).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of coleus is the root. Coleus root and the stem base contain forskolin, a diterpene that is considered to be the major active constituent (7277, 44403, 44409, 44436). Other constituents isolated from coleus included diterpene glycosides, forskoditerpenosides A, B and an eudesmane sesquiterpene, 4beta, 7beta, 11-enantioeudesmantriol. Additionally, six compounds were isolated from the root of coleus: 14-deoxycoleon U, demethylcryptojaponol, alpha-amyrin, betulic acid, alpha-cedrol and beta-sitosterol (44404).\nAnti-obesity effects\nColeus has been studied for weight loss. Preliminary evidence in animals suggests that consuming coleus extract for 8 weeks decreases fat accumulation, body weight, food intake (44401, 44402).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThe coleus constituent forskolin stimulates insulin and glucagon release in vitro and in animals. Diabetic rats had a subsequent increase in blood glucose levels (44405).\nAntihistamine effects\nIn vitro forskolin appears to inhibit antigen-induced release of histamine and leukotrienes (44422, 44423).\nAntineoplastic effects\nSome coleus constituents appear to have antineoplastic effects. In vitro studies show that the coleus constituent forskolin may block tumor cell-induced human platelet aggregation, prevent tumor cell growth, cause cancer cell apoptosis, and prevent cancer metastasis (7412, 7413, 44410). Another coleus constituent 13-epi-sclereol prevented growth of breast and uterine cancers in vitro (44415).\nCardiovascular effects\nForskolin, a coleus constituent, stimulates and activates the enzyme adenylate cyclase in the heart and smooth muscle. This causes increased production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which causes calcium channels to open and intracellular calcium concentrations to increase, resulting in increased contractility of heart muscle and relaxation of smooth muscle (7277, 7406, 7407, 7408, 7409, 44393, 44396, 44433, 44443, 44444). This effect is seen as tachycardia, vasodilation and decreased blood pressure (44396, 44431).\n\nResearchers speculate that coleus might also activate adenylate cyclase in other cells of the body such as platelet cells (7277, 44427). There is preliminary evidence that the coleus constituent forskolin prevents platelet aggregation and adhesion (7410, 7411, 44417, 44421). Other preliminary research suggests that forskolin prevents platelet aggregation directly instead by activating adenylate cyclase (44434).\nEndocrine effects\nResearchers speculate that coleus might also activate adenylate cyclase in other cells of the body such as platelet cells and cells in the thyroid, pancreas, adrenal, or pituitary glands (7277, 44427).\nOcular effects\nSome evidence suggests that the coleus constituent forskolin reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with and without glaucoma. By stimulating adenylate cyclase activity topically applied coleus constituent forskolin reduces IOP in rabbits, monkeys and humans (7402, 7403, 44425, 44428).\nUrogenital effects\nThere is promising evidence suggesting that the coleus constituent forskolin can be used as an addition to a standard 3-agent pharmacotherapy for vasculogenic impotence (erectile dysfunction) (44441). Preliminary research suggests that forskolin increases cAMP accumulation and increases intracorporeal pressure by up to 90% (44435)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAging skin. Oral collagen peptides seem to improve skin hydration and elasticity in older adults. However, it is unclear if any improvements related to wrinkles are cosmetically important.\nMeta-analyses of the available research, as well as multiple individual clinical studies, show that collagen peptide products, taken in doses of 372 mg to 12 grams daily for 4-12 weeks, improve skin hydration and elasticity in older adults. Studied products include Peptan-F or Peptan-P (Rousselot), Wellnex (Nitta Gelatin), Gold Collagen Active (Minerva Research Labs), VERISOL (Gelita AG), and Nippi peptide FCP-EX (Nippi/Shizuoka) (97632, 100703, 101597, 104647, 107460, 112457, 115044). Pooled study results also suggest that hydrolyzed collagen sourced from fish improves skin hydration and elasticity, while collagen peptides originating from chickens seems to modestly improve skin elasticity but not hydration. Collagen peptides derived from bovine do not seem to improve skin hydration or elasticity (112457).\n\nDespite research showing improvement in skin hydration and elasticity, it is unclear if collagen peptides reduce skin wrinkles to a cosmetically significant degree, as most studies have not evaluated this outcome. In one clinical study, taking a freshwater fish-derived collagen peptide (Vinh Wellness Collagen, Vinh Hoan Corporation) 10 grams every morning reduced wrinkle count in the nasolabial region of the right side, but not the left side, of the face by 24% when compared with placebo. Collagen peptides did not improve participant-reported measures of wrinkles, elasticity, hydration, and others, when compared with placebo (104639). Another clinical study shows that taking a specific fish scale-derived collagen peptide (Wellnex, Nitta Gelatin) with either a high or low ratio of prolyl-hydroxyproline and hydroxylpropyl-glycine as 5 grams orally daily for 8 weeks modestly improves wrinkle depth and roughness, but not wrinkle volume, when compared with placebo. The product with a high ratio of dipeptides had a larger effect (97632). Also, one clinical study shows that taking a specific product containing porcine collagen type I peptides (VERISOL, Gelita AG) 2.5 grams daily for 8 weeks reduces eye wrinkle volume by 20% when compared with placebo (101648). Two similar moderate-size clinical studies in middle-aged adults with crow's feet wrinkles and dry skin show that taking specific low-molecular-weight fish-derived collagen peptide products (Geltech Co.; CPNS) at doses of 2000 mg or 1650 mg, respectively, daily for 12 weeks improves eye wrinkles, skin hydration, and elasticity when compared with placebo (110729, 110730). While investigator satisfaction scores regarding wrinkle reduction were modestly improved, participant satisfaction was not improved (110729). A moderate-sized clinical study in middle-aged adults shows that taking a specific collagen peptide supplement (Peptan-P®, Rousselot) 5 grams daily for 12 weeks does not decrease the visibility of crow's feet wrinkles when compared with placebo (115044).\n\nSmall clinical studies have shown contradictory findings when collagen peptides are taken in combination with other ingredients. In one clinical trial, a specific drink (Diva Luxe) providing fish collagen peptides 5.5 grams plus Chenopodium formosanum extract 1 gram daily for 8 weeks improved some measures of skin brightness and hydration, but not wrinkles and crow's feet, when compared with placebo (104646). Another small clinical study shows that taking collagen peptides 4 grams daily in combination with coenzyme Q10 50 mg, vitamin C, vitamin A, and biotin for 12 weeks reduces wrinkles and improves skin smoothness by a small amount when compared with placebo. However, there was no difference in skin elasticity or hydration (104638). A clinical study in older females shows that taking collagen peptides 9 grams in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C, and E daily for 90 days increases stratum corneum water content and skin viscoelasticity when compared with placebo. However, it is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups. Small improvements in dermal echogenicity, wrinkles, or skin pores were noted in some facial regions, but the lack of statistical comparison to placebo limits the validity of these findings (107464). Some small clinical studies have shown mixed effects with low doses of collagen peptides from preliminary clinical research using BioCell Collagen (BioCell Technology, LLC) or Celergen (Laboratories-Dom) (28681, 97930). It is unclear if any improvements from these studies are due to collagen peptides, other ingredients, or the combinations.\n\nTopical application of collagen peptides has been minimally evaluated. A very small observational study in older adults has found that application of a carbopol gel containing collagen peptides 1% to the periorbital area twice daily for 8 weeks is associated with increased skin hydration and elasticity and reduced transepidermal water loss, skin roughness, and wrinkles when compared with baseline (107459). The validity of these findings is limited by poor study methodology, lack of statistical comparison to baseline, and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDry skin. Oral collagen peptides seem to improve skin hydration and elasticity in adults with dry skin. However, their effect on other measures of dry skin is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 19 clinical studies, along with several small and moderate-sized individual studies, some of which are included in the meta-analysis, show that taking collagen peptides 372 mg to 12 grams daily for 4-12 weeks improves skin hydration and elasticity when compared with placebo in healthy adults (107461, 110729, 110730, 112457, 112458, 115044). Some studies show that collagen peptides improve skin roughness (107461), decrease peeling (110729, 110730), and increase stratum corneum and epidermis water content (107462) but not skin gloss (107461) or elasticity (107462). Some research shows that collagen peptides reduce transepidermal water loss (107462), while another study shows no change (107461). Subgroup analysis of the meta-analysis suggests that hydrolyzed collagen sourced from fish improves skin hydration and elasticity the most, while collagen peptides originating from chicken seem to modestly improve skin elasticity but not hydration. Collagen peptides from bovine do not seem to improve skin hydration or elasticity (112457). Studied products include FCP-Z (Nippi Co., Ltd), Geltech Co., CPNS, and GPVGPS Collagen (Daehan Chemtech) (107462, 110729, 110730, 112458).\n\nCollagen peptides have also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in healthy adults with low skin moisture shows that drinking 30 mL of a beverage containing fish scale-derived collagen peptides 10 grams and ornithine 400 mg (FUJIFILM) daily for 8 weeks does not improve skin moisture but seems to improve skin elasticity and reduce water loss when compared with placebo (101607). Another very small clinical study in a mixed population of patients with dry skin and mild atopic dermatitis shows that twice daily application of an emollient containing collagen peptides, soluble proteoglycan, and hyaluronic acid for 4 weeks reduces itching severity from moderate at baseline to mild or almost none. Transepidermal water loss and skin hydration also improved when compared to baseline (107465). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Both of these studies are limited by their small size, and it is unclear if any improvements are due to collagen peptides, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nMuscle strength. Most research suggests that oral collagen peptides do not improve leg strength. However, they may improve hand-grip strength and fat-free mass.\nSmall clinical studies in healthy male and female athletes or non-athletes undergoing resistance or other training show that taking collagen peptides 15-30 grams daily or after training sessions for up to 15 weeks, with or without vitamin C, does not improve leg strength (i.e. squat strength, knee extension, or flexor strength) when compared with placebo (101608, 104641, 107457, 110668, 110669). Similarly, 2 very small clinical studies in healthy adults show that taking a specific oral collagen peptide product (Bodybalance, Gelita AG) 5-15 grams daily while completing a resistance training program for 14-15 weeks increases patellar tendon cross-sectional area but does not improve most measures of tendinous tissue remodeling including patellar tendon size, vastus lateralis aponeurosis size, patellar tendon mechanical properties, tendon stiffness, maximal knee extension strength, or rectus femoris muscle cross-sectional area when compared with placebo (112452, 112454). However, a small clinical study with the same product in untrained females aged 18-50 years shows that taking 15 grams daily in addition to resistance training three times weekly for 12 weeks improves hand-grip strength when compared with resistance training and placebo (101608). In untrained males aged 30-60 years, taking the same dose of this collagen peptide product along with resistance training for 12 weeks improves fat-free mass by 3 kg, compared with 2 kg with resistance training and placebo. A post-hoc exploratory analysis suggests that the effects seen in males are similar to those seen with whey protein (107457).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Although there has been interest in using oral collagen peptides for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of collagen peptides for this condition.\nAndrogenic alopecia. Oral collagen peptides have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients, their effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with androgenic alopecia or telogen effluvium shows that taking a combination product containing hydrolyzed collagen 300 mg, taurine, cysteine, methionine, iron, and selenium (GFM Oral, Cantabria Labs) daily along with conventional therapy, consisting primarily of finasteride or minoxidil, for 12 weeks improves hair loss when compared with conventional therapy alone (111636). It is unclear if this effect is due to collagen peptides, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides improve performance in most athletes.\nIn recreationally active female runners undergoing resistance and endurance training 3 times weekly, clinical research shows that taking collagen peptides 7.5 grams twice daily for 12 weeks increases running distance by approximately 1,034 meters, compared with an increase of 703 meters in those taking placebo, although there was no effect on speed (104641). A clinical study in healthy young male athletes undergoing heavy strength and power training shows that taking collagen peptides 20 grams and vitamin C 50 mg daily for 3 weeks improves squat performance and countermovement jump performance when compared with placebo. However, removal of a single outlier negated the statistical significance of most of these findings (107456). Also, it is unclear if any improvements from this study are due to collagen peptides, vitamin C, or the combination.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral or topical collagen peptides are beneficial for improving the severity of eczema.\nA small clinical study in patients with atopic dermatitis shows that taking a porcine skin-derived collagen peptide with a high ratio of tripeptides with glycine-X-Y sequences, 3.9 grams daily for 12 weeks, improves symptoms and severity of eczema when compared to baseline. There was no improvement in the group taking the same dose of porcine skin-derived collagen peptide without the high ratio of tripeptides (101605). Another very small clinical study in a mixed population of patients with atopic dermatitis and dry skin shows that twice daily application of an emollient containing collagen peptides, soluble proteoglycan, and hyaluronic acid for 4 weeks reduces itching severity from moderate at baseline to mild or almost none. Transepidermal water loss and skin hydration also improved when compared to baseline (107465). It is unclear if any improvements are due to collagen peptides, the other ingredients, or the combination. Both of these studies are limited by their small size and lack of comparator groups.\nless\nBrittle nails. One small clinical study suggests that oral collagen peptides may improve nail health in people with brittle nails.\nA small clinical study shows that taking a specific porcine type I collagen peptide product (VERISOL, Gelita AG) 2.5 grams daily for 6 months improves overall symptoms of brittle nail syndrome, increases nail growth rate by 12%, and reduces broken nail frequency by 42% when compared with baseline (101606). This study was limited by its small size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBurns. Some preliminary clinical research suggests that oral collagen peptides might reduce the time needed for burn healing.\nIn male patients with 20% to 30% body surface area burns, a small clinical trial shows that taking a collagen-based supplement providing collagen peptides (Amutiya, Qom) 36 grams daily for 4 weeks improves wound healing when compared with taking an isocaloric supplement containing the same amount of soy protein. Complete wound healing occurred in 50% and 100% of patients taking collagen for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, compared with 7% and 40% of those taking the isocaloric product. The duration of hospital stay was not significantly different between the two groups (104642). A small clinical study in hospitalized adults with 20-45% body surface area 2nd or 3rd degree burns shows that consuming a beverage containing collagen peptides 40 grams daily for 4 weeks shortens the time to wound healing, improves scar scores, and reduces the duration of hospital stays but does not limit wound infections when compared with placebo. Adding fish oil 3 grams daily did not further improve outcomes (110667).\nless\nCellulite. One small clinical study suggests that oral collagen peptides may reduce cellulite.\nIn people with cellulite, a small clinical study shows that taking specific collagen peptides (VERISOL by Gelita AG) 2.5 grams daily for 6 months seems to reduce cellulite, skin waviness, and dermal density by a small amount when compared with placebo (101619).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides are beneficial for improving memory.\nIn healthy adults, preliminary clinical research shows that taking collagen peptides 5 grams daily for 4 weeks improves some measures of memory and verbal learning when compared to baseline (104643). This study was limited by its small size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDermatoporosis. One small clinical study suggests that using oral or topical collagen peptides does not improve this condition.\nA small clinical study in post-menopausal patients aged 70 years on average with mild dermatoporosis shows that taking collagen peptides 5 grams daily, applying a collagen peptides 2.5% serum 3 pumps nightly to each forearm, or using these in combination for 6 months does not improve skin lesions, epidermal thickness, collagen or elastin density, or patient perception of skin improvement when compared with placebo (110731). However, it is unclear if these results apply to patients with more severe dermatoporosis.\nless\nDiabetes. Some preliminary clinical research suggests that oral collagen peptides might have a small effect on glycemic indices.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking fish-derived collagen peptides 6.5 grams orally twice daily for 3 months, in addition to treatment with antidiabetes drugs, may modestly reduce levels of fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and fasting blood insulin and may increase levels of insulin sensitivity when compared with antidiabetes drugs and placebo (101626, 101627).\nless\nErythema. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides are beneficial for erythema.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with dry and wrinkled eye skin shows that taking low-molecular weight collagen peptides (GPVGPS Collagen, Daehan Chemtech) 2000 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces erythema index when compared with placebo (112458).\nless\nExercise-induced gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides prevent GI symptoms due to exercise.\nA small crossover study in moderately well-trained young adults shows that taking collagen peptides 10 grams daily for 7 days prior to rigorous treadmill exercise does not limit GI symptoms but may attenuate some markers of GI distress when compared with placebo (110665).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides improve recovery from muscle damage after exercise.\nA small clinical study in active adults shows that taking oral collagen peptides 25 grams immediately post-exercise and once daily for 3 days does not improve indices of muscle recovery including muscle soreness, muscle function, or running economy, when compared with placebo (116133).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides prevent muscle soreness after exercise.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small number of healthy, recreationally active adults shows that taking collagen peptides (Peptan, Rousselot BVBA, Collagen Peptides, Vital Proteins) 10-15 grams twice daily, starting 7 days prior to strenuous exercise and continuing for 2-5 days after, does not reduce muscle soreness when compared with placebo (100700, 104648). However, there was a small benefit on the recovery of countermovement jump ability within 24 hours (104648). Furthermore, another small clinical study in adults unaccustomed to exercise shows that taking collagen peptides 10 grams daily for 33 days modestly reduces muscle soreness and fatigue immediately after the exercise load, but not 2 hours after exercise or the next morning, when compared with placebo (111639). Also, a small clinical study in active middle-aged adults shows that taking specific collagen peptides (SOLUGEL Collagen Peptides, PB Leiner) 10 grams daily for 6 months improves pain in those who exercise frequently (>188 minutes weekly) when compared with placebo. However, collagen peptides do not seem to improve pain in low frequency exercisers (<188 minutes weekly) (112455).\n\nCollagen peptides have also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One preliminary clinical study in healthy, recreationally active adults shows that taking a specific product (BioCell Collagen, BioCell Technology, LLC) containing collagen peptides from chicken collagen type II, hyaluronic acid, and chondroitin sulfate 1.5 grams twice daily for 6 weeks prior to two bouts of intense resistance exercise attenuates increases in biomarkers of muscle damage and decreases delayed onset muscle soreness when compared with placebo (96301). It is unclear if these benefits are due to collagen peptides, other ingredients or the combination.\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides are beneficial for patients with gingivitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate chronic gingivitis shows that taking a specific collagen peptide product (Verisol B, Gelita AG) 5 grams daily for 90 days following mechanical plaque removal reduces bleeding and inflammation but does not improve plaque scores when compared with placebo (110666).\nless\nHypertension. Limited research suggests that oral collagen peptides may lower systolic or diastolic blood pressure. However, results are inconsistent.\nOne preliminary clinical study in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes shows that taking fish-derived collagen peptides 6.5 grams twice daily for 3 months modestly reduces diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure when compared with placebo (101626). Another small clinical study in patients with mildly elevated blood pressure shows that taking a test food containing chicken leg-derived collagen peptides 2.9 grams daily for 12 weeks lowers systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure when compared with placebo (101610). An additional small clinical study in patients with mild hypertension shows that taking chicken leg-derived collagen peptides 5.2 grams daily 4 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by 12 mmHg when compared with baseline (101618). This study was limited by its small size and lack of a comparator group. The reasons for conflicting data are unclear.\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides are beneficial for insomnia.\nA very small clinical study in physically active males with difficulty sleeping shows that taking collagen peptides 15 grams before bedtime for 7 nights reduces the frequency of nocturnal awakenings and improves cognitive accuracy but does not improve objective measures of total sleep time, latency, efficiency, stage changes, waking after sleep onset, other cognitive function measures, or subjective measures of sleepiness, fatigue, and sleep quality when compared with placebo (112459).\nless\nJoint pain. Most research shows that oral collagen peptides might moderately reduce joint pain in young athletes. However, evidence in other adults is conflicting.\nPreliminary clinical research in student athletes with joint pain shows that taking a specific collagen peptide product (FORTIGEL, Gelita AG) 10 grams in 25 mL of liquid daily for 24 weeks modestly improves pain during movement and at rest when compared with placebo (101601). Other clinical research in young adults exercising or participating in sports at least 3 hours weekly with activity-related knee pain shows that taking this same product 5 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces pain intensity during activity by 38% to 41%, compared with a 26% to 28% reduction in those taking placebo. However, there was no improvement in pain at rest or after the activity when compared with placebo (97623, 107454). Furthermore, it is not clear if these effects are clinically significant.\n\nResearch on the use of collagen peptides in older patients is conflicting. A large clinical study in generally healthy adults with functional knee and hip pain during daily activities shows that taking a specific collagen peptide product (FORTIGEL, Gelita AG) 5 grams daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces pain at rest and during walking, per a physician assessment, when compared with placebo (114907). The validity of this finding is limited by the use of per-protocol analysis. A small clinical study in otherwise healthy patients aged 40-65 years with joint discomfort shows that taking a specific collagen peptides product (AVC-H2, Avicenna) 1.25 grams twice daily for 8 weeks improves overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) scores by 37% at 4 weeks, compared with 14% in those receiving placebo. However, this difference in improvement was no longer significant at 8 weeks. Collagen peptides also improved the physical activity and stiffness subdomains, but not the pain subdomain, at 4 and 8 weeks when compared with placebo (107455). A larger clinical study in patients 50 years or older with general joint pain shows that taking a specific collagen peptides product (Genacol) 1200 mg daily for 6 months does not reduce pain or improve function when compared with placebo (97657).\n\nHowever, collagen peptides used in combination with other ingredients have shown benefit. Preliminary clinical research in patients 51-70 years of age shows that taking a specific combination product (Gold Collagen Active, Minerva Research Labs) containing fish collagen peptides 4 grams, glucosamine hydrochloride 1000 mg, chondroitin sulfate 500 mg, L-carnitine 200 mg, and other ingredients daily for 90 days reduces joint pain by 43% when compared with baseline, while patients taking placebo saw negligible improvement in pain. A greater percentage of patients taking this product also perceived improvements in joint discomfort, flexibility, mobility, and rigidity when compared with placebo (100703). It is unclear if these effects are due to collagen peptides, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nKnee pain. Collagen peptides have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate meniscal tears shows that taking a combination product containing collagen peptides 2000 mg, hydrolyzed collagen type II, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine sulfate, hyaluronic acid, methylsulfonylmethane, and other ingredients (Naturagen 4 Joint, Naturagen) daily for 8 weeks improves some assessments of pain and function but does not improve objective measures, including leg strength, balance, or stair climbing time, when compared with placebo (116134). It is unclear if these effects are due to collagen peptides, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides are beneficial for weight loss.\nA preliminary clinical study in adults with overweight shows that taking skate skin-derived collagen peptides 2 grams daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces body fat mass by 1.2 kg, compared with an increase of 0.3 kg in the placebo group (101621). It is unclear if collagen peptides improve weight loss or reduce body fat mass in the long-term.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Most research suggests that oral collagen peptides improve pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis; however, any improvement is modest and may not be considered clinically significant.\nA meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies, all of which are included below, in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking collagen peptides or hydrolyzed collagen reduces pain when compared with placebo (112456). Clinical research shows that taking specific collagen peptides (Colnatur, Protein SA) 10 grams daily for 5 months increases the number of patients who experience at least a 30% improvement in pain by approximately 42% when compared with placebo. However, there is no difference between groups when the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) scale is used. Patients with the greatest joint deterioration at baseline, as well as those with the lowest dietary meat intake, seemed most likely to experience benefit from collagen peptides (97635). Another small clinical study shows that taking collagen peptides isolated from pork skin and bovine bone (Nitta Gelatin Inc.) 5 grams dissolved in 250 mL water or milk twice daily after food for 13 weeks modestly improves pain when compared with placebo (101611). Another small clinical study in patients over 40 years old shows that taking collagen peptides (Colatech) 10 grams daily for 90 days reduces pain by about 2 points on a 100-point scale, compared with a 0.9-point reduction with glucosamine sulfate 1.5 grams. Ibuprofen use was not affected (101622). One multicenter clinical study shows that taking collagen peptides 10 grams daily for 6 months does not relieve pain or improve joint function when compared with placebo, although a trend towards reduced pain and improved joint function was observed in patients with severe symptoms at baseline (7704).\n\nCollagen peptides have also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, or hand shows that taking a specific product (BioCell Collagen, BioCell Technology, LLC) containing collagen peptides from chicken collagen type II, hyaluronic acid, and chondroitin sulfate 1 gram twice daily for up to 10 weeks reduces pain and the need for rescue analgesics and increases physical activity when compared with placebo (28678, 28680). Similarly, a moderate-size clinical study in patients aged 45-75 years with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis undergoing resistance exercise twice weekly shows that taking a specific product (Suntory Beverage and Food Asia) containing collagen peptides from chicken collagen type II, hyaluronic acid, and chondroitin sulfate 2 grams daily for 24 weeks does not improve WOMAC scores when compared with glucosamine 1.5 grams daily or placebo, but may modestly improve pain scores when compared with placebo. However, the use of rescue analgesics was not assessed. Adding essence of chicken 5.81 grams daily to collagen peptides did not improve WOMAC or pain scores (110670). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with knee osteoarthrosis shows that taking a specific product (Ialoral 1500, PharmaSuisse Laboratories Srl) containing collagen peptides, chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and keratin peptides for 4 weeks improves pain and function by a moderate amount when compared with baseline (104645). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the control group. It is unclear if these effects are due to collagen peptides, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOsteopenia. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides prevent loss of bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal adults.\nA large clinical study in patients with reduced BMD after menopause shows that taking specific collagen peptides (Fortibone, Gelita AG) 5 grams daily for 12 months increases BMD of the spine and the femoral neck by 3% and 7%, respectively, compared with losses of 1% with placebo (101609). In a very small observational extension of this study, BMD continued to increase over an additional 4 years when compared with baseline. However, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group (107340).\n\nCollagen peptides have also been evaluated in combination with calcium and vitamin D. In patients with osteopenia after menopause, a small clinical study shows that taking collagen peptides calcium chelate 5 grams, containing elemental calcium 500 mg and vitamin D3 200 IU, daily for 12 months does not affect total hip, total body, or vertebral BMD when compared with calcium 500 mg and vitamin D 200 IU (101604). The validity of these results is limited by a high dropout rate and insufficient power to detect smaller effects. Conversely, another small study in this population shows that taking specific collagen peptides (Fortibone, Gelita AG) in combination with elemental calcium (as calcium lactate) 500 mg and vitamin D3 400 IU daily for 12 months improves trabecular bone mineral content, trabecular volumetric BMD, and cortical volumetric BMD, but not cortical bone mineral content, when compared with a combination tablet containing equivalent doses of elemental calcium (as calcium carbonate) and vitamin D (107453). It is unclear if these effects are due to collagen peptides, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides improve bone mineral density (BMD) in adults with osteoporosis after menopause.\nIn patients with osteoporosis after menopause, clinical research shows that taking collagen peptides 10 grams daily in addition to twice weekly intramuscular calcitonin for 6 months does not improve BMD in the forearm when compared with calcitonin alone (104649). It is unclear if supplementation with collagen peptides improves BMD in the femoral neck or lumbar spine.\nless\nPressure ulcers. Oral collagen peptides might help to improve ulcer size and healing.\nA small clinical study in patients with Stage II, III, or IV pressure ulcers shows that taking collagen peptides 5 grams orally three times daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard care improves ulcer size and exudate when compared with placebo and standard care (101612). This study was limited because it only used one scale to assess healing of the pressure ulcer. Another small clinical study in patients with stage II or III pressure ulcers shows that receiving standard care and collagen peptides with high levels of prolyl-hydroxyproline 5 grams twice daily for 16 weeks improves ulcer exudate, healing, and wound size when compared with standard care plus placebo (101620).\nless\nSarcopenia. Oral collagen peptides might help to increase fat-free mass. However, it is unclear if collagen peptides are more beneficial than other types of protein.\nA small clinical study in elderly males with sarcopenia shows that taking collagen peptides from type I collagen 15 grams daily for 12 weeks along with three resistance training sessions weekly modestly increases fat-free mass and power when compared with resistance training and placebo (101624). It is unclear if supplementation with collagen peptides is more beneficial than supplementation with protein.\nless\nSprains. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides improve ankle instability after a previous sprain.\nA small clinical study in athletes with chronic ankle instability from an ankle sprain shows that taking collagen peptides 5 grams daily for 6 months improves subjective ankle instability when compared with placebo. However, ankle stiffness, which is a more objective measure of ankle instability, is not improved when compared with placebo (101603).\nless\nTendinopathy. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides improve tendon pain.\nA small clinical study in patients with Achilles tendinopathy shows that taking a specific collagen peptides supplement (TENDOFORTE, Gelita AG) 2.5 grams daily for 3 months in addition to a calf-strengthening program improves pain when compared with baseline (101615). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if oral collagen peptides improve wound healing.\nA small clinical study in healthy volunteers with wounds after photothermolysis shows that taking collagen peptides 3 grams daily for 4 weeks improves erythema, skin hydration, and skin elasticity when compared with placebo (101599). This study was limited by small size, short duration, and no direct measurement of wound healing or scar formation.\nless\nWrinkled skin. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral collagen peptides might help to reduce lines and wrinkles from sun damage.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with photodamaged skin shows that taking a specific low molecular weight collagen peptide product (Evercollagen, Newtree Co.) 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly improves most measures of skin wrinkling, hydration, and elasticity when compared with placebo. This specific collagen peptide product is standardized to contain more than 15% glycine-containing tripeptides, including 3% glycyl-prolyl-hydroxyproline (100702). Another moderate-sized clinical study in adults with dry and wrinkled eye skin shows that taking low-molecular weight collagen peptides (GPVGPS Collagen, Daehan Chemtech) 2000 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces skin wrinkling parameters including facial skin roughness, peak-to-valley values, maximum wrinkle height, and eye wrinkle volume and improves skin hydration and skin elasticity when compared with placebo. However, there was no improvement in maximum wrinkle depth (112458).\n\nAnother preliminary clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product (BioCell Collagen, BioCell Technology, LLC) containing collagen peptides from chicken collagen type II 600 mg, low molecular weight hyaluronic acid 100 mg, and chondroitin sulfate 200 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces lines and wrinkles associated with both natural aging and photoaging by about 13% when compared to baseline (28681). This study was limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to collagen peptides, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate collagen peptides for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nCollagen peptides are typically used in doses of 2.5-10 grams daily for up to 6 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nCollagen peptides are sometimes standardized to specific dipeptides or tripeptides (97632, 101605, 101620, 101702).\nStandardization & Formulation\nCollagen peptides in clinical trials are derived from various sources such as fish (97632, 110729, 110730, 110731) and chicken (101626). Collagen peptides can be derived from gelatin, isolated collagen type I, or isolated collagen type II. Collagen peptides can contain different concentrations of specific peptides. For example, it can be standardized to contain high or low levels of dipeptides such as prolyl-hydroxyproline or of hydroxylpropyl-glycine (97632, 101620). Some collagen peptides are standardized to contain higher amounts of tripeptides with the sequence glycine-X-Y; the \"X\" and \"Y\" are usually the amino acids proline, hydroxyproline, and alanine (101605). One product was standardized to contain more than 15% glycine-containing tripeptides, including 3% glycyl-prolyl-hydroxyproline (100702).\n\nA specific collagen peptide product called BioCell Collagen contains collagen peptides sourced from chicken sternum collagen. Each 500 mg of this product includes hydrolyzed collagen type II 300 mg, hyaluronic acid 50 mg, and chondroitin sulfate 100 mg (28680, 28681, 28682, 96301). The remaining 50 mg is uncharacterized sternal cartilage components (28680, 28681, 96301).",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with collagen peptides.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nDue to their small size, collagen peptides are up to 90% absorbed within 12 hours of oral intake (97623, 101510, 101623). Some collagen peptides are hydrolyzed into dipeptides, tripeptides, or amino acids by enzymes such as peptidases, pancreatic proteases, and small intestinal brush-border proteases (101510, 111638). Maximum serum concentrations of dipeptides, tripeptides, and amino acids are observed about 0.5-2 hours after ingestion (100701, 100702, 101510, 111638, 114879), and maximum serum concentrations of amino acids are observed 1-2 hours after ingestion(114879). Taking collagen peptides with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increases the maximum serum concentration and area under the curve (AUC) of collagen-derived tripeptides, suggesting enhanced absorption when taken together (111638). Some clinical research in healthy male volunteers shows that fish scale collagen peptides are better absorbed than porcine skin collagen peptides (101510).\nDistribution\nCollagen peptides are absorbed into the blood from the intestine and then distributed into other organs including the dermis, muscle, bones, liver, kidney, and brain. Collagen peptides can remain in the dermis for up to 2 weeks (101510).\nExcretion\nUrinary hydroxyl-proline is an accurate biomarker of acute collagen intake for up to 6 hours after its consumption, but it is not sensitive to habitual intake of dietary collagen (101596).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCollagen peptides are small peptides derived from collagen. The most common method used to produce collagen peptides involves partially hydrolyzing isolated collagen to form gelatin, and then treating gelatin with specific proteinases to form the shorter collagen peptides (101510, 101613). Collagen peptides can be produced from collagen isolated from cattle, fish, pigs, or chicken (101613, 104639). The makeup of collagen peptides varies due to the source and age of the animal and the extraction process used. Collagen peptides can contain glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, and arginine. Unlike gelatin, collagen peptides are soluble in water and cannot form a gel (101613). Collagen peptides consists of proteins with an average size of 3.3 kilodaltons (kDa) ranging from 0.5 to 13.5 kDa (101601).\nBone effects\nThere is interest in using collagen peptides for strengthening bones or to prevent bone loss. In males, collagen peptides have been shown to improve collagen synthesis (101613). When taken after menopause, collagen peptides in combination with calcium and vitamin D seem to reduce bone turnover more than calcium and vitamin D alone, as determined by some biochemical indices. However, taking collagen peptides alone does not seem to affect bone remodeling (101602, 101609, 104644).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using collagen peptides for reducing skin aging and dry skin. The effects of collagen peptides on skin wrinkles, elasticity, and hydration are thought to be related to down-regulation of the expression and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This has been demonstrated in a study of mice exposed to UVB irradiation. MMPs degrade insoluble elastin and catabolize fibrillin microfibrils, leading to lower levels of elastic fibers in the skin (100702). In vitro evidence also shows that collagen peptides can stimulate the production of type II collagen and proteoglycans in chondrocytes (28681). Also, collagen peptides can be metabolized to various dipeptides. In vitro evidence shows that dipeptides can stimulate fibroblasts and chondrocytes to synthesize hyaluronic acid, which helps retain water in both the skin and synovial fluid (28681). Furthermore, animal research suggests that collagen peptides can prevent ultraviolet-induced skin damage by increasing the number of fibroblasts and the density and thickness of collagen fibrils in the skin (28681). A small clinical study in patients with dry skin has shown that oral administration of AP collagen peptides increases natural moisturizing factor and ceramides, the major components of the stratum corneum that maintain skin moisture, when compared with placebo (107461).\nGlycemic effects\nThere is interest in using collagen peptides to improve insulin resistance. Clinical research in adults shows that taking 5 grams of collagen peptides standardized to contain high levels of 2 bioactive peptides (propyl-hydroxyproline and hydroxyprolyl-glycine) daily for 12 weeks suppresses the production of toxic advanced glycated end products (AGEs) when compared with placebo. The reduction in AGEs is correlated with improvements in insulin resistance. Researchers theorize that collagen peptides lower AGE levels and subsequently reduce insulin resistance, leading to potential protection from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other disease states associated with aging (111637).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nOrally, collagen peptides have been shown to increase concentrations of certain collagen-derived dipeptides in the blood. In vitro and animal research shows that these collagen-derived dipeptides may stimulate and/or protect cells in various connective tissues. It is speculated that this might improve the metabolism of musculoskeletal connective tissue in response to strength training, and may improve resilience against intense exercise (96301). However, in humans the evidence is mixed. In resistance-trained, middle-aged males, taking collagen peptides enriched with vitamin C before high-intensity, resistance exercise increases collagen synthesis. Additionally, in young, recreationally active females, collagen peptides can increase levels of fat-free mass (104641). However, after menopause, taking collagen peptides does not seem to improve skeletal muscle protein synthesis (104640).\nNeurological effects\nIn middle aged adults, collagen peptides seem to have a small effect on cognitive skills. This may be due to changes in brain structure (104643).\nWound healing effects\nThere is interest in using collagen peptides for wound and burn healing. Collagen peptides have been shown to enhance the growth of skin fibroblasts in mice (100701). In human research, collagen peptides increase serum levels of pre-albumin, a marker of improved nutritional status in patients with burns (104642). The effects of collagen on predictors of survival in burn patients have also been studied. A small clinical study in patients with deep partial thickness or full thickness burns covering 20% to 45% of the total body surface area shows that taking collagen peptides in combination with fish oil for 3 weeks improves high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), but not glucose homeostasis, when compared with placebo (107458)."

In vitro research shows that collagen type I induces the activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and T cells of patients with scleroderma (101746). The collagen type I-induced activation of T cells and PBMCs isolated from patients with diffuse scleroderma seems to by reduced by a small amount following oral intake of collagen type I by these patients.

Oral collagen type II seems to improve stiffness, pain, and function by a small amount in patients with knee osteoarthritis, but any benefit on joint space narrowing is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking a specific collagen type II (UC-II, InterHealth Nutraceuticals, Inc.) 40 mg daily for up to 6 months reduces symptoms, such as stiffness, pain, and physical functioning, by about 20% when compared with baseline (97238, 97239). Taking this product might also improve some symptoms, such as pain and stiffness, when compared with glucosamine 1500 mg plus chondroitin 1200 mg (97239). A small clinical study in patients with knee osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes shows that taking a specific collagen type II (UC II, SEMNL Biotechnology) 40 mg daily for 3 months improves pain by 36%, compared with 5% in those receiving placebo (107466).\n\nIt is unclear if taking collagen type II is more beneficial than exercise.

Despite some conflicting results, oral collagen type II does not seem to improve symptoms of RA when compared with standard treatments.\nThree moderately large clinical studies in patients with RA, some of whom were using disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), show that taking chicken collagen type II 100-2500 mcg daily or bovine collagen type II 100-500 mcg daily for 6 months does not improve clinical response rates based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria when compared with placebo (3111, 44446, 101718). Other clinical research in patients stabilized on oral methotrexate shows that switching to chicken collagen type II 500 mcg orally daily actually increases disease activity when compared with continued treatment with methotrexate (44456). While some clinical research in patients not taking DMARDs shows that taking chicken collagen type II 100 mcg daily may reduce symptoms, the response rates based on ACR20 and ACR50 criteria are greater for patients treated with methotrexate 10 mg weekly when compared with chicken collagen type II (44451, 101717). One clinical study shows that taking low dose chicken collagen type II 20 mcg daily for 24 weeks improves clinical response according to the Paulus criteria, but not according to the ACR criteria, when compared with placebo.

Although evidence suggests this theory might be true in animals, it is unproven in humans (3126). Based on the theory of oral tolerance, when individuals with rheumatoid arthritis take oral collagen, the collagen should cause certain areas of the gut to generate T-cells that are absorbed by the body. Then, in the body, these T-cells are activated by joint collagen and they secrete cytokines that suppress inflammation. Cytokines thought to be involved include interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor beta (3111, 3112, 3125). Oral administration of collagen is also believed to decrease the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8; tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha; and interferon gamma (3111). So far, the studies determining the efficacy of chicken collagen type II demonstrate conflicting results (3125, 3112), but these studies have used microgram doses.\n\nIn rodent models of osteoarthritis and aging, administration of collagen type II attenuates inflammatory response and oxidative stress and improves motor function and symptoms (107466, 107467, 107469).\nBone effects\nIn a mouse model of aging, administration of collagen type II increases bone mineralization and formation and decreases bone resorption (107467)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of collard are the above ground parts. Cruciferous vegetables, including collard, contain carotenoids, glucosinolates, S-methylcystine sulfoxide, vitamin K (phylloquinone), ascorbic acid, and tocopherols (90480, 90481). Collard also contains flavonoids, tannins, saponins, sterols, terpenoids, anthocyanins, and carbohydrates (105712).\nAnticancer effects\nEvidence from epidemiological research suggests that vegetables of the Brassica oleracea species have protective effects against some types of cancer (14145). These vegetables contain about 10 different kinds of glucosinolates (6790). These glucosinolates are usually accompanied by myrosinase, a thioglucosidase enzyme found in plant cells in separate compartments (6792). When the plant cells are damaged by cutting or chewing, the myrosinase is exposed to glucosinolates, catalyzing its hydrolysis to a range of breakdown products, such as indoles, nitriles, and isothiocyanates (ITCs).\n\nITCs are sulfur-containing phytochemicals present in the form of sulforaphane (SFN), phenylethylisothiocyanate, benzylisothiocyanate, and 3-phenylpropylisothiocyanate. These chemicals are thought to be anticarcinogenic due to their effects on phase I and phase II enzymes (10264, 26449, 26483, 47627, 55547). Phase I and phase II enzymes act as the body's first line of defense against cancer by protecting the body from carcinogens that routinely enter the body through the diet and the environment. ITCs generally enhance the activity of phase II enzymes and inhibit phase I enzymes, thus reducing the production of electrophilic intermediates with carcinogenic activity and enhancing the detoxification and clearance of carcinogens. ITCs also act as suppressing agents during the promotion phase of the neoplastic process and induce apoptosis, thereby inhibiting cell growth (26449, 26485).\n\nIndoles include indole-3-acetonitrile, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) (47627). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that I3C inhibits carcinogenesis by inducing enzymes such as cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases (GST), or epoxide hydrolases (EH). These enzymes metabolize carcinogens to more polar and excretable forms (26489, 26491, 47596). Evidence from animal research has shown that indoles and isothiocyanates attenuate the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrosamines and are protective towards heterocyclic amines (51183). The effects on PAH and nitrosamines appear to be via induction of GST and inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, respectively.\n\nIndoles and phytoestrogens found in Brassica species may also contribute to the protection of hormone-dependent breast and cervical cancers. Evidence from animal research suggests that I3C inhibits mammary cancers (26469) and that its use may inhibit breast and cervical cancers in women (47627). In women, I3C increases the 2-hydroxylation of estrogen urinary metabolites (47615). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that I3C suppresses the proliferation of various tumor cells, including breast, prostate, endometrial, colon, and leukemic cells (47627).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research suggests that an aqueous extract of collard leaves and stems lowers blood glucose levels in a rat model of diabetes after both single- and multi-dose oral administration. Conversely, non-diabetic rats did not experience a reduction in blood glucose levels. The mechanism of this effect is unclear; it has been hypothesized that it may be attributable to the antioxidant activity of various phytochemical constituents of collard (105712).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that ascorbigen, a constituent of Brassica vegetables formed by indole-3-carbinole and ascorbic acid, is a less potent antioxidant than ascorbic acid. However, ascorbigen appears to prevent tert-butyl hydroperoxide cytotoxicity in vitro (26497). In vitro research also shows that an aqueous extract of collard leaves and stems demonstrates antioxidant activity (105712)."

Clay minerals are layer type aluminosilicates that figure in terrestrial biogeochemical cycles, in the buffering capacity of the oceans, and in the containment of toxic waste materials (1160). Humic shale is a common source of plant-derived colloidal minerals (1157). When mixed with water, the surfaces of clay particles become negatively charged. This allows the particles to bind with ionic minerals, such as magnesium, sodium, calcium, and potassium (1159). The content of trace minerals in individual products depends upon the rock source used (1159).\nDietary effect\nProponents claim that, due to mineral depletion of soil, many people do not take in the dietary trace minerals once plentiful in the human diet (1158). However, there is no evidence that there is increased bioavailability of ingested minerals in this form (1159)."

    "Colloidal Silver": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Colloidal silver is a suspension of microscopic silver particles in a colloidal base (8148, 44840, 92140). Silver has no known physiological function and is not an essential mineral (44536, 92140). Colloidal silver was formerly available as an over-the-counter medicine, and was used as a wound antiseptic and antimicrobial agent until modern antibiotics became available. However, in 1999 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ruling that there is no evidence for the safety or effectiveness of colloidal silver products. Colloidal silver products marketed for medical purposes are considered misbranded (14255, 14256, 44583, 44607).",
            "Warnings": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using colloidal silver for COVID-19. Additionally, colloidal silver can be unsafe. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally, topically, or intravenously. Total daily silver intake should not exceed 14 mcg/kg daily, or 980 mcg daily for a 70 kg person. Combining colloidal silver supplements with regular dietary intake of silver would likely result in exceeding this amount of silver. Silver accumulates in the body and can lead to an irreversible bluish skin discoloration known as argyria. Additionally, diffuse silver deposition in visceral organs has been reported, and toxic effects on the neurological, hematopoietic, hepatic, and cardiovascular systems can occur. (5525, 8148, 8149, 10647, 10648, 12092, 92137, 92138, 92139, 102575)(115303). In 1999, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ruled that there is no evidence for the safety or effectiveness of colloidal silver products (14255, 92137).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally, topically, or intravenously. Silver appears to cross the placenta (92140). Epidemiological evidence links increased silver levels to developmental anomalies of the ear, face, and neck (5525). Colloidal silver supplements can also lead to silver accumulation and an irreversible bluish skin discoloration known as argyria. Neurological deficits and diffuse silver deposition in visceral organs can also occur (5525, 5526, 8148, 8149, 10647, 10648, 12092, 92137, 92138, 92139).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, topically, or via inhalation, colloidal silver can cause serious adverse effects.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nAll routes of administration: An irreversible deposition of silver in the skin and mucous membranes with chronic use or high doses can cause a grey-blue discoloration known as argyria. Colloidal silver has also been associated with vision loss and organ damage.\nDermatologic\nOrally, topically, or via inhalation, long-term use of colloidal silver can lead to an irreversible deposition of silver compounds in the mucous membranes, skin, and nails. This condition, which is known as argyria, has been described in numerous case reports (5525, 8148, 8149, 10647, 10648, 12092, 44474, 44493, 44498, 44501)(44514, 44523, 44528, 44538, 44540, 44547, 44593, 44638, 44649, 44726)(44788, 44825, 44815, 92137, 92138, 92139, 96760, 102571, 102572, 102573)(102575, 112289). Argyria is characterized by a blueish-gray discoloration which occurs when the silver compounds from colloidal silver are reduced to elemental silver (44474, 92139). Since sunlight catalyzes the reduction of silver compounds to elemental silver, sun exposed regions are usually most affected (92138, 92139). The blueish-gray discoloration also occurs because colloidal silver can stimulate melanin production in skin (92139). Argyria typically first appears in the gingiva with a slate-blue silver line (5525). It can also occur in the fingernails, where it may be an early sign of silver ingestion and is also known as azure lunula (8149, 10648, 112289). Argyria usually occurs after ingestion of 4-5 grams of colloidal silver (92138). Although the blueish-gray discoloration associated with argyria is permanent, laser treatment may be used to lighten the skin (92139).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally and intravenously, hematologic effects have been reported. .In one case, a 30‐year‐old female experienced severe anemia and leukopenia with elevated serum ferritin after receiving 48 infusions with a specific colloidal silver marketed for oral use (Argentyn 23). The infusions provided silver 883 mg and were administered over 3 months. The patient was treated for anemia with oral copper, as well as four apheresis treatments. Similar symptoms occurred in other females who were treated with oral copper and repeated blood transfusions (102570). In another case, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia were reported in an older, healthy female following oral ingestion of 150 mcg of colloidal silver daily for 14-21 days. Treatment required hospitalization, blood transfusions, fluids, and intramuscular vitamin B12 (115303). The anemia associated with colloidal silver is related to a decline in serum levels of copper, which is needed for the production of hemoglobin (102570).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally and intravenously, hepatotoxicity has been reported. A 64-year-old male experienced cholelithiasis with acute encephalopathy after repeated oral dosing with colloidal silver providing 2838 ppm of silver over 4 hours (102572). In another case, an older, healthy female had abnormal liver tests, including elevated total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase after ingesting 150 mcg of colloidal silver daily for 2 to 3 weeks (115303). Intravenously, elevated liver enzymes, up to 150 times normal, have been reported in a 30‐year‐old female who received 48 infusions with a specific colloidal silver marketed for oral use (Argentyn 23) providing silver 883 mg over 3 months (102570).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nAt least two cases of myoclonic seizures have been reported after the use of homemade colloidal silver preparations (44485, 44649). In one case, myoclonic status epilepticus and coma occurred secondary to consumption of a homemade colloidal silver drink (Schaffer's Health Center Ltd., Unity). The patient had consumed at least one ounce daily for 4 months. The seizures did not respond to benzodiazepines, valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or propofol. The patient required mechanical ventilation and remained in a coma in the intensive care unit for 50 days (44485). In another case, myoclonic seizures and aspiration pneumonia occurred in a 75-year-old male who ingested \"several spoons\" of homemade colloidal silver up to 4 times daily whenever he \"felt a cold coming on\" for 4 years. The seizures were treated with clonazepam, and after being hospitalized for 2 months, he was discharged to a nursing home (44649). A more recent case report describes a 70-year-old male hospitalized after exhibiting expressive aphasia, focal seizure followed by generalized seizure, hypertension, encephalopathy, and an abnormal electroencephalogram. The patient had been self-medicating with colloidal silver 1 ounce daily, and blood tests revealed silver levels nearly 16 times that of normal. Extensive tests could not identify any other probable cause other than the silver use. The patient recovered and was discharged on levetiracetam, which was well tolerated at 2 months follow-up. The colloidal silver was a home-made electrolysis preparation using direct current, silver anodes, and steam distilled water (112290).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nChronic ingestion or inhalation of colloidal silver may cause silver deposition in the eye. This condition is known as ocular argyrosis, which is characterized by a blueish-gray discoloration of the eye (44514, 102571). In one case report, chronic use of oral colloidal silver over 9 years resulted in a 2-week history of loss of vision in one eye (102571). Topically, use of eye drops containing colloidal silver can also cause this condition (44821). In one report, a case of ocular argyrosis reportedly occurred in a patient with long-standing herpetic keratitis after only one treatment with eye drops consisting of a 1% solution of colloidal silver (44822).\nless\nOncologic\nOrally, chronic intake of colloidal silver over a 10-year period may have caused bone marrow damage, possibly contributing to the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia in a 72-year-old male. The patient died of respiratory failure related to recurrent pneumonia (102574).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, glomerulonephritis has been reported in a 47-year-old female who took colloidal silver to treat her T-cell lymphoma.

Other potential mechanisms of action include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anesthetic effects (98602). Animal research also suggests that oral or topical colocynth has analgesic effects. In a rat model of diabetic neuropathy, colocynth fruit powder improved measures of pain, possibly through antioxidant and hypoglycemic effects (108886).\nAntidiabetic effects\nColocynth is traditionally used for diabetes and has shown blood glucose lowering effects in clinical trials (98599, 98604). These effects have also been shown in animal models given extracts of various plant parts and may relate to an increase in insulin release (98599).\nAntitubercular effects\nColocynth is used traditionally for tuberculosis. In vitro, colocynth fruit extract had inhibitory effects on the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The inhibitory effects were found to be related to the constituent usrolic acid and cucurbitacins (98603).\nHypolipidemic effects\nThe hypolipidemic effects of colocynth might be related to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by the constituent flavonoids or cucurbitane-type triterpene glycosides (98600).\nLaxative effects\nColocynth is traditionally used for constipation. The cucurbitacins in colocynth are irritating to the gastric mucosa (2)."

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nToxicity from comfrey is believed to be related to its pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) constituents. Chronic toxicity appears as asthenia and progressive ascites, which may lead to liver failure. This may occur as late as 2 years after the initial ingestion. Other signs and symptoms of PA toxicity include bile duct proliferation, fatty changes of the liver, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and vascular lesions (11988). The mortality associated with comfrey toxicity is 50%. However, specific toxic levels seem to vary among individuals (11990).\nTreatment\nThe pyrrole metabolites of PAs are excreted as N-acetyl cysteine conjugates. Although some researchers speculate that early administration of N-acetyl cysteine might reduce toxicity, this has not been well studied (11988).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Metabolism\nThe pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) constituents of comfrey are biologically inert. However, they are metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, specifically by CYP3A4, to toxic dehydroalkaloids and pyrroles. Metabolism is also affected by pregnane X receptor induction of CYP3A4. Genetic or drug-induced variation in CYP3A4 or pregnane X receptor activity can affect the degree of PA toxicity by increasing metabolism (12841, 12842).\nExcretion\nThe pyrrole metabolites of PAs found in comfrey are excreted as N-acetyl cysteine conjugates (11988).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of comfrey are the leaf, rhizome, and root. Comfrey contains symphytine, lasiocarpine, and other pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) that are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic. The root contains allantoin, as well as rosmarinic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, chlorogenic, and p-coumaric acids (99068).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAllantoin and other constituents of comfrey induce anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor (NF) kappa B, and nitric oxide synthase. They may also affect cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression (99068).\nHepatotoxic effects\nHepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) found in comfrey cause sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. They destroy and damage centrilobular hepatocytes of the liver and also destroy small branches of the hepatic vein. PAs can also damage the lungs, resulting in pulmonary hypertension (11987, 11988, 11990). The PA content of comfrey varies with time of harvesting and plant age. The roots have 10 times higher concentrations of PAs than the leaves (11990, 11991).\nWound-healing effects\nComfrey root extract, and its constituent allantoin, have stimulatory effects on skin fibroblast cell metabolism and viability, which may promote wound healing. The extract also has antioxidant activity, which may counter the effects of reactive oxygen species in the skin that can damage healthy cells (99068)."

This isomer of CLA, as well as a mixture of CLA isomers, seems to increase plasma triglyceride levels, the ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to HDL cholesterol, and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (45148, 45468), although not all research has identified these effects (107475).\n\nA meta-analysis of 6 randomized, controlled trials shows that administration of CLA in individuals who are overweight or obese significantly increases lipoprotein (a) levels, a value associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Subgroup analyses suggest this increase is more prominent in trials that are longer than 6 months in duration and with CLA doses of at least 3.5 grams daily (107475).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, CLA has been shown to increase insulin resistance and glucose concentrations, as well as decrease insulin sensitivity in some patients, including obese individuals or patients with type 2 diabetes (2821, 13026, 45145, 45152, 45513). Some evidence suggests that this effect is isomer-specific and occurs with only the t10,c12 isomer (2821, 13026), while other evidence shows that decreased insulin sensitivity may also occur with the c9,t11 isomer or with a 50:50 mixture of c9,t11 and t10,c12 isomers (45145, 45152).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, the most common adverse effect reported with CLA is gastrointestinal upset including diarrhea, constipation, nausea, loose stools, dyspepsia, bloating, and flatulence (3153, 4947, 45280, 45705, 45730, 111056). Esophageal irritation was reported in one patient who bit open and swallowed a capsule containing CLA (45577).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, clinical research shows that CLA 3 grams daily for 12 weeks does not affect liver outcome measures (105809). However, there are at least two case reports of hepatotoxicity. Asthenia, jaundice, and pruritus were reported in a 46-year-old female who consumed CLA for two weeks. Abnormal liver enzyme levels returned to normal following discontinuation of CLA supplementation (45483). Hepatotoxicity, presenting as fulminant hepatitis and characterized by anorexia, nausea, jaundice, choluria, and hepatic encephalopathy requiring liver transplantation has also been reported in a 63-year-old female taking a CLA-containing weight-loss supplement for one month (91589).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, CLA has been reported to cause back ache in one individual in one clinical trial (45787).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, CLA may cause headache or fatigue (3153, 45787).

However, oral CLA alone does not seem to reduce blood pressure.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that taking CLA in doses of 1 gram to 10.8 grams daily does not lower systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo or a control diet (111053). However, this analysis is limited by the heterogeneous populations in the individual studies. Only one study was specifically conducted in individuals with hypertension (45569). This small clinical trial in individuals with stage one uncontrolled hypertension shows that taking CLA 4.5 grams daily along with ramipril 37.5 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with ramipril alone (45569).\nless\nObesity. In adults and children, oral CLA seems to decrease fat mass by a small amount, including abdominal fat mass. However, it is unclear if oral CLA is beneficial for weight loss, body mass index (BMI) reduction, or improvement of metabolic measures.\nTaking CLA 3-6.8 grams daily seems to decrease body fat mass, increase lean body mass, and reduce waist and hip circumference in some patients (2819, 3153, 4947, 13137, 45295, 45303, 45685, 45799, 97003, 105809). A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with overweight or obesity also undergoing an exercise program shows a small effect on body fat reduction, but not body weight or plasma lipids (111056). Most research suggests that doses greater than 3.4 grams daily do not seem to offer any additional benefit when compared with lower doses (2819, 2821, 3153, 4947, 10410, 11327, 13137, 45295, 45799). Also, supplementing milk with CLA 3 grams daily seems to reduce total fat mass in individuals with overweight when compared with placebo (45331). CLA also seems to reduce hunger and improve satiety and feelings of fullness, but this appetite suppression does not necessarily result in a lower energy intake or improved body weight maintenance (11327). In children with overweight aged 6-10 years, taking CLA 3 grams daily for approximately 7 months seems to reduce body fat, abdominal fat, and peripheral fat percentages when compared with placebo (45713).\n\nThere is inconsistent evidence regarding the effects of CLA on body weight and BMI, with most research suggesting that CLA does not reduce total body weight or BMI (2819, 2821, 3153, 10410, 13137, 45007, 45679, 45790, 97003, 97006). Also, taking CLA in combination with omega-3 fatty acids or chromium picolinate does not seem to improve BMI and body weight in individuals with overweight or obesity (42627, 45431). Although one meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking CLA 2.4-6 grams daily for 6-12 months increases weight loss by 0.7 kg and fat loss by 1.3 kg when compared with placebo, this effect is small and may not be clinically significant (91585). Also, taking CLA 3.4 grams daily for 1 year does not seem to prevent weight or body fat regain in individuals with overweight who previously lost some of their initial body weight (45083, 45221). However, one study shows that taking CLA 8 grams daily for 16 weeks seems to reduce BMI in obese, postmenopausal adults with type 2 diabetes (45614).\n\nSome studies have evaluated the consumption of CLA-enriched fatty foods. In males with overweight, consuming butter enriched with CLA does not seem to have beneficial metabolic effects (45192). Also, in individuals with overweight or obesity, consuming a goat cheese naturally enriched in CLA and omega-3 fatty acids for 12 weeks does not seem to improve BMI, fat mass, or weight, or most metabolic measures, including fasting glucose, blood pressure, or inflammatory factors, when compared to a control goat cheese. However, there was an increase in total cholesterol, possibly related to an increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and reduced levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (105808).\n\nThere is evidence that the isolated trans-10,cis-12 isomer of CLA can increase hyperproinsulinemia and insulin resistance in patients with abdominal obesity (2821, 13026, 13137). Hyperproinsulinemia is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, CLA might not be a good choice for obese patients. However, most commercial CLA products contain a mixture of CLA isomers. It is not known if these mixed CLA isomer products carry this risk. One meta-analysis of clinical research shows that insulin resistance is modestly reduced when a CLA supplement is taken by adults undergoing an exercise program when compared with exercise alone (111056).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCommon cold. Oral CLA does not seem to be beneficial for common cold prevention or treatment.\nSome clinical research shows that taking CLA 2 grams daily does not reduce the risk of developing a cold or reduce cough or sore throat severity in individuals with a common cold when compared with placebo (45577).\nless\nDiabetes. Oral CLA does not seem to be beneficial for diabetes.\nSome clinical research shows that taking CLA 6.4 grams daily for 16 weeks does not improve fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, or insulin in individuals with type 2 diabetes when compared with safflower oil (45614, 45835).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral CLA does not seem to be beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis and individual clinical trials show that taking CLA as supplements or fortified foods does not improve levels of cholesterol or triglycerides (45790, 97006, 111054). One meta-analysis of small clinical trials in heterogenous populations shows that taking CLA does not improve levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides, and modestly DECREASES levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with taking placebo or a control diet (111054). CLA has generally been taken in doses of 1.4 to 6.8 grams daily for up to 24 weeks (45790, 97006, 111054). However, research in patients with hyperlipidemia is limited. Most studies have included general populations of healthy adults, patient with type 2 diabetes, or populations with obesity.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral CLA is beneficial for reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis.\nClinical research shows that taking CLA 2 grams daily for 12 weeks improves overall well-being in patients with birch pollen allergy when compared with placebo, but does not improve eye or total allergy symptoms (45395).\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral CLA is beneficial for reducing symptoms of asthma.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mild asthma shows that taking CLA 4.5 grams daily for 12 weeks improves airway hypersensitivity and tolerance to strenuous exercise when compared with placebo, but without significantly reducing the need to use rescue bronchodilators or improving lung capacity (45787). In addition, a small clinical trial in children 6-18 years of age with allergic asthma shows that taking CLA 3 grams daily for 12 weeks does not reduce the use of emergency bronchodilators or improve peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume (FEV1), or vital lung capacity when compared with placebo (97005).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. Although there is interest in using oral CLA for preventing atherosclerosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of CLA for this purpose.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral CLA is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nSome preliminary clinical research in student athletes shows that taking CLA powder (CLAce Powder, The Nisshin OilliO Group, Ltd.) 900 mg daily for 14 days increases time to exhaustion during exercise by an average of 179 seconds, but does not reduce rate of perceived exertion, when compared with placebo (97002). Other small clinical trials show that taking a specific product containing CLA oil (Clarinol A-80, Stepan Specialty Products, LLC) 5.63 grams daily for 6 weeks in combination with aerobic training does not improve muscle endurance, muscle power, peak oxygen uptake, or cardiorespiratory fatigue threshold when compared with placebo in untrained to moderately trained males (91587, 91588).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if dietary CLA is beneficial for preventing breast cancer.\nSome observational research has found that a higher intake of CLA in foods, particularly cheese, is linked with a lower risk of developing breast cancer in postmenopausal individuals (5058). However, other population research has found that intake of CLA is not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (45609). Furthermore, some epidemiological evidence has found that CLA intake might be weakly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (45048).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral CLA is beneficial for improving cognitive function in older adults.\nPreliminary clinical research in older adults shows that taking CLA 1.75 grams twice daily for 6 weeks may modestly improve verbal learning and recall in males, but not females, when compared with placebo (97008).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if dietary CLA is beneficial for preventing colorectal cancer.\nEpidemiological research has found that high dietary intake of CLA might reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in females by up to 39% (13775). It is not known if taking CLA supplements is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral CLA is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nEvidence from a small clinical trial shows that taking CLA 3 grams daily orally for 90 days, along with a hypocaloric diet, decreases body fat mass by approximately 3% when compared to baseline in females with metabolic syndrome. However, this reduction does not appear to be significant when compared with placebo treatment, and CLA does not lower blood lipid levels or blood pressure (91586).\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral CLA is beneficial for increasing muscle strength.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that adding CLA 6 grams to supplementation with creatine 9 grams and whey protein 36 grams daily for 12 weeks modestly enhances strength improvement and lean tissue mass when compared with placebo in adults participating in strength training (45596). However, other clinical research shows that taking CLA 5 grams daily for 7 weeks does not improve most measures of strength in adults participating in resistance training when compared with placebo, although bench press strength was modestly improved in males, and lean tissue mass and fat mass were also improved (45222). Other clinical research shows that taking CLA 6 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve body composition or strength in resistance-trained athletes (45041). The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear, but may be related to the duration of treatment.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral CLA is beneficial for NAFLD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking CLA (Nutrifit, Nutricentury) 1 gram three times daily in conjunction with a weight loss diet for 8 weeks reduces fat mass, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and increases muscle mass when compared with a weight loss diet alone in obese adults with NAFLD.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAnimal research suggests that the c9,t11 and t10,c12 isomers of CLA are absorbed similarly, with both isomers absorbed slower than linoleic acid (45340).\nMetabolism\nIn vitro research shows that CLA is metabolized to beta-oxidation products and elongation products (45203, 45226).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCLA refers to a group of conjugated dienoic isomers of linoleic acid, including cis-9,trans-11 linoleic acid and trans-10,cis-12 linoleic acid. Different isomers seem to have different physiological effects (3158, 13069, 45831). Dairy products and beef are the major dietary sources. Food sources provide both isomers, but typically contain more of the cis-9,trans-11 isomer in a ratio of 30-70:1. Supplements containing CLA usually provide the two isomers in a 50:50 ratio (13069). Plant oils contain only small amounts of CLA. Plant oils are good sources of linoleic acid, but in humans, linoleic acid does not seem to be converted to CLA in significant amounts (5933, 13069). CLA can also be produced synthetically by exposing oils rich in linoleic acid, such as safflower and soybean, to a base and heat. This CLA product is high in both the cis-9, trans-11 and the trans-10,cis-12 isomers (3001).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nHuman research suggests that CLA decreases serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9, an enzyme involved in the inflammatory process in the lungs. However, there was no effect on another inflammatory enzyme, MMP 2 (99918). Animal research shows that CLA might reduce inflammation by reducing superoxide production by macrophages and heterophils (45084). CLA may also suppress the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, possibly by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma (45164, 45214, 45446, 45772). A meta-analysis of human research shows that taking CLA reduces levels of both IL-6 and TNF-alpha (111057). These cytokines are associated with inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, atherosclerosis, or cancer (45164, 45772). CLA may also reduce levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma in peripheral mononuclear cells (45617). In contrast, a meta-analysis of human research shows that taking CLA increases levels of C-reactive protein. Also, taking the trans-10,cis-12 CLA isomer modestly increases levels of TNF-alpha (111057).\nAntiaging effect\nIn vitro research shows that CLA can increase the synthesis of type I collagen, indicating a potential anti-aging effect (45497).\nAntiallergic effects\nAnimal research shows that the cis-9,trans-11 isomer of CLA can inhibit allergic sensitization and airway inflammation via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma-related mechanism. PPAR-gamma is a nuclear transcription factor that reduces immune responses and the production of inflammatory mediators when activated (45463).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research shows that CLA can inhibit foodborne and pathogenic bacteria, including Gram-positive strains (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans) and Gram-negative strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis) (45574).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in using CLA for cancer prevention. Preliminary research shows that CLA can inhibit the growth and proliferation of squamous cell, breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, and melanoma cancer (5927, 8997, 45003, 45022, 45027, 45097, 45129, 45163, 45205, 45208)(45347, 45816, 45821). Other preliminary research shows that CLA induces apoptosis in bladder, colorectal, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, breast, and prostate cancer cells (44958, 45065, 45123, 45129, 45205, 45218, 45230, 45398).\n\nVarious mechanisms have been suggested for the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of CLA based on in vitro or animal research. CLA appears to selectively inhibit the proliferation of estrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast cancer cells over ER negative cells, suggesting that CLA has antiestrogenic activity (45124, 45823). CLA also appears to up-regulate the expression of the estrogen-regulated tumor suppressor gene protein tyrosine phosphatase gamma (PTPgamma), which has been shown to be lower in breast cancer than in normal breast cells (45216). In addition, CLA appears to inhibit the activity of lipoxygenase and reduce the production of lipoxygenase metabolites, such as 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), which are known to promote breast cancer proliferation or prevent breast cancer cell apoptosis (45165, 45201, 45819). In breast cancer and osteosarcoma cells, CLA seems to increase expression of p53 and/or Bax proteins, both of which induce apoptosis, and reduce the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), a protein that inhibits apoptosis (45287, 45398, 45464). In breast and colon cancer cells, CLA appears to reduce the production and signaling of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a lipid compound that promotes cancer progression (45078, 45129, 45232). In prostate cancer cells, CLA seems to induce apoptosis by increasing protein kinase C (PKC)-delta and decreasing PKC-iota abundance (45153). However, in breast cancer cells CLA does not appear to affect PKC isoenzymes (44958). In colon cancer cells, CLA appears to inhibit growth by decreasing the secretion of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) and downregulating the signaling of ErbB3 (45038, 45067, 45109). CLA also appears to downregulate the signaling of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which increases apoptosis, in colon, bladder, and breast cancer cells (45089, 45560, 45703). In various cancer cell lines, CLA appears to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma (44983, 45185).\n\nIn addition to antiproliferative and apoptotic effects, CLA also appears to reduce the metastasis of breast, gastrointestinal, colon, and prostate cancers (5927, 44971, 45193).\nAntidiabetic effects\nCLA has been shown to have both positive and negative effects on glucose metabolism. Some animal research shows that CLA can improve insulin sensitivity by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma (44997, 45419). Other animal research shows that CLA can enhance glucose tolerance and decrease insulin resistance by increasing fat oxidation and energy expenditure (45158, 45289). Also, CLA appears to attenuate palmitate-induced insulin resistance by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (45584). However, other in vitro and animal research shows that CLA can induce insulin resistance, possibly by decreasing production and secretion of leptin and adiponectin (45244, 45272, 45440). A meta-analysis of human research shows that taking CLA has no effect on adiponectin in a mixed population; however, in females, taking CLA modestly increases levels of adiponectin (111057).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn human research, CLA modestly reduced levels of malondialdehyde, a biomarker for oxidative stress (99918, 111051, 111052, 111055). Some preliminary evidence shows that CLA can reduce lipid peroxidation (45179). Lipid peroxidation is associated with inflammatory diseases and atherogenesis (45112). CLA also appears to inhibit the activity of NADPH oxidase, an enzyme that contributes to the production of reactive oxygen species (45301). However, meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking CLA does not seem to affect most markers of oxidative stress (111051, 111052, 111055). Also, some research shows that CLA may function as an oxidant (45293, 45339, 45394, 45417, 45568, 111051, 111055).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome evidence suggests that CLA may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular-related outcomes. Epidemiological research suggests that increased levels of CLA in adipose tissue are associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction (45756). Evidence from animal research shows that CLA reduces blood pressure, possibly by decreasing secretion of hypertensive adipocytokines (45081, 45415, 45695).\n\nOther animal research shows that CLA improves cholesterol levels by lowering cholesterol absorption and reducing the activity of hepatic and intestinal acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). ACAT is an enzyme that converts excess cholesterol to cholesteryl esters (45066, 45119, 45197, 45302, 45386). The conversion cholesterol to cholesterol esters and subsequent accumulation mark the early stages of atherosclerosis (91584). In addition, evidence from in vitro research shows that CLA may exert its hypolipidemic effect through enhanced beta-oxidation of fatty acids (44967). Also, CLA appears to reduce the secretion of triglycerides and apolipoprotein B100, a protein needed for the production of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), from liver cells (45009, 45174). CLA also appears to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, which regulates cholesterol homeostasis and can reduce cholesterol accumulation in macrophage foam cells (45102, 45133, 45170, 45491, 99919). In human research, the activation of PPAR-gamma was thought to play a role in the increase of the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Increases in this fatty acid are associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (99919). The ability of CLA to activate PPAR-gamma has also been shown to inhibit the migration of monocytes and reduce the inflammatory output of macrophages, which may help reduce the development or promote the regression of atherosclerotic plaque (45718). In addition, the activation of PPAR-gamma by CLA also appears to reduce the formation of collagen by vascular smooth muscle cells. The formation and deposition of collagen by vascular smooth muscle cells has been associated with atherosclerosis development (45409). CLA also seems to induce interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), an anti-inflammatory mediator that is associated with decreased risk of coronary heart disease (45600).\n\nSome preliminary research shows that CLA inhibits platelet aggregation and the formation of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), suggesting that CLA may have antithrombotic properties (44956). Decreased platelet aggregation has been shown in preliminary clinical research (45607). However, evidence from other preliminary clinical research suggests that CLA does not affect antithrombotic parameters, prothrombin time, activated partial prothrombin time, antithrombin III levels, or bleeding times (44998).\nDermatologic effects\nAnimal research shows that CLA may modify fatty acid composition of skin and decreased thickness of subcutaneous but not dermis tissue (45093). In vitro research shows that CLA can modulate ultraviolet radiation-induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-8 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), potentially resulting in photoprotection (45284).\nFertility effects\nSome animal research shows that CLA may increase the probability of pregnancy and decrease time to conception in dairy cows (45603). The mechanism may involve improved ovarian follicular steroidogenesis and increased circulating concentrations of IGF-I (45343). However, other animal research shows that CLA does not affect ovulation (45583).\nGastrointestinal effects\nA small crossover study in adults of various weights shows that a single dose of 6.25 grams of CLA in vegetable oil does not affect energy intake, feelings of hunger or fullness, or postprandial peptide YY concentrations (105709).\n\nThere is also interest in using CLA for inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions. Some animal research suggests that CLA improves inflammation in colitis, potentially through activation of PPAR-gamma (45698).\nHepatic effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that CLA can reduce carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis (45350). This effect may result from the ability of CLA reduce the viability of hepatic stellate cells. These cells produce collagen in the liver, which is associated with liver fibrosis (45350). Other animal research shows that CLA can reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, possibly by increasing lipid utilization by peripheral tissues (45276, 45796). However, increased hepatic steatosis and increased hepatic liver triglyceride levels has been observed in other animal studies (45359, 45397). Also, a meta-analysis of human research in various adult populations shows that taking CLA does not reduce levels of the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (111052).\nHormonal effects\nIn animal research, CLA reduced parathyroid hormone in male, but not female, rats (45439).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nCLA appears to increase levels of immunoglobulins, including immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA (44990, 45500, 45525, 45564, 45792, 45828); increase peripheral blood mononuclear cell production (2810); increase phagocytic activity of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells (45252, 45723); and inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways in tumor cells (5926, 5934). CLA might also modulate cellular response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (5924).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that CLA can prevent age-associated bone loss and age-associated bone marrow adiposity (45242, 45589, 45789). CLA appears to lower the ex vivo production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in bone organ culture, indicating a potential mechanism by which CLA may lower bone resorption (44959, 45100, 45151, 45161).\n\nSome evidence from animal research shows that CLA can increase bone mineral content in young animals (45532). In vitro research shows that CLA may increase alkaline phosphate activity in osteoblast-like cell lines, indicating a potential mechanism by which CLA may increase bone formation (45161, 45259). However, epidemiological research suggests that dietary CLA is not associated with increased bone mineral density in the hip, lumbar spine, or whole body, although it appears to be associated with increased bone mineral density in the forearm (45182).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nIn vitro research shows that CLA can protect cortical neurons from excitotoxicity, possibly by stabilizing mitochondrial function (45785).\nRenal effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that CLA may reduce renal injury but not improve renal function associated with polycystic kidney disease (45492). Other animal research shows that CLA may reduce glomerular enlargement and lower renal cyclooxygenase-2 levels in an obese rat model, suggesting that CLA may help prevent obesity-related nephropathy (45534).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is a lot of interest in using CLA for weight loss in obesity. Researchers think that CLA might reduce body fat deposits by promoting lipolysis and apoptosis in adipose tissue (3070, 5928, 44982, 45155, 45279, 45704, 45824). Researchers also think that CLA might reduce fat accumulation by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase and stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase in adipocytes (45006, 45068), as well as activating PPAR-gamma and stimulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines (45025, 45056, 91585). CLA might also inhibit the proliferation and induce differentiation of preadipocyte cells (45077, 45125). It might also inhibit lipogenesis and decrease triglyceride production in adipocytes and adipose tissue (44960, 45011, 45050, 45062, 45128, 45167). Human research shows that changes in body composition are associated with changes in plasma levels of compounds associated with lipid and energy metabolism (111050).\n\nThe effects of CLA on hormones involved in appetite have also been investigated. Preliminary animal research shows that CLA intake reduces food intake by decreasing the expression of neuropeptides Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) (45299). However, a meta-analysis of human research shows that taking CLA has no effect on leptin in a mixed population. Also, taking CLA seems to decrease leptin levels in some populations, including females (111057).\n\nThere is some evidence that only the trans-10,cis-12 isomer has an effect on body fat mass (3001). Additional evidence, however, shows the isolated trans-10,cis-12 isomer might also cause hyperproinsulinemia, increase insulin resistance and glycemia, reduce high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in men with abdominal obesity, and increase lipid peroxidation and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (2821, 13026, 13137).\nWound-healing effects\nIn animal research, CLA improved wound closure rate during the early stage of wound healing. Oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were also reduced (45810)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCopaiba balsam is an oleoresin sourced from the trunk of Copaifera species trees (11, 102011). It contains approximately 40% ent-polyalthic acid and 15% ent-agathic acid (102010). It also contains sesquiterpenes and diterpenes in quantities that depend on the growing conditions, species, location, and harvest times (102011, 104756, 110642). The resin fraction of copaiba balsam contains the kaurene, labdane, and clerodane types of diterpenes, including copalic, agathic, kaurenoic, and ent-polyalthic acids (102010). The chemical composition of volatile compounds of Copaiba balsam varies widely depending on tree species, location, season, light level, soil nutrients, pathogens, and many other factors (110642).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that topical application of copaiba balsam may reduce dermal pain caused by ultraviolet B radiation when compared with no intervention or placebo cream. Researchers have suggested this reduction in pain is a result of the anti-inflammatory activity of beta-caryophyllene, a constituent of copaiba balsam (104756). Copaiba balsam reduced the formation of edema, exudate volume, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a rat model of inflammation. Researchers suggest that the volatile compound beta-bisabolene in copaiba balsam reduces vascular permeability, inhibiting the formation of edema and the subsequent production and migration of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and prostaglandin E2 (110642).\nAntimicrobial effects\nCrude copaiba balsam and the compounds ent-kaurenic acid and kolavenic acid from its acidic fraction have in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Ent-copalic acid and ent-kaurenoic acid have activity against Bacillus subtilis. Ent-copalic aicd is also active against Streptococcal species, Lactobacillus casei, and Trypanosoma cruzi. Ent-polyalthic acid, the main diterpenoid isolated from copaiba balsam, has activity against the fungi Tricophyton rubrum and Tricophyton mentagrophytes. It also has schistosomicidal activity (102011).\nChemopreventive effects\nThe oleoresin from Copaifera reticulata and its major constituent ent-polyalthic acid reduce DNA damage and pre-neoplastic lesions induced by dimethylhydrazine in a rat colon cancer model (102010). Copaiba balsam also reduces the rate of cell division in tumor tissue (102010). Possible mechanisms for the chemopreventive effects include antioxidant effects of constituents such as beta-bisabolene, and binding of diterpenes to nitric oxide synthase, which reduces production of nitric oxide (102010).\nCytotoxic effects\nCopaiba balsam and its neutral and acidic fractions have no cytotoxic activity against colorectal adenocarcinoma, malignant melanoma, colon cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer cell lines in vitro. They also have no cytotoxic effects against human keratinocytes (102011).\nWound-healing effects\nAnimal research shows that applying a 10% copaiba balsam preparation to experimentally-induced skin lesions for 14 days produces anti-inflammatory effects, reduces skin edema, hyperplasia, and wound area, and increases angiogenesis and re-epithelialization, when compared with untreated controls (107379)."

However, in healthy breastfed infants age 6-9 months, iron supplements do not appear to affect copper absorption (92396). The effects of copper on non-heme iron absorption in adults is also unclear. In healthy adult females, taking solutions containing copper sulfate with ferrous sulfate, providing 0.5 mg elemental iron and copper-to-iron molar ratios between 0.5:1 and 8:1, does not seem to affect iron absorption at any copper dose (92398). However, in a similar population, giving these same doses in capsule formulations with the addition of ascorbic acid is associated with a reduction in iron absorption at the highest copper dose (8:1 Cu:Fe molar ratio) only (95539). The reason for these disparate findings is unclear. However, this interaction is unlikely to occur at typical dietary copper levels, or at doses usually found in supplements.\nless\nVITAMIN C\nTheoretically, taking vitamin C with copper might reduce the absorption of copper.\nClinical research in young males shows that taking vitamin C 1500 mg daily decreases serum levels of copper and the copper transport protein, ceruloplasmin (710).

It is unlikely that this is clinically significant unless dietary copper intake is low (710).\nless\nZINC\nTaking large amounts of zinc with copper reduces the absorption of copper. Theoretically, this combination might reduce the absorption of zinc.\nLarge amounts of zinc can inhibit copper absorption due to competition for absorption from the gut (706, 707, 708). Toxic levels of zinc intake can cause significant copper deficiency and associated anemia (706).

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nCopper toxicity may occur when the tolerable upper intake levels (UL) are exceeded (7135). Copper toxicity is rare in humans, except in those with a hereditary defect in copper homeostasis (7135). Kidney failure and death can occur with ingestion of as little as 1 gram of copper sulfate (17). Symptoms of acute copper poisoning include abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, hypotension, hemolytic anemia, liver damage, uremia, and cardiovascular collapse (15, 159, 7135, 45865, 45887, 112378). The acute no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of copper in water has been determined to be 4 mg/L (7135, 45887).\n\nChronic copper toxicity can cause skin discoloration, sporadic fever, jaundice, hepatic failure, vomiting, epigastric pain, and diarrhea (159, 7136). In clinical research, water containing greater than 6 mg/L of copper was needed to cause significant gastrointestinal symptoms (45925).\nTreatment\nCopper toxicity is generally treated with chelating agents, such as penicillamine and dimercaprol (106019). A case of successful recovery from hemolysis after copper overdose using several plasmapheresis cycles is reported in a 28-year-old-male (112378). Details on the management of copper toxicity can be found in various medical guidelines.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nCopper is absorbed primarily from the small intestine via Caco-2 cells that contain a copper transport protein (Ctr1). It then enters the portal circulation (95539, 95917). Some studies suggest that fractional absorption of copper increases as intakes decrease (45933, 45960); however, other studies suggest no difference in the percent absorption (45905). In children, copper levels in the blood increase within 2 weeks with supplementation (87166). Copper can also be absorbed through the skin (45928).\nDistribution\nThe majority of copper in the body is in the skeleton and muscles; the liver maintains plasma copper concentrations (7135). In the blood, 85% to 95% of copper is bound to ceruloplasmin. The remainder is loosely bound to albumin, various peptides, and amino acids, and is available to enter cells and tissues. Measurement of this free copper gives a better assessment of copper status than the total copper level (95917).\nExcretion\nExcretion of copper into the gastrointestinal tract regulates copper homeostasis; greater excretion is the result of increased absorption (7135). Copper is excreted in the urine (46036).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCopper is an essential trace mineral. It is widely distributed in foods, particularly organ meats, seafood, nuts, seeds, wheat bran cereals, grain products, and cocoa products (7135).\n\nBiochemically, copper acts as a catalytic agent via the many copper metalloenzymes which act as oxidases (7135). Amine oxidases are important in a variety of processes including allergic reactions, serotonin and catecholamine degradation, and connective tissue development. Ferroxidases, copper enzymes in the plasma, are required for ferrous iron oxidation and binding of iron to transferrin. The main copper protein in plasma Ferroxidase I, also called ceruloplasmin, might have antioxidant functions. Another copper enzyme, cytochrome-c oxidase, is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water to fuel ATP synthesis. Cytochrome-c oxidase is most abundant in highly metabolic tissues, including the heart, brain, and liver. Other copper enzymes are responsible for precursors of dopa and melatonin formation, conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, production of amides, and protection from free radical damage (7135).\n\nThe activity of copper enzymes decreases with copper depletion (7135). Copper deficiency in humans is rare, but has been associated with excessive zinc intake, intestinal bypass surgery, parenteral nutrition, and malnourishment in infants (706, 707, 708). Copper deficiency is manifested by normocytic hypochromic anemia, leukopenia, and neutropenia (7135). In infants and children, osteoporosis may be seen (7135). No single lab test is available to determine copper deficiency. Diagnosis of copper deficiency is made by several indicators, including serum or plasma copper concentration, ceruloplasmin concentration, and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity (7135).\nBone effects\nIn older women, the inclusion of trace minerals, including copper, to a calcium-supplemented diet, results in the slowing of bone loss (1994). However, the mechanism of action is unclear as other studies in humans suggests no effect of copper on various markers of bone metabolism, including serum osteocalcin (a marker of bone formation), urinary creatinine concentration, the urinary pyridinoline-urinary creatinine ratio (a marker of bone resorption), and the deoxypyridinoline-urinary creatinine excretion ratio (a marker of bone resorption) (45868, 45884).\nConnective tissue effects\nPreliminary research suggests copper supplementation might reduce the formation of lupus erythematosus cells in animal models of collagen disease. However, copper supplementation doesn't seem to affect symptoms of the disease in humans (12953).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is evidence from observational studies that people with Alzheimer's disease have higher levels of free copper in their blood than people without the disease. This might lead to increased levels of free copper in the brain, increasing oxidative stress and contributing to neurologic damage (95917)."

Coral seems to act as an adequate carrier for bone growth factors. It seems to allow osteocyte attachment, growth, spreading, and differentiation. New bone and fibrovascular tissue grow within the implanted coral. Over time, the calcium carbonate framework is resorbed (10737, 10739, 10741).\n\nIn ovariectomized mice, adding coral calcium as 1% of the diet improves bone mineral density in the vertebrae, femur, and tibia when compared with ovariectomized mice not receiving calcium supplementation.

These products have combined cordyceps (CordyMax Cs-4) 1000 mg with rhodiola 300 mg (46091) or cordyceps (CordyMax Cs-4) 2000 mg with roseroot 600 mg (Optygen, First Endurance) (15573); liquid and powdered cordyceps formulations with reishi mushroom, shiitake mushroom, bamboo, and honey (Fohow oral liquid and Fohow lingzhi capsules, FOHOW Technology Investment Group Co. Ltd.) (98686); and cordyceps (form unknown) 1.2 grams with a 930 mg mixture of extracts of ashwagandha root, green tea leaf, rhodiola root, and astragalus root (Shroom Tech Sport, Onnit Labs) (105079).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nArrhythmia. Although there is interest in using oral cordyceps for arrhythmia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cordyceps for this condition.\nAsthma. Oral cordyceps has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children with asthma shows that a 619 mg capsule containing equal weights of the dried aqueous extracts of cordyceps, astragalus, skullcap, Radix stemonae, and Bulbus fritillariae daily for 6 months does not reduce the need for medication or improve symptoms when compared with placebo (32935).\nless\nAutoimmune thyroiditis. Oral cordyceps has only been evaluated in combination with other treatments; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical studies in China in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis shows that taking cordyceps up to 9 grams daily for up to 28 weeks in addition to a low-iodine diet or levothyroxine decreases circulating thyroid antibody levels including thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) when compared with a low-iodine diet or levothyroxine treatment alone. In the subgroup of patients with hypothyroidism, taking cordyceps with levothyroxine increases free thyroxine (FT4) but does not affect free triiodothyronine (FT3) or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels when compared with levothyroxine alone (113622).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). Meta-analyses of lower quality clinical studies suggest that oral cordyceps may modestly improve biomarkers in some patients with CKD.\nA meta-analysis of lower quality clinical studies in patients with CKD shows that taking cordyceps alone or with standard treatment improves markers of kidney function as shown by decreased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and 24-hour urinary protein, when compared with standard treatment alone. Most studies used doses of 0.6-2 grams three times daily for 1-6 months (116127). These findings align with earlier meta-analyses, which include some of the same studies, showing similar improvements in markers of kidney function when cordyceps is used alongside angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in patients with diabetic kidney disease (92829, 92830). Most studies used either Bailing (Cs-C-Q80) or Jinshuibao (Cs-4) fermented cordyceps mycelial products in doses of 0.5-6 grams three times daily for 1-6 months. However, the data are limited overall by high heterogeneity, methodological flaws, and short duration of follow-up.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Preliminary clinical studies suggest that oral cordyceps may modestly improve symptoms of COPD.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in patients with moderate or severe COPD shows that taking cordyceps alone or as part of a formulation containing other products for up to 12 months improves lung function and reduces the incidence of an acute exacerbation by a small amount. Also, the distance walked in 6 minutes is increased by about 45 meters, which was considered clinically meaningful. Most individual studies in this analysis used Bailing (Cs-C-Q80) or Jinshuibao (Cs-4), fermented cordyceps mycelial products, in combination with conventional treatments with conventional treatments alone (109705). This analysis is limited by the low methodological quality of the included studies.\nless\nContrast induced nephropathy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral cordyceps may modestly reduce contrast induced nephropathy.\nA preliminary clinical study in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking a specific cordyceps mycelial product (Corbrin; CS-C-Q80) 2-3 grams orally three times daily for 3 days before and after angiography reduces the risk of contrast induced nephropathy by about 48% to 66% when compared to standard treatment (92827). However, other preliminary clinical research in patients with stable angina pectoris shows that taking the same cordyceps product 3 grams orally three times daily for 3 days before and after angioplasty does not decrease the prevalence of contrast induced nephropathy when compared to standard therapy (92826). Reasons for these discrepancies are not clear but may relate to the small size and heterogenous populations in these studies.\nless\nCough. Although there is interest in using oral cordyceps for cough, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cordyceps for this purpose.\nDiabetic nephropathy. Early research suggests that oral cordyceps may modestly improve kidney function in patients with diabetic kidney disease.\nA meta-analysis of low to moderate quality clinical research in patients with diabetic kidney disease shows that taking cordyceps as adjunctive therapy to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for 2-24 weeks modestly improves kidney function when compared to these medications alone. Kidney function was based on markers such as blood creatinine and urea nitrogen, as well as urinary albumin and total protein. There were also modest improvements in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. There was no effect on glycemic indices. The effect of cordyceps on disease progression or cardiovascular events is unclear (111903). Additionally, a retrospective observational study in adults with diabetic nephropathy suggests that taking fermented cordyceps sinensis 3 grams daily along with valsartan 80 mg daily for 3 months significantly reduces fasting blood glucose and serum creatinine levels compared with valsartan alone (116129).\nless\nFatigue. Although there is interest in using oral cordyceps for fatigue, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cordyceps for this purpose.\nHepatitis B. Although there is interest in using oral cordyceps for hepatitis B, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cordyceps for this condition.\nHypercholesterolemia. Although there is interest in using oral cordyceps for hypercholesterolemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cordyceps for this condition.\nKidney failure. Some clinical studies suggest that oral cordyceps may improve markers of kidney function, inflammation, and nutritional status in patients on hemodialysis, but data are mixed for certain outcomes.\nA meta-analysis of small, mostly low-quality clinical trials conducted in China in patients with kidney failure on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis shows that taking cordyceps in addition to standard treatment modestly reduces serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, decreases markers of inflammation, and improves nutritional markers such as albumin when compared with control. The validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity.\n\nHowever, another meta-analysis of small clinical trials, some of which overlap with the meta-analysis described above, in patients in China on hemodialysis suggests that adding cordyceps to standard treatment does not seem to improve serum creatinine levels but may improve certain markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein, when compared with placebo.\n\nMost individual studies in these meta-analyses used Bailing (Cs-C-Q80) or Jinshuibao (Cs-4), fermented cordyceps mycelial products (105076).\nless\nKidney transplant. Small clinical studies suggest that oral cordyceps is no better than standard treatment in patients with kidney transplant.\nA meta-analysis of 4 heterogeneous clinical trials evaluating patients in China immediately post-kidney transplant or patients with complications post-kidney transplant suggests that adding cordyceps to standard therapy with cyclosporine and steroids is no better than adding azathioprine 50-150 mg for improving overall survival or graft survival or reducing rejection risk. However, there was a non-significant trend to reduced risk of graft rejection in the cordyceps group (95905). A higher quality systematic review, which determined the available studies were too heterogeneous to pool together in a meta-analysis, suggests that adding cordyceps 3-6 grams to standard therapy daily is no better than azathioprine or cyclosporine for improving organ rejection, kidney function, or survival in patients after kidney transplant (92828). All individual studies in these analyses used Bailing (Cs-C-Q80) fermented cordyceps mycelial product (95905, 92828).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral cordyceps is beneficial in patients with lung cancer on chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with lung cancer shows that taking cordyceps 0.5-6 grams daily for 21-42 days along with chemotherapy or radiation therapy improves tumor response rates and markers of immune function when compared with radiation or chemotherapy alone. Additionally, cordyceps appears to reduce the incidence of some treatment related adverse effects, such as radiation pneumonitis or chemotherapy-related myelosuppression. However, the analysis is limited by the low quality of included studies and a lack of data on overall survival or progression-free survival (116128).\nless\nRadiation-induced pneumonitis. It is unclear if oral cordyceps reduces the incidence of radiation-induced pneumonitis in patients with lung cancer on radiotherapy.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with lung cancer shows that taking cordyceps 0.5-6 grams daily for 21-42 days along with radiation therapy reduces the incidence of radiation pneumonitis compared with radiation alone (116128).\nless\nSexual dysfunction. It is unclear if oral cordyceps is beneficial in patients with sexual dysfunction.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific mycelial fermentation product of cordyceps (CordyMax Cs-4) approximately 3 grams daily for 40 days can improve symptoms of hyposexuality in 66% of patients, compared with 32% of patients taking natural cordyceps and 24% of patients taking placebo (46145).\nless\nTinnitus. Although there is interest in using oral cordyceps for tinnitus, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cordyceps for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate cordyceps for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCordyceps is a fungus. For commercial and most experimental purposes, the mycelial cells of cordyceps are propagated in a laboratory setting (512, 109706). Active constituents of cordyceps are polysaccharides, adenosine, cordycepin, cordycepic acid, and ergosterol. The constituents in the propagated mycelial cells are purportedly similar to that of the wild fungus (95905, 109706).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn humans, cordyceps has anti-inflammatory effects. Taking cordyceps seems to reduce levels of inflammatory factors such as C-reactive protein and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (111903, 116126).\nAnticancer effects\nStudies in animals with cancer suggest cordyceps improves immune response, reduces tumor size (3409, 3431, 3434), and lengthens survival time (3434, 3437). Some evidence suggests cordyceps might be cytotoxic to cancer cells (3410, 3416, 3420), particularly lung carcinoma (3407) and melanoma (3427).\nCardiovascular effects\nCordyceps shows evidence that it can inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombus formation (3429). Other studies suggest cordyceps polysaccharides might reduce plasma triglycerides and cholesterol (3415).\nEndocrine effects\nCordyceps polysaccharides show evidence that they might increase corticosterone production (3412). Other studies suggest they might reduce blood glucose (3415) without reducing plasma insulin levels (3415, 3421).\nImmunologic effects\nCordyceps has demonstrated the potential to both increase and suppress immunologic activity. Preliminary studies suggest cordyceps might stimulate immune function by increasing the number of T helper cells (3431); increasing the natural killer cell activity (3427); stimulating the blood mononuclear cells (3414); increasing the levels of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 (3414); and prolonging the survival of lymphocytes (3432). Preliminary animal studies suggest cordyceps could possibly be beneficial in treating systemic lupus erythematosus; results show that cordyceps might inhibit the production of anti-double strand DNA antibodies, which are a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (3424).\nMuscular effects\nIn humans research, supplementation with cordyceps before high-intensity exercise appears to accelerate muscle recovery by inducing the recruitment of CD34+ bone marrow stem cells to exercise-damaged muscle tissue and increasing the expansion of Pax7+ satellite cells, which are the main muscle stem cell type that aid in muscle regeneration and recovery (116125)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of coriander.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of coriander are the fruit (seed). Coriander is a rich source of vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron (19). The odor and taste of coriander are due to the volatile oil, which consists mainly of linalool (60-70%) (7).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that a lotion containing 0.5% coriander oil reduces ultraviolet-induced edema, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory effect (46206).\nAntibacterial effects\nEvidence from in vitro research suggests that coriander essential oil has antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (31330). However, other in vitro research suggests that aqueous extract of coriander does not inhibit the growth of bacteria isolated from oral cavities (33826).\nAnticancer effects\nSome preliminary research suggests that coriander essential oils may have anticancer effects. Evidence from in vitro research shows that coriander essential oils can prevent the formation of DNA adducts by aflatoxin B1 (39902). In theory, this effect may limit the hepatocarcinogenicity of aflatoxin B1. Other in vitro research shows that linalool, a constituent of coriander essential oil, can decrease the viability of human liver carcinoma cells. The anticancer effect was attributed to the antioxidant effects of linalool (46222).\nAntidiabetic effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that coriander fruit extract stimulates insulin secretion in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes by stimulating beta-cell activity (46153, 46216).\nAntifungal effects\nEvidence from in vitro research shows that coriander essential oil has antifungal activity against Geotrichum candidum, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Rhodotorula (31330, 46260). Other in vitro research shows that coriander essential oil can inhibit the growth and prevent the production of aflatoxin by Aspergillus parasiticus (46242). However, coriander essential oil does not appear to inhibit the growth or ochratoxin A production by Aspergillus ochraceus NRRL 3174 (46158).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that crude oil and oil fractions of coriander fruit have radical scavenging activity (36069). Other in vitro research suggests that linalool, a constituent of coriander essential oil, can scavenge superoxide anions (46243). However, some in vitro research suggests that linalool only modestly inhibits lipid peroxidation (46186). In vitro research suggests that aqueous extract of coriander fruit scavenges superoxide radicals and inhibits lipid peroxide (39778).\nAntiparasitic effects\nEvidence from in vitro research suggests that coriander essential oil has larvicidal activity against the seaside mosquito, Ochlerotatus caspius (31409).\nCardiovascular effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that coriander extract can lower blood pressure by inducing vasodilation and increasing diuresis (46205, 46221, 111130). One animal study suggests that coriander's diuretic effect may be due to downregulation of NHE3 expression, a transporter of sodium and hydrogen ions responsible for sodium absorption in the kidney and small intestine. Some researchers theorize that coriander's vasodilatory effects may be related to its antioxidant effects and ability to alter gut microbiota composition, which has been correlated with increases in serum markers associated with vasodilation, including prostaglandin I2, nitric oxide, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (111130).\nDermatologic effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that coriandrin, a constituent of coriander, induces photosensitization in mammalian cells. However, the effect is weaker than that of psoralen (46228).\nGastrointestinal effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that coriander extract stimulates gastric acid secretion and increases gut stimulation via a cholinergic mechanism (39864, 46221). Also, evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that coriander may stimulate digestion by increasing the activity of pancreatic enzymes, including lipase, amylase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin (46178, 46267). In theory, these effects may benefit patients with disorders resulting from delayed gastrointestinal transit, such as indigestion, constipation, or flatulence. On the other hand, evidence from other animal research suggests that coriander fruit extract has spasmolytic effects, which appears to be mediated through a Ca2+ antagonist mechanism (46221). In theory, this effect may benefit patients with hyperactive gut disorders, such as diarrhea.\nHypocholesterolemic effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that coriander fruit decreases total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in rats administered a high-fat diet. This effect was attributed to the ability of coriander fruit to increase lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity, hepatic bile acid synthesis, and cholesterol degradation (46211, 46247).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that coriander fruit extract has anxiolytic effects and may have sedative and muscle-relaxant effects based on an animal model of anxiety (46184)."

It has antioxidant activity due to its polyphenol, tannin, proanthocyanidin, and flavonoid content (18243).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCorn silk extracts have possible anti-inflammatory effects due to inhibition of tumor necrosis factor and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression (18243). In an animal model of diabetic nephropathy, corn silk polysaccharides reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and malondialdehyde (115864).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn various animal models, corn silk reduced blood glucose levels, improved insulin sensitivity, and reversed damage to pancreatic beta-cells (18243, 103365, 115864).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal research suggests that corn silk protects the liver against gamma radiation-induced oxidative injury and reduces oxidative stress associated with exhaustive exercise or nicotine exposure. The antioxidant effects of corn silk appear to differ depending on the location of the silk and the type of corn from which it is obtained. Also, exposure to air appears to increase the antioxidant activity of the silk (18243, 115862). In mice and in vitro, the antioxidant effects of corn silk extract were thought to play a role in its anti-photoaging effects (103361).\nDiuretic effects\nDiuretic effects, with increases in sodium and potassium excretion, have been reported in animals. In humans, evidence is conflicting, which might be related to the dose of corn silk used (18243, 93869).\nEnergy effects\nIn mice, corn silk increases exercise endurance and anti-fatigue activity, which is associated with elevated liver glycogen (18243).\nHepatic effects\nIn mice administered nicotine, corn silk extracts reduced alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase (115862).\nHypolipidemic effects\nIn various animal models, corn silk extract and polysaccharides reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels (18243, 103365, 115862, 115864).\nHypotensive effects\nIn clinical research, corn silk extract decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with and without hypertension (93869). The possible hypotensive effects of corn silk might be related to increased diuresis and electrolyte loss (93869). In addition, in an animal model, corn silk extract reduced systolic blood pressure, possibly by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). An ACE inhibitory peptide, CSBp5, was identified in the corn silk extract (103354).\nNeurological effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that polysaccharides in corn silk might have antidepressant activity. In laboratory research, corn silk inhibits cholinesterases, leading to speculation that it may have neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's Disease (18243).\nRenal effects\nThere is interest in using corn silk to prevent nephrolithiasis. Animal research in rats with chemically-induced urolithiasis shows that taking corn silk extract 200-400 mg/kg orally for 28 days modestly lowers serum urea and creatinine levels and reduces formation of calcium oxalate crystals when compared with control (112731)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of costus are the root and oil. Costus oil is obtained through distillation of the root(1516). There are at least 22 compounds in the essential oil, including linalool, L-alpha-terpineol, estragol, and various phenolic compounds with the most abundant being chlorogenic acid (115972, 116042).\n\nConstituents of costus include sesquiterpene lactones, with dehydrocostus lactone found in the highest amount. Other constituents are costunolide and related metabolites, alpha- and beta-costol, and germacrenes (73149, 73238, 73241, 100012, 115974). The root also contains anthraquinones, alkaloids, shikokiols, and flavonoids (100012, 115974). Costus root contains minerals including barium, calcium, potassium, sulfur, phosphorus, molybdenum, indium, antimony, praseodymium, and magnesium (116043).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCostus is traditionally used orally and topically for inflammatory conditions. In animal and in vitro models, costus and its constituents, including the sesquiterpene lactones, had anti-inflammatory effects. Constituents have been shown to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide and increase the levels of antioxidant biomarkers (73139, 73143, 73144, 73158, 73164, 73213, 73243, 100012, 115972).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn an animal model of diabetes, costus root extract regulates blood glucose metabolism by modulating enzymes involved in glycolysis (glucokinase) and gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase). These effects may be attributed to the high content of phenolic compounds, particularly chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acid A, which have demonstrated hypoglycemic properties (115972).\nAntilithiatic effects\nIn an animal model of urinary lithiasis, ethanolic costus extract reduces calcium oxalate crystal formation in the kidney compared with control. However, neither aqueous nor ethanolic extracts showed significant effects in reducing struvite crystal formation (116042).\nAntiprotozoal effects\nCostus is used for intestinal parasites. In vitro, costus inhibited the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. In animals, it prevented the growth and reproduction of Clonorchis sinensis (48723, 48724, 73178, 100012).\nGastrointestinal (GI) effects\nIn animal tissue models, costus extract both stimulates and inhibits GI motility, depending on the concentration (73212). In an animal model of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced severe intestinal mucositis, giving 1 or 3 grams/kg orally daily of a traditional Chinese herb mixture, Radix Aucklandiae Herbal Preparation (RAHP), for 7 days reduces mucositis, weight loss, and diarrhea. It also reduces the proinflammatory mediators, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, cyclo-oxygenase-2, and NF-kappa-beta. The mixture contains costus root, Malabar cardamom fruit, Pinellia ternata root, tangerine peel, Panax ginseng root, Atractylodes root, Poria mushroom, and licorice root (109908).\nHepatoprotective effects\nCostus is traditionally used for liver health. In animal research, costus extract had hepatoprotective effects, including improved liver histology and beneficial effects on levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (73213, 73164, 73258, 100012, 115972).\nImmune effects\nCostus is used for various infections. In vitro, constituents of costus had immune effects, including inhibition of the proliferation of T cells and killing function of cytotoxic T cells (73269, 73300). In an animal model of immunosuppression, costus extract given alone or conjugated with chitosan nanoparticles enhances immune response as shown by increased total leukocyte count, increased complement C3 and C4 levels, and reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels compared with controls. The immune-enhancing effects were greater when costus was conjugated with chitosan nanoparticles (116043).\nProstate effects\nIn an animal model of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), giving a costus extract 20 or 40 mg/kg orally once daily for 12 weeks reduces prostate weight and volume, prostate specific antigen levels, and prostate epithelial tissue thickness. The extract also reduces reactive oxygen species in BPH cells and reduces the levels of inflammatory markers including NF-kappa-B-p65 proteins, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1-beta, and IL-6, and increases cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression. It also decreases expression of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and increases expression of pro-apoptotic protein BAX, caspase-3, and caspase-9 (109907).\nThyroid effects\nIn animal research, costus root extract increases serum T3 and T4 levels and decreases thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in rats with induced hypothyroidism. Additionally, the extract normalizes thyroid gland histology. These effects appear to be mediated through regulation of several metabolic pathways disrupted in hypothyroidism, including polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism (115974)."

The time to full onset of action was 45.6 minutes and 34.6 minutes with cowhage 15 grams and 30 grams, respectively. Peak levodopa plasma concentrations were 110% higher and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was 165% larger with cowhage compared with levodopa/carbidopa 200/50 mg (12232).\n\nOther pharmacokinetic research suggests that higher doses of cowhage are required to achieve similar levodopa serum levels when compared with levodopa/carbidopa products containing equivalent levodopa content. This is likely due to the inclusion of the decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa, which inhibits peripheral metabolism of levodopa (94725, 94726).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of levodopa serum concentrations in patients taking cowhage ranged from 59-94 minutes in one pharmacokinetic study (12232).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of cowhage are the bean or seed and the hair on the bean pod (94723). Cowhage contains a significant amount of levodopa (L-dopa). The whole cowhage bean contains about 3% to 7% L-dopa (7205, 46334, 46336, 94723, 94724). The inner layer (endocarp) of the pericarp, which has also been studied in patients with Parkinson disease, usually contains the highest amount of L-dopa, about 5.3% (7020). Cowhage seeds or beans are also known for their high protein (20% to 29%), carbohydrate (50% to 61%), and mineral content (7205, 46334, 46337, 46341, 94723). The seeds also contain smaller amounts of ash, fiber, crude lipid, lysine, and trypsin (7205, 46334, 46336, 94723, 94724, 94726). However, due to the presence of phenolics, tannins, alkaloids, L-dopa, lectins, trypsin inhibitors, and protease inhibitors, cowhage seeds may have restricted nutritional value unless the seeds are properly processed (7205, 46337, 94723).\nAnthelminthic activity\nIn vitro, cowhage extracts have shown anthelminthic effects (18, 94723).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal studies show that cowhage might lower blood glucose levels (7221, 94723) and possibly slow the development of diabetic nephropathy (7220). Cowhage contains significant amounts of minerals, including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, manganese, zinc, and copper. Some researchers speculate that cowhage might exert its hypoglycemic effect due to trace element stimulation of insulin or possibly because of orally active insulin-like compounds in cowhage (7221). Animal research also shows that cowhage can ameliorate destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes, possibly through immunosuppressive effects (103866).\nAntimicrobial effects\nSome in vitro research shows that methanolic extracts of cowhage leaves have mild antimicrobial activity against some bacteria (94723).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that cowhage extracts may have antioxidant activity (94723, 100736).\nAntivenom activity\nThere is interest in using cowhage for snakebite. Cowhage extract seems to have a procoagulant effect against the venom of the saw scaled viper (Echis carinatus), when given at least 24 hours prior to laboratory exposure to the venom (7222).\nCounterirritant properties\nCowhage possesses counterirritant and rubefacient properties (18). The hairs (spicules) of the bean pod or seed cause severe itching, burning, and inflammation when they penetrate the epidermis (18, 6898). Serotonin and protein constituents such as mucunain are released into the skin, causing blood vessel dilation, redness, and inflammation (18, 6898). Repeated boiling of the bean is sometimes used to eliminate the pharmacologically and toxicologically active principles so that the bean can be consumed as food (7021, 7205).\nDopaminergic effects\nCowhage seeds contain 3% to 7% levodopa (7205, 46334, 46336, 94723, 94724). Clinical research shows that cowhage increases serum levodopa concentrations in Parkinson disease patients (12232, 94725, 94726).\nNeurologic effects\nCowhage seeds contain 3% to 7% levodopa (7205, 46334, 46336, 94723, 94724). Clinical research shows that cowhage increases serum levodopa concentrations in Parkinson disease patients (12232, 94725, 94726). There is also some speculation that cowhage might be beneficial in Parkinson disease via other mechanisms as well. In vitro research shows that cowhage extract has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on mouse microglial cells, which suggests possible neuroprotective effects in Parkinson disease (100736).\nProlactin secretion inhibition effects\nThere is interest in using cowhage to treat or prevent hyperprolactinemia. Low-quality clinical research shows that taking cowhage seed 15 grams orally once before receiving chlorpromazine injections attenuates serum prolactin elevations when compared with no treatment (7207). However very preliminary, low-quality, clinical research shows that taking cowhage seed 15 grams orally daily for 10-24 weeks does not improve prolactin levels in patients with primary hyperprolactinemia (7206).\nReproductive effects\nAnimal research in rats under chronic stress shows that taking cowhage seed extract 150-300 mg/kg orally once daily for 80 days improves sperm viability, but not testosterone levels, when compared with control (109514). However, other animal research shows that rats consuming a diet containing cowhage 2.25 grams daily for 8 weeks had significantly lower sperm count and motility when compared with a control diet (103865)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Cranberry products may possibly reduce the risk of repeat, symptomatic UTI in females with recurrent UTI, in children, and in people susceptible to UTI following kidney transplant, urogenital surgery, or radiation therapy near the urogenital system. While some positive evidence exists, most research suggests that cranberry products do not seem to reduce the risk of UTI in older adults in institutions, pregnant patients, or adults with neuromuscular dysfunction of the bladder.Cranberry is not recommended for the treatment of UTI in any population.\nCranberry appears to reduce the risk of UTI in some populations but not others. In healthy females at an increased risk of UTI or history of recurrent UTI, meta-analyses of clinical trials show that cranberry products decrease the overall risk of recurrent or first-time UTI by 26% to 35% (46473, 92578, 96739, 116190). In 2019, the American Urological Association published guidelines stating that, based on low certainty evidence, clinicians may offer cranberry tablets or juice as prophylaxis for females with recurrent UTIs. Due to a lack of compelling evidence for any specific product, the guidelines recommend choosing formulations based on availability and tolerability (100855). In 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved qualified health claims stating that consuming cranberry juice in doses of at least 8 ounces daily, or cranberry supplements in doses of at least 500 mg daily, may help reduce the risk of recurrent UTI in healthy females. However, the FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence to support these claims (103302).\n\nThe benefits of cranberry for prevention of UTI during pregnancy are unclear. Subgroup analysis of meta-analyses suggest that cranberry supplementation does not reduce the risk of UTI in pregnant adults compared with placebo or no treatment (100855, 116190). A preliminary clinical study shows that drinking cranberry juice 240 mL three times daily until delivery does not reduce the frequency of asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomatic UTI during pregnancy, although the study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes (16415). In contrast, one preliminary clinical trial shows that UTI frequency was reduced in 70.5% of those ingesting cranberry juice 250 mL four times daily, compared with only 32% of those taking placebo (93670).\n\nIn children, a meta-analysis shows that taking cranberry products probably reduces the risk of subsequent symptomatic UTIs by up to 54% compared with placebo or no treatment, but does not specify a particular formulation (116190). Clinical trials show that daily consumption of cranberry syrup (Pharmatoka), cranberry juice (Cranberry UR-50, Kikkoman Company) 100 mL, cranberry-lingonberry juice 50 mL, and cranberry extract (Anthocran) 120 mg reduce the risk of UTI recurrence in children (46452, 96733, 96737, 108055). In contrast, another clinical trial shows that drinking cranberry juice (Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc) 5 mL/kg daily for 6 months does not reduce the incidence of recurrent UTI when compared with placebo, although it does decrease the total number of UTI episodes and length of antimicrobial therapy per child (46470).\n\nIn older, institutionalized adults, a meta-analysis of 3 studies evaluating the effectiveness of cranberry products shows no benefit in preventing symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs (116190). A clinical study in females residing in long-term care (LTC) facilities shows that taking a specific cranberry supplement (Ellura, Pharmatoka) once daily for 1 year does not reduce the incidence of UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria (92517). However, clinical trials of cranberry products in elderly patients in LTC facilities suggest that cranberry may be more effective in patients at a higher risk for UTIs, such as those with diabetes, long-term catheterization, or recurrent UTIs (90041, 108055), and in patients with E. coli-related UTIs (46389, 46472). In one small study, providing all patients living in a LTC facility with 4 ounces of cranberry juice or six tablets of a specific concentrated cranberry product (Azo-Cranberry, i-Health, Inc.) daily for 13 months decreased the facility's overall monthly UTI rate from 27.7 to 20.7 (46492). In another clinical trial, taking cranberry juice cocktail (Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc) 300 mL daily for 6 months decreased the rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria plus pyuria by 13% in older females living in institutional settings (7008). In another clinical trial, taking a cranberry capsule 500 mg, standardized to 1.8% PACs, twice daily for 12 months decreased the risk of UTI by around 26% in patients at high-risk for UTI, including those with catheters, diabetes, or at least one UTI in the previous 12 months (90041).\n\nMeta-analyses and clinical research show that cranberry products do not reduce the risk of UTI associated with neurogenic bladder, neuromuscular dysfunction, or insufficient bladder emptying in adults or children (2811, 6759, 11980, 46379, 46425, 46473, 90044, 92578, 96737, 108055, 116190). However, one study found benefit in patients with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury taking cranberry capsules (Cran-Max, Proprietary Nutritionals, Inc.) 500 mg daily (46443).\n\nCranberry products have also been evaluated in a variety of other high-risk populations, with mixed results. A meta-analysis of 6 studies shows that cranberry products reduce the risk of UTIs in people with increased susceptibility to UTI due to an intervention (e.g., kidney transplant, radiotherapy to urogenital system, or urogenital surgery) when compared with placebo (116190). Cranberry extracts do not seem to reduce the risk of UTIs in individuals undergoing hysterectomy and/or anterior vaginal repair (46465), pelvic floor surgery (104245), or in patients with multiple sclerosis (46496, 116190). Taking cranberry powder capsules (NurtiCran90, Petefa AB) 550 mg three times daily for 5 days does not reduce the UTI rate at days 5 or 14 when compared with placebo in postoperative females with hip fracture receiving a urinary catheter; however, the study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in this outcome (96734). Other preliminary clinical research in elderly males with benign prostatic hyperplasia and a recent UTI shows that taking a standardized cranberry extract (Anthocran) 120 mg daily for 60 days reduces the UTI recurrence rate by about 62% when compared with placebo (96735).\n\nCranberry supplements have been studied in a variety of formulations, but it is unclear whether certain cranberry formulations are better than others (116190). Most positive studies utilized oral cranberry EXTRACTS in tablet, powder, or capsule form (6760, 17210, 46366, 46432, 93669, 116190). Some products (Cranberry Supreme, GNC; Cranpac, IPCA Laboratories), taken as 200 mg twice daily, were standardized to provide 100-120 mg of proanthocyanidins (PACs) daily (46432). Some of these studies used capsules containing 400 mg cranberry solids twice daily (6760) or Natural Cranberry Extract (Solgar Vitamin and Herb Co.) 800 mg twice daily (17210). However, a clinical study in healthy females with a history of UTIs shows that taking a specific cranberry extract product (Urophenol; Diana Food) does not reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI when taken at a dose of 120 mg twice daily, standardized to 15% PACs, or at a dose of 1 mg twice daily, standardized to 1% PACs. A subgroup analysis suggests that the high dose may have modest benefit in those with less than 5 UTIs a year (108054).\n\nCranberry JUICE or syrup has yielded mixed results for the prevention of UTI in patients with a history of recurrent UTIs, with some showing significant benefit (8253, 46366, 96736, 116190). These studies used cranberry juice 240-250 mL 1-3 times daily (46366, 96736), cranberry syrup, or a combination beverage containing cranberry juice plus lingonberry juice (Maija) 50 mL daily (8253). A meta-analysis in adults, predominantly women, shows that taking cranberry juice, but not cranberry tablets, reduces the risk of UTI when compared with placebo (116197). However, other studies found no significant improvement when cranberry juice is compared with placebo (17524, 46471, 90047), although some of these studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference (17524, 46471).\n\nCranberry products have also been compared with other treatments including antibiotics and probiotics for preventing recurrent UTI, but the results are unclear. A meta-analysis suggests that cranberry products reduce the risk of symptomatic UTIs compared to probiotics. The analysis also showed no difference in the risk of UTI between cranberry products and antibiotics, but the precision of included studies was poor (116190). In one study, taking cranberry extract capsules (Cran-Max; Proprietary Nutritionals, Inc) 500 mg daily for 6 months was as effective as trimethoprim 100 mg daily in elderly females with recurrent UTI (16720). However, taking this same cranberry product twice daily for 12 months was less effective than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 480 mg once daily in younger premenopausal individuals (17176). Additional research in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) shows that daily consumption of cranberry products results in UTI recurrence rates equivalent to those obtained with prophylactic antibiotics. Cranberry juice (Cranberry UR-50, Kikkoman Company) 100 mL daily was equally effective to cefaclor 5-10 mg/kg daily; cranberry syrup (Pharmatoka) 0.2 mL/kg daily was equally effective to trimethoprim 0.2 mL/kg daily (96737).\n\nAlthough there is interest in cranberry as a treatment for UTI, a Cochrane systematic review concluded that there is no good quality evidence to suggest that cranberry is effective for treatment of UTI, and data are needed regarding its impact on clinically important outcomes including reduction in symptoms, sterilization of the urine, and side effects (116144). While taking cranberry is not recommended as a treatment for UTIs, its effects on well-being have been evaluated. In a single-center clinical study in adults with symptoms of UTI and elevated leukocyte counts, taking a specific cranberry supplement (Ocean Cranberry, Orzax) containing 36 mg of proanthocyanidin daily for 7 days improves patient-reported well-being when compared with fosfomycin, based on general descriptors (e.g., bad, well, very well) (116192). Clinical significance is unclear, as the study did not assess improvement or resolution of UTI symptoms or infection.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline. Oral cranberry may be beneficial for improving visual episodic memory in healthy, elderly adults, but its effects on other aspects of cognition are unclear.\nA clinical study in healthy adults aged 50-80 years shows that taking a freeze-dried cranberry powder 4.5 grams twice daily (standardized to provide 281 mg proanthocyanidins daily), provided as a sachet and added to food or beverage for 12 weeks, improves visual episodic memory performance during a memory and recall test (Rey Complex Figure Test), but does not appear to affect other measures such as attention, orientation, fluency, language, processing speed, or short-term memory, when compared with placebo (108564). Cranberry supplementation also does not appear to affect grey matter structure; however, due to the low number of patients who completed a baseline and follow-up MRI, this study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Preliminary clinical research suggests that oral cranberry is beneficial for reducing BPH symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking powdered dried cranberry fruit 500 mg three times daily for 6 months improves lower urinary symptoms and reduces prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels when compared with no treatment in patients 45 years of age or older with elevated PSA levels, a negative prostate biopsy, and clinically confirmed non-bacterial prostatitis (17126). Another small study in those 45 years of age and older without elevated PSA levels shows that taking a specific dried cranberry powder (Flowens, Naturex-DBS, LLC) 250-500 mg daily for 6 months reduces lower urinary tract symptoms and improves voiding and storage symptoms when compared with placebo (96738).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral cranberry for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cranberry for this condition.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Although some research suggests that oral cranberry may modestly improve some CVD risk factors, it is unclear if it is beneficial for CVD prevention.\nA meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies shows that cranberry juice or cranberry extract seems to reduce systolic blood pressure by 3.6 mmHg and body mass index by 0.3 kg/m2 when compared with placebo. However, cranberry does not appear to improve diastolic blood pressure, lipid levels, glycemic control, or waist circumference (102849). Furthermore, two additional meta-analyses of lower-to moderate-quality clinical studies, including several newer studies, show that taking cranberry juice, cranberry extract, or cranberry powder daily for 1-6 months does not reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure, lipid parameters, or glycemic parameters when compared with placebo (116193, 116194). Overall, the generalizability of these results is limited, due to heterogeneity of the study populations which included healthy adults and those with a variety of cardiometabolic disorders (coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, etc).\nless\nCatheter-related infections. Although there has been interest in using oral cranberry for catheter-related infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cranberry for this condition.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral cranberry for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cranberry for this condition.\nDental caries. Oral cranberry extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children 3-6 years of age with dental caries shows that taking a combination supplement with cranberry extract formulated to 40% proanthocyanidins and Ligilactobacillus salivarius CECT5713 twice daily for 3 months reduces the incidence of new initial lesions, but not moderate or extensive lesions, after 9 months when compared with placebo. (116196). The use of a per-protocol analysis in this study may overestimate the effects. Furthermore, it is unclear if this effect is due to cranberry, Ligilactobacillus salivarius, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for diabetes.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking cranberry supplements orally does not improve fasting serum glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), fructosamine, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (11328).\n\nAdditionally, a meta-analysis of lower-to moderate-quality clinical studies shows that taking cranberry juice 240 -750 mL, cranberry extract capsules 144-1500 mg, or cranberry powder 9 grams daily for 1-6 months does not reduce fasting serum glucose or HbA1C when compared with placebo (16194). Overall, the generalizability of these results is limited, due to heterogeneity of the study populations which included healthy adults and those with a variety of cardiometabolic disorders (coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, etc).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. There is conflicting evidence regarding the use of oral cranberry for Helicobacter pylori eradication, either as a standalone treatment or in combination with standard triple therapy.\nTwo small clinical studies show that taking cranberry juice 480-500 mL, containing 88 mg proanthocyanidins (PACs), daily in two divided doses for 2-3 months can modestly increase the H. pylori eradication rate at 8 weeks, but not at 2 weeks, when compared with placebo. However, the eradication rate was only 20% or less, which is much lower than that obtained with conventional triple therapy (46388, 104248). Lower doses, as either cranberry juice or cranberry powder, do not seem to improve H. pylori eradication rates. Cranberry juice containing only 23 mg or 44 mg PACs or cranberry powder containing 36 mg or 72 mg PACs did not demonstrate benefit when compared with placebo (104248). Cranberry juice has also been studied in combination with standard triple therapy. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking cranberry juice 250 mL daily for 3 weeks along with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for one week does not increase the eradication rate when compared with triple therapy plus placebo. However, the combination treatment increased the rate of H. pylori eradication when only females were considered (46439). A meta-analysis of 4 small clinical studies, including three studies already discussed, shows that taking cranberry, either as a juice or a dried powder, does not improve H. pylori eradication rate when compared with placebo, regardless of treatment duration (108060). The validity of these findings is limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and incomplete reporting.\n\nIn asymptomatic children aged 6-16 years old with H. pylori, one clinical study shows that drinking cranberry juice 200 mL, with live or heat-killed Lactobacillus johnsonii 80 mL, daily for 3 weeks eradicates H. pylori in 15% to 22% of patients, compared with 1.5% of those receiving placebo. However, these rates are lower than those typically obtained with conventional triple therapy (46441).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of lower-to moderate-quality clinical studies shows that taking cranberry juice 240-750 mL, cranberry extract capsules 144-1500 mg, or cranberry powder 9 grams daily does not improve total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (16194). Overall, the generalizability of these results is limited, due to heterogeneity of the study populations which included healthy adults and those with a variety of cardiometabolic disorders (coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, etc).\n\nDrinking a combination of cranberry, blueberry, apple, and chokeberry juice 300 mL daily for 6 weeks appears to decrease total cholesterol and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared to baseline in females with overweight or obesity and at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease (111233). However, the validity of the study is limited by its small size, short duration, and lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if these effects are due to cranberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies shows that cranberry juice or cranberry extract seems to reduce systolic blood pressure by 3.6 mmHg, but not diastolic blood pressure, when compared with placebo (102849). However, two additional meta-analyses of lower-to moderate-quality clinical studies, including several newer studies, show that taking cranberry juice 240-750 mL or cranberry extract capsules 144-1500 mg for 1-6 months does not reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (116193, 116194). Overall, the generalizability of these results is limited, due to heterogeneity of the study populations which included healthy adults and those with a variety of cardiometabolic disorders (coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, etc).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for reducing the risk of kidney stones.\nAlthough some preliminary clinical research shows that drinking cranberry juice 500 mL diluted in 1500 mL water daily for 2 weeks can decrease urinary excretion of oxalate in healthy males, which suggests a decreased risk of kidney stone formation (46371), other preliminary clinical research shows that both cranberry juice and concentrated cranberry extracts can increase urinary oxalate levels, suggesting an increased risk of stone formation (7074, 46393).\nless\nMemory. It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for memory.\nPreliminary clinical research in cognitively intact older adults shows that taking cranberry juice 16 ounces twice daily for 6 weeks does not improve memory when compared with placebo (46390).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that drinking cranberry juice 240 mL twice daily for 8 weeks can increase plasma antioxidant capacity when compared with placebo in adults with metabolic syndrome. However, cranberry juice does not appear to affect blood pressure, blood glucose, serum lipids, or markers of inflammation when compared with placebo in these patients (46467).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for NAFLD.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with NAFLD shows that adding cranberry extract 288 mg daily to a weight loss diet for 12 weeks does not appear to affect body weight, liver enzymes, lipid levels, or steatosis grade when compared with placebo. Cranberry extract may moderately reduce insulin levels and insulin resistance (104249). However, the clinical impact of these reductions is unclear. Another clinical trial in adults with NAFLD shows that taking dried cranberry powder 144 mg daily after lunch for 6 months improves steatosis grade as measured by ultrasound, insulin sensitivity, and levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, but does not affect liver enzyme levels, when compared with placebo. All patients also consumed a reduced-calorie diet and an undefined dose of supplemental vitamin E (108058).\nless\nObesity. Oral cranberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in females with overweight or obesity and at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease shows that drinking a combination of cranberry, blueberry, apple, and chokeberry juice 300 mL daily for 6 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), or blood pressure but might improve total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared to baseline (111233). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the small study size, short duration, and lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if these effects are due to cranberry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOveractive bladder. It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for overactive bladder.\nPreliminary clinical research in otherwise healthy females shows that taking dried cranberry powder 500 mg daily for 24 weeks can reduce daily micturition by 16% and urgency episodes by 57% when compared with placebo. Patients taking cranberry powder also reported an improvement in their own perception of their bladder condition when compared with placebo (104246). Limitations of this study include a short duration, lack of a run-in period, and high drop-out rate, which interfered with the ability to meet power.\nless\nPeriodontitis. Topical and oral cranberry extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with chronic periodontitis shows that applying a topical combination gel product containing cranberry extract 2.5 grams and garcinia extract after scaling and root planing reduces plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and salivary biomarkers of periodontal disease when compared with scaling and root planing alone and similarly to scaling and root planing with tetracycline fibers (112272). It is unclear if these effects are due to cranberry, garcinia, or the combination.\n\nHowever, a small clinical study in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a supplement containing cranberry extract 340 mg, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, grapeseed extract, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not reduce periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation, among others, when compared with placebo (111708). It is unclear if these effects are due to cranberry extract, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPeristomal lesions. Although there has been interest in using oral cranberry for peristomal lesions, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of cranberry for this condition.\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if cranberry is beneficial for preventing prostate cancer recurrence.\nClinical research shows that taking cranberry powder (Pacran, Naturex) 1500 mg for a mean of 30 days prior to radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer does not improve prostate tissue markers when compared with taking placebo. However, levels of prostate tissue antigen decreased by approximately 22% when compared with baseline (105127).\nless\nRadiation-induced cystitis. Evidence for the use of cranberry juice in the prevention of radiation-induced cystitis is conflicting.\nOne small clinical study in individuals with prostate cancer shows that taking 200 mg of a cranberry extract standardized to 30% proanthocyanidins (Monoselect Macrocarpon; PharmExtracta) once daily during external beam radiotherapy for 6-7 weeks reduces the risk of lower UTI by 64% when compared with placebo (92579). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking cranberry capsules, standardized to contain a total of 72 mg proanthocyanidins, daily during radiation treatment for prostate cancer and for two weeks post-treatment, does not improve pain, burning, nocturia, or urinary flow symptoms from radiation-induced cystitis when compared with a beetroot placebo (104247). Additionally, preliminary clinical research in patients receiving radiotherapy for bladder or cervical cancer shows that consuming cranberry juice 250 mL daily for 2 weeks does not seem to reduce the incidence of UTIs (46469).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial in RA.\nA clinical study in adults with RA shows that drinking reduced-calorie cranberry juice 250 mL twice daily in addition to taking fish oil 1 gram three times daily for 90 days improves disease activity score (DAS28-CRP) when compared with no supplementation. However, this combination was similarly effective to patients taking fish oil alone, suggesting that any benefits may be due to fish oil, as opposed to cranberry juice (108057). In contrast, another small study in adults with RA shows that drinking reduced-calorie cranberry juice 500 mL daily for 90 days does not improve disease activity score or clinically relevant biologic markers of RA such as rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein when compared with a control group (112273).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of URTIs.\nClinical research shows that drinking a cranberry juice beverage 450 mL daily for 70 days does not decrease the incidence of cold or flu, but may reduce cold and flu symptoms, when compared with placebo in healthy adults (90046).\nless\nUrinary odor. It is unclear if oral cranberry is beneficial for urinary odor.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that cranberry juice cocktail might reduce urinary odors when given orally on a regular basis to patients with urinary incontinence (3333, 3334, 8254). Cranberry juice cocktail up to 237 mL three times daily for up to 4 weeks has been used (3334).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate cranberry for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nCranberry dried powder is typically used in doses of 250-1500 mg daily for up to 6 months. Cranberry extract is typically used in doses of 120-1600 mg daily for up to 12 weeks. Cranberry juice beverage is typically used in doses of 120-750 mL daily for up to 90 days. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nCranberry preparations are sometimes standardized to proanthocyanidin (PAC) content. Cranberry products containing PAC levels of 36-72 mg are most often taken in divided doses (i.e., twice daily) (46432, 90041, 92517, 92579, 116190).\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nSome cranberry preparations are standardized to 11-12% quinic acid per dose. Others are standardized to 30% phenolics (46432). Other cranberry products are standardized by proanthocyanidin content with ranges of 9-36 mg per 500 mg capsule (90041, 92517) or 50-60 mg per 200 mg tablet or capsule (46432, 92579). Dried cranberry contains the highest amount of polyphenols on a fresh weight basis compared to frozen cranberries, cranberry sauce, and jellied sauce (46445). However, based on serving size, frozen cranberries contain the most polyphenols, followed by 100% juice, dried cranberries, 27% juice, sauce, and jellied sauce.\n\nSome dried cranberry fruit powder has been standardized to contain 0.11% anthocyanins, 1.95% condensed tannins, 3.49% phenolics (total), 14.85% organic acids, and 15.5% sugars (17126).\n\nSome cranberry juice beverages have been standardized to contain proanthocyanidins (PACs) 65% to 75%, anthocyanins 6.8% to 11.3%, organic acids 0.5% to 0.9%, phenolic acids, 7.1% to 7.5%, and flavonols 6.8% to 10.0% on a dry weight basis (90046). Other cranberry beverages have been standardized to contain 54% cranberry juice containing total polyphenols 835 mg and anthocyanins 94 mg (46466). Some cranberry juice cocktails have been standardized to contain PACs up to 112 mg per 8 ounces (16415, 17524, 46471, 104248). Other cranberry juice beverages have been standardized to contain 40 mg PACs per 125 mL (90047).",

However, clinical research shows that cranberry juice does not significantly affect the levels, metabolism, or elimination of the CYP2C9 substrates flurbiprofen or diclofenac (11094, 90048). Also, in patients stabilized on warfarin, drinking cranberry juice 250 mL daily for 7 days does not significantly increase the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate (15374). Additional pharmacokinetic research shows that cranberry juice does not increase peak plasma concentrations or area under the concentration-time curve of warfarin (15393).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, cranberry might increase the levels and adverse effects of CYP3A4 substrates.\nA case of upper back pain, rhabdomyolysis, and abnormal liver function has been reported for a patient taking atorvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate, in combination with cranberry juice 16 ounces daily for 2 weeks.

However, research is conflicting.\nThere is contradictory evidence about the effect of cranberry juice on warfarin. Case reports have linked cranberry juice consumption to increases in the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients taking warfarin, resulting in severe spontaneous bleeding and excessive postoperative bleeding (10452, 12189, 12668, 21187, 21188, 21189, 46378, 46396, 46411)(46415, 90043). Daily consumption of cranberry sauce for one week has also been linked to an increase in INR in one case report (16816). In a small study in healthy young males, taking a high dose of 3 grams of cranberry juice concentrate capsules, equivalent to 57 grams of fruit daily, for 2 weeks produced a 30% increase in the area under the INR-time curve after a single 25-mg dose of warfarin (16416). However, 3 very small clinical studies in patients stabilized on warfarin reported that cranberry juice 250 mL once or twice daily for 7 days (27% cranberry juice or pure cranberry juice) or 240 mL once daily for 14 days does not significantly increase INR or affect plasma warfarin levels (15374, 17124, 90045). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear. It is possible that the form and dose of cranberry may play a role, as cranberry extracts and juices contain different constituents. Additionally, an in vitro study evaluating 5 different cranberry juices found varying effects, with only a cranberry concentrate, and not diluted cranberry juices, inhibiting CYP2C9. However, this concentrate did not inhibit CYP2C9 activity in humans (108062).\nless",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with cranberry.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter intake of cranberry juice, plasma phenol levels peaked at 1 hour, and vitamin C concentrations reached a plateau at 2 hours (6754). Maximum levels of anthocyanins in plasma occurred between one to three hours after cranberry juice ingestion. In the plasma, concentrations of anthocyanins were between 0.56 and 4.64 nmol/L (46454). After ingesting cranberry powder 4.5 grams twice daily for 12 weeks, a total of 13 metabolites were identified and quantified in the plasma. These belong to several phenolic classes including flavonols, phenyl-gamma-valerolactones, cinnamic acids, phenylpropanoic acids, phenylacetic acids, benzoic acids, benzaldehydes, hippuric acids, and catechols in concentrations ranging from 10-90 nmol/L (112274).\nExcretion\nHealthy volunteers who ingested 200 mL of cranberry juice excreted 6 of 12 anthocyanins identified in cranberry in their urine at 24 hours, although the maximum anthocyanin excretion occurred between 3 and 6 hours after ingestion (46419). Another study in healthy individuals shows that after ingesting cranberry powder 4.5 grams twice daily for 12 weeks a total of 67 metabolites were identified and quantified in the urine, the most abundant of which were hippuric acid derivatives, phenyl-gamma-valerolactones, and phenylacetic acids. After cranberry treatment, urinary concentration was higher in the cranberry group for 5 metabolites, but not total metabolites, when compared with placebo. Further investigation suggests that there is individual variation in phenolic metabolism, with colonic metabolism being the most prevalent (112274).\n\nIn humans, intake of 480 mL cranberry juice resulted in a urinary recovery of 0.79 ± 0.90% of the dose of anthocyanins (46454). After dried cranberry juice ingestion, compounds excreted in urine included hippuric acid (7.01-42.82 mg/mmol of creatinine), hydroxybenzoic acid-glycine conjugate isomers (salicyluric acid, 2-12.53 mg/mmol of creatinine), quercetin glucuronide (0.96-5.25 mg/mmol of creatinine), and dihydroxybenzoic acid isomers (0-0.76 mg/mmol of creatinine) (46437).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of the cranberry plant is the fruit. The cranberry fruit contains nearly 90% water (17100). The primary active constituents of cranberry are proanthocyanidins. Cranberry also contains anthocyanidins; ellagitannins; flavonols such as quercetin and kaempferol; catechins; and quinic, malic and citric acids. Other constituents include ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, chlorogenic acid, glutathione, glucose, fructose, and alpha-tocopherol (13532, 17100, 116190).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCranberry, as well as many other fruits and vegetables, contains significant amounts of salicylic acid. Salicylic acid, the active metabolite of aspirin, has anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, and antitumor effects. Cranberry juice contains about 7 mg of salicylic acid per liter. Drinking three 250 mL servings of cranberry juice daily for two weeks increases serum salicylate levels. It also increases excretion of salicylic and salicyluric acids (a salicylic acid metabolite) in the urine (12669, 12670, 12879). Cranberry has shown some anti-inflammatory activities, including the inhibition of cyclooxygenases (46428). In addition, a cranberry fraction has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by lipopolysaccharides in vitro (46406).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that the proanthocyanidin fraction of cranberry might have anticarcinogenic activity (888). Cranberry phytochemicals may induce apoptosis in tumor cells (36744, 46402, 46413, 46423, 46427, 46428, 46438). Proanthocyanidin oligomers, flavonols, and anthocyanin glycosides and triterpenoids are all likely contributors to the observed anticancer properties and may act in an additive fashion to block carcinogenesis (46444).\nAntidiabetic effects\nCranberry intake may affect insulin sensitivity. Preliminary clinical research in adults with insulin resistance shows that consumption of a specific strawberry and cranberry extract mixture (GlucoPhenol, NutraCanada) containing 330 mg of polyphenols daily for 6 weeks modestly increases insulin sensitivity compared to placebo. Patients taking the combination product did not experience a rise in C-peptide levels, indicating that the product may have inhibited additional insulin secretion. Blood levels of glucose, insulin, cholesterol, inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress markers remained unchanged (96732).\nAntifungal effects\nLaboratory studies suggest that 40% cranberry juice may inhibit the growth of some fungi (46478).\nAntioxidant effects\nEarly evidence shows that cranberry juice might increase the antioxidant capacity of plasma (6754). Cranberry and its constituents, particularly proanthocyanidins and quercetin, have shown antioxidant activity (19495, 36752, 46385, 46391, 46413, 46423, 46438, 46445).\nAntiviral effects\nCranberry may reduce the number of cold and flu symptoms perhaps because cranberry constituents dose-dependently inhibit infectivity of influenza virus A and B (46387).\nDental effects\nClinical data in children with dental caries show that rinsing with a mouth wash containing cranberry extract daily reduces counts of streptococcus mutans, one of the primary bacteria associated with development of dental caries, when compared to baseline (116195).\nGastrointestinal effects\nCranberry phenolics may have antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Cranberry may prevent adhesion of H. pylori in the stomach and reduce the chance of the associated gastrointestinal problems (6690, 46401).\n\nThere is interest in using cranberry to attenuate the production of toxins produced by gastrointestinal microbiota. A small clinical study in patients with chronic kidney disease shows that taking dry cranberry extract 500 mg (containing 36 mg proanthocyanidins) twice daily after lunch and dinner for 2 months, along with following a low-protein diet, does not reduce levels of lipopolysaccharides or uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, and indole-3 acetic acid, when compared with placebo (108061).\nGenitourinary effects\nFor many years, it was believed that cranberry prevented urinary tract infections (UTI) by means of urinary acidification by hippuric acid. However, although cranberry is acidic, it does not acidify the urine as previously thought. Rather, cranberries contain proanthocyanidins (PACs), also known as condensed tannins (2812, 2813, 2814, 3335, 3337, 3339, 6753, 6755, 6757, 102848)(116190). PACs seem to wrap around Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is the cause of most UTIs, and interfere with bacterial adherence to the urinary tract epithelial cells lining the bladder wall (3333, 3338, 6690, 17100, 46361, 46365, 46384, 46386, 46455)(46460, 46475). Without adhesion, E. coli cannot infect the urinary tract mucosal surface (116190). It probably also has this effect against other urinary tract pathogens (2815). Cranberry, however, does not seem to have the ability to release bacteria which are already adhered to the urinary tract epithelial cells (8252).\n\nThe specific cranberry formulation may alter the genitourinary effects of PACs. One study shows that PACs obtained from the whole cranberry fruit are less soluble than those obtained from cranberry juice. Additionally, in vitro evaluation of the urine of healthy volunteers who consumed these products for 1 week shows that the PACs with higher solubility (from cranberry juice) had greater anti-adhesion activity against E. coli than those with lower solubility (from whole cranberry fruit). This may explain some of the conflicting findings in clinical research, although prospective clinical studies comparing different sources of PACs are needed to confirm this hypothesis (105406). Also, cranberry does not seem to release bacteria which are already adhered to the urinary tract epithelial cells (8252).\n\nLaboratory evidence suggests that fructose in cranberries might also contribute to the anti-infective activity (2813, 3333, 6757, 17100). Cranberry juice has also shown antibacterial activity in culture medium against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis (3333, 3338, 6753). Whether urinary concentrations of the active constituents reach bactericidal levels is currently a topic of research (6753). Also, some conflicting evidence suggests that cranberry juice does not have bacteriostatic activity against strains of bacteria such as E. coli (46395).\n\nA study examining the effect of drinking cranberry-lingonberry juice on gut and urinary microbiomes in children sought to elucidate the mechanism of preventing UTI. The study found that while the diversity of urinary and gut microbiomes did not change, children drinking the cranberry-lingonberry juice had a different urinary and gut microbiome when compared with placebo. Specifically, the cranberry-lingonberry group had greater Firmicutes and fewer Proteobacteria urinary concentrations and greater Actinobacteria in the gut microbiome. This suggests that the mechanism by which cranberry-lingonberry juice prevents UTI in children is related to changes in urinary and gut microbiomes (111409).\nMetabolic effects\nDrinking a polyphenol-rich drink containing a combination of cranberry, chokeberry, and pomegranate for 8 weeks reduced fat and protein intake, resulting in reduced energy intake compared with an isocaloric drink. The combination drink also increased free fat mass and prevented body weight and triglyceride increases when compared with the isocaloric drink. Researchers also found that the combination drink inhibits phosphodiesterase activity, which stimulates lipolysis and therefore modulates body weight and composition (111411).\nPeriodontal disease prevention\nPreliminary data suggest that a high molecular weight cranberry constituent might prevent adhesion of plaque bacteria that cause periodontal disease (2816). In addition, some laboratory evidence suggests that cranberry proanthocyanidins and flavonols inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans (46408). Other laboratory and clinical research suggests that cranberry's ability to reduce Streptococci mutans adhesion is due to the activity of a high-molecular weight compound from cranberry that has not yet been identified (46373, 46375). A laboratory study found that cranberry constituents may reduce the capacity of Porphyromonas gingivalis to colonize periodontal sites (46414). Two in vitro studies found that cranberry fractions dose-dependently inhibited matrix metalloproteinases and intracellular signaling proteins produced by fibroblasts and macrophages associated with periodontal diseases (46434, 46433)."

It is also found in the diet, most often in red meat and seafood. Ninety-five percent of creatine is stored in skeletal muscle, with the remainder stored mostly in the brain and cardiac muscle (90328, 90330, 104668).",
            "Warnings": "In the U.S., a majority of sports nutrition supplements contain creatine (90332). Creatine supplementation is not included on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) list of prohibited substances and is allowed by the International Olympic Committee and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) (93623, 93624, 93625). However, the NCAA no longer allows colleges and universities to supply creatine to their students with school funds. Students are permitted to buy creatine on their own, and the NCAA has no plans to ban creatine unless sufficient medical evidence indicates that it is harmful (94603).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Creatine supplementation appears to be safe when used at loading doses of up to 25 grams daily or 0.3 grams/kg daily for up to 14 days in healthy adults (1367, 2100, 2101, 3996, 4569, 10064, 15354, 15520, 46570, 46587)(46673, 46688, 46719, 46753, 46801, 103278, 103279, 108336). Creatine supplementation also appears to be safe when used at maintenance doses of 4-5 grams daily for up to 18 months (2101, 4578, 15353, 15354, 15520, 46587, 46673, 46690, 46753, 46838, 102164, 103278, 108336).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, long-term.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, creatine is generally well-tolerated. Topically, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Dehydration, diarrhea, gastrointestinal upset, muscle cramps, and water retention.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Case reports have raised concerns about interstitial nephritis, renal insufficiency, rhabdomyolysis, and venous thrombosis.\nCardiovascular\nSome research suggests that creatine supplementation can cause edema. In a randomized controlled trial, 26% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) receiving creatine 10 grams daily reported edema after 2 months of treatment compared to 9% with placebo. The difference between groups was statistically significant at 2 months but not at month 4 and beyond. Creatine is believed to cause slight water retention, which may have been more apparent in patients who were immobilized due to ALS (46647). While this adverse drug reaction did not lead to worsening cardiac function in these patients, theoretically, creatine-related water retention could worsen congestive heart failure or hypertension.\n\nThere is one case report of lone atrial fibrillation in a 30-year-old male vegetarian. He started powdered creatine 20 grams daily for 5 days, followed by 2.5 grams daily for a month. However, he discontinued powdered creatine due to severe cramping and diarrhea, and reinitiated creatine supplementation a month later with an encapsulated formulation. Aside from gelatin in the capsule, creatine was the only ingredient listed in both formulations. During the loading dose phase, the patient developed dyspnea and palpitations and was diagnosed with lone atrial fibrillation in the emergency department. Symptoms resolved with treatment and supplement discontinuation (13187). Theoretically, alterations in electrolyte balance due to dehydration or diarrhea could lead to conduction abnormalities and arrhythmia; however, in this case, the patient had normal electrolyte levels. Contaminants in dietary supplements might also be responsible for adverse reactions; this specific creatine product was not tested for contaminants. It remains unclear whether creatine was associated with this event.\n\nTheoretically, taking creatine nitrate might reduce blood pressure and heart rate due to its nitrate component. However, clinical research shows that creatine nitrate 12 grams daily for 7 days followed by 3 grams daily for 21 days does not lower blood pressure or heart rate acutely or chronically when compared to creatine monohydrate or placebo (95959).\nless\nDermatologic\nIn a small clinical trial of older, healthy males, one subject out of the 10 receiving creatine 5 grams four times daily for 10 days followed by 4 grams daily for 20 days reported a skin rash during the study. The type and severity of rash and whether it resolved after creatine was discontinued were not discussed (4572). Also, skin rash has been reported by patients taking celecoxib and creatine; however, whether this effect was due to creatine or celecoxib is unclear (46706).\n\nTopically, burning, itching, redness, irritation, and perception of changes in skin temperature have been reported (104669).\nless\nEndocrine\nCreatine may influence insulin production (11330). In human research, insulin levels increased 120 and 240 minutes after creatine supplementation (46760); however, there was no effect in another trial (46732). In a clinical study, 0.3 grams/kg of creatine daily for one week significantly increased cortisol levels by 29%. However, the levels returned to baseline at week 2 (46615).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nSome small clinical studies have reported diarrhea and vomiting with oral creatine supplementation (4584, 11332, 46562, 46684, 46698, 46704, 104673). Also, gastrointestinal distress, transient abdominal discomfort, constipation, heartburn, and nausea have been reported by a small number of individuals in randomized, controlled clinical trials (4572, 11332, 46527, 46528, 46573, 46589, 46622, 46668, 46684, 46695), (46704, 46771, 95964, 104668, 104669, 104673, 108316). However, most high-quality clinical research shows that creatine does not increase the incidence of gastrointestinal upset (103102, 103278, 103279).\n\nUndissolved creatine powder may cause gastroenteritis (1368). Additionally, simultaneous intake of creatine and caffeine powder may increase the occurrence of gastrointestinal distress (95964).\nless\nHematologic\nThere are two case reports of creatine-related venous thrombosis in otherwise healthy adults. In the first case, an active 18-year-old male who had been taking an unspecified dose of creatine daily for 3 months was diagnosed with venous thrombosis via MRI. The patient reported increased thirst and fluid consumption when taking creatine. In the second case, an active 31-year-old male who had recently taken a 5-hour flight was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. He had been taking an unspecified dose of creatine. After stopping creatine and receiving anticoagulation therapy for 6 months, both patients' thromboses were resolved and did not recur. Researchers speculate that dehydration might be to blame for these adverse events, as dehydration increases the risk of thrombosis. In both cases, thrombophilic conditions were ruled out, and a temporal relationship between creatine consumption and thrombosis was established (90301). However, it remains unclear if creatine was responsible for these thrombotic events.\nless\nHepatic\nDespite two case reports describing hepatic injury in patients taking creatine (46701, 90319), meta-analyses and clinical studies specifically evaluating the safety of creatine have not identified an increased risk for hepatic injury (103278, 103279). In addition, population research suggests that there is not an association between creatine intake and liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatic steatosis. However, this study largely included subjects consuming less than 4 grams daily (112208).\n\nOne preliminary clinical trial specifically evaluated the effect of creatine loading and maintenance doses on hepatic function indices in healthy adults. No clinically significant changes in hepatic indices were reported in patients taking creatine loading doses of 20 grams daily for 5 days followed by maintenance doses of 3 grams daily for 8 weeks (46521). Another clinical study evaluated the impact of creatine monohydrate and creatine nitrate on liver function enzymes, showing no change in levels within 5 hours after the first dose of 12 grams or after continued consumption of 12 grams daily for 7 days followed by 3 grams daily for 21 days (95959). The patients that experienced hepatic injury in the available case reports were also taking other exercise supplements. Whether the reported adverse hepatic effects were due to creatine or the other supplements patients were taking is unclear. Also, neither of these case reports addressed whether the supplements were tested for contamination (46701, 90319).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nCreatine-associated increase in body mass is well documented in randomized, controlled clinical trials and is often as large as 1-2 kg during the five-day loading period of creatine (2101, 4569, 4589, 4591, 4600, 4605, 46504, 46561, 46815, 46827)(46830, 46843, 95962, 103279, 112201). This may be considered an unwanted adverse reaction in some individuals and a desired effect of supplementation in others. This weight gain may interfere with mass-dependent activities such as running and swimming (46504, 46823). Muscle cramping due to creatine supplementation has been reported in controlled clinical trials and may result from water retention in skeletal muscle (2104, 4572, 4584, 30915, 46562, 46695, 46826, 46827, 104673). However, most high quality clinical research shows that creatine does not increase the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries or muscle cramping (103102). In one case report, rhabdomyolysis in a weight lifter using creatine 25 grams daily over a one-year period has been reported (12820). Another case report describes an adult male who developed acute compartment syndrome of the leg after regular consumption of an unspecified amount of creatine and cocaine (112210).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nIn clinical research, thirst, sleepiness, mild headache, and syncope have been reported for patients taking creatine, although the events were uncommon (46578, 46615, 46820). More serious adverse events have been reported for patients taking creatine in combination with other ingredients. A case of ischemic stroke has been reported for an athlete who consumed creatine monohydrate 6 grams, caffeine 400-600 mg, ephedra 40-60 mg, and a variety of other supplements daily for 6 weeks (1275). In another case, a 26 year old male reported with a hemorrhagic stroke linked to taking the supplement Jack3d, which contains creatine, DMAA, schizandrol A, caffeine, beta-alanine, and L-arginine alpha-ketoglutarate (90318). It is likely that these adverse events were due to other ingredients, such as caffeine, ephedra, and DMAA, which are known to have stimulant and vasoconstrictive properties.\nless\nOncologic\nPopulation research shows that use of muscle building supplements such as creatine, protein, and androstenedione is associated with an increased odds of testicular germ cell cancer. This risk appears to be more apparent in early users, those using two or more muscle building supplements, and those with long-term use of the supplements. The odds of testicular germ cell cancer may be increased by up to 155% in males taking both creatine and protein supplements (90329). The risk of testicular germ cell cancer from creatine alone is unclear from this study.\nless\nPsychiatric\nAnxiety, irritability, depression, aggression, and nervousness have been reported in clinical research for patients taking creatine, although the effects are not common (46518). A case of acute organic psychosis was reported in a 32-year-old soldier in Iraq who was consuming excessive amounts of caffeine coupled with use of creatine (Creatamax, MaxiNutrition) one tablet twice daily for 3 weeks plus a specific stimulant containing bitter orange, guarana seed extract, and St. John's wort extract (Ripped Fuel Ephedra Free, Twinlabs) two tablets three times daily for 2 days prior to admission. The psychosis was considered likely due to caffeine consumption in combination with the stimulant supplement rather than creatine (37982).\nless\nRenal\nIsolated cases of renal dysfunction in patients taking creatine have been reported, including a case of interstitial nephritis in a healthy male (184) and a case of renal insufficiency in a football player (46828). In contrast to these cases, several clinical studies and case reports have shown that creatine does not affect markers of renal function in healthy adults (2120, 3996, 4573, 16535, 46735, 46749, 46758, 46779, 46813, 95959, 103279). Doses studied included 5- to 7-day loading regimens of 12 to 21 grams daily (2120, 46813), or maintenance doses of 3-10 grams daily for up to 2 years (16535, 46712, 46758, 95959). In two additional studies, creatine supplementation 15.75 grams for 5 days followed by 4.25 grams daily for 20 days with carbohydrate and protein ingestion led to no change of renal stress markers (46844). Other clinical research has shown that ingestion of creatine up to 30 grams daily for 5 years is not associated with an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (103102).\n\nOther case reports involve patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction. For example, in one case, a patient with a history of recurrent renal failure developed relapsing steroid-responsive nephritis syndrome after taking creatine (1368, 2118). In another case, a patient with diabetic nephropathy who was taking creatine and metformin developed severe metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure. It is unclear if creatine contributed to this event, as metformin alone is known to cause metabolic acidosis (46738). These case reports have raised concern that individuals with pre-existing renal dysfunction may be at increased risk for renal injury with creatine supplementation. However, no prospective clinical trials have been conducted in this population to clarify this concern.\n\nIn addition, two cases of acute kidney injury and hypercalcemia have been reported in 16 year old males that took 1-4 servings of creatine for less than 4 weeks; however, the creatine product contained unlabeled, very high doses of vitamin D, which is the likely cause of these symptoms (109739).\n\nIn one survey, 13% of male collegiate athletes taking creatine reported dehydration (4584). The Association of Professional Team Physicians has warned that creatine may cause dehydration, heat-related illnesses, and electrolyte imbalances, and reduce blood volume. Mild transient dehydration resulting in an elevated serum creatinine was also reported in a single person in a clinical trial (104672). However, a study found that creatine supplementation during preseason football training had no effect on fluid or electrolyte status (46845). Additionally, most high quality clinical research shows that creatine does not increase dehydration (103102). A theoretical increase in risk of dehydration due to intracellular fluid shifts has led most creatine manufacturers to caution about adequate hydration with creatine supplementation (4576).\nless\nOther\nThere have been reports of heat intolerance with oral creatine supplementation (46505). Increases in formaldehyde production have been reported with creatine use. A-24 year-old man taking supratherapeutic doses of creatine monophosphate in combination with an energy supplement developed malignant hyperthermia after undergoing anesthesia. His symptoms included tachycardia, hypertension, hypercarbia, and hyperthermia. Environmental factors are suspected to have played a role in the development of malignant hyperthermia, so whether this adverse event was due to creatine at all is unclear (46717).\n\nIn 1997, three collegiate wrestlers died after engaging in a rapid weight-loss program in order to qualify for competition (93628). Initially creatine supplementation was considered to have contributed to or caused these deaths (12820, 93629); however, investigations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not confirm this belief (12820, 93630). It appears that only one of the three wrestlers had been using creatine. Instead, the deaths were related to drastic, short-term weight loss in which the wrestlers wore rubber suits, avoided hydration, and performed workouts in rooms with temperatures up to 33 °C (1368, 93631).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Oral creatine monohydrate seems to modestly improve rowing, jumping, and soccer performance. It is unclear if it is beneficial for sprinting, cycling, swimming, or tennis performance.\nIn competitive rowers, most clinical research shows that taking creatine 20 grams or 240-250 mg/kg daily for 5 days significantly improves aerobic and anaerobic performance (4605, 4607, 46569, 46605, 46833). Specifically, creatine decreases 1000-meter rowing time by 2.4 seconds and 2500-meter rowing time by 6.5 seconds and increases time to fatigue by 9.7 seconds when compared with placebo (4607, 46605, 46833). To improve rowing performance, creatine 20 grams (or 240-250 mg/kg) daily for 5 days has been used (4605, 4607, 46605, 46833). Additionally, most clinical research shows that taking creatine 20-30 grams daily for 5-7 days improves jumping height by up to 6 cm when compared with placebo in active males (11331, 13661, 46626, 46704), although some conflicting results exist (6924, 46601). When compared with placebo, creatine also appears to improve spike jumping and block jumping in male volleyball players (46762), as well as peak and mean power of stationary roundhouse kicks in male trained taekwondo athletes (108333). In young male soccer players, preliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 10 grams three times daily for 7 days can increase performance on a specific dribbling speed test by up to 2.8 seconds when compared with placebo (46626). In young female soccer players, preliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 5 grams four times daily for 7 days followed by 5 grams daily for 5 weeks in conjunction with plyometric training modestly increases body mass index, jump and power performance, and repeated sprinting performance when compared with either plyometric training with placebo or standard soccer drills (95961).\n\nResearch evaluating creatine supplementation for sprinting, cycling, high-intensity-interval training (HIIT), and swimming has been inconsistent. The reason for these mixed findings is unclear. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that taking creatine decreases the peak oxygen uptake (VO2 max) during running and cycling, suggesting a worsening of aerobic fitness (108330). However, another meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows that taking creatine up to 20 grams orally daily for 3-7 days modestly improves mean power, but not peak power or fatigue, during repeated running or cycling sprint intervals when compared with placebo (112206). In addition, a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in trained athletes shows that taking creatine up to 20 grams orally daily for 5-42 days does not improve endurance running or cycling performance when compared with control (112214). A potential explanation for these conflicting results is that the studies failing to show an improvement are likely underpowered, with sample sizes of only 6-32 subjects (4582, 4601). For instance, some small clinical trials show that taking creatine 20-30 grams daily for 5-7 days can improve sprint times by up to 3% and decrease time to exhaustion by up to 13% when compared with placebo in trained athletes (6924, 11331, 46558, 46567, 46626, 46819); however, others show that taking creatine 20-25 grams daily for 3-7 days does not improve sprint velocity, 60-meter or 150-meter sprint times, or fatigue in these individuals (46603, 46656, 46797, 46806, 112216). In trained athletes, untrained yet healthy adults, and sedentary adults, some clinical research shows that taking creatine 10-35 grams daily for 4-7 days significantly improves power output, peak power, and fatigue indices while cycling (4591, 4592, 4593, 4594, 4602, 4604, 6926, 10064, 46522, 46528) (46547, 46568, 46601, 46614, 46820); however, significant improvements in cycling performance with creatine are lacking in other studies (4582, 4595, 4596, 4597, 4598, 4599, 4600, 4606, 46520, 46538) (46646). Similarly, in trained swimmers, some clinical research shows that creatine improves swimming performance (4601, 4603, 46600, 46655, 46725, 46805), with a few studies reporting improvements of 1.3-2 seconds in 100-meter swim times when compared with placebo (46600, 46725, 46805). However, creatine does not improve 25-, 50-, or 100-meter swim performance in other trials (2106, 4601, 46798). To improve swimming performance, creatine 9-25 grams daily for 4-9 days has been used (4601, 4603, 46600, 46655, 46725, 46805), with lower maintenance doses of 2.25-10 grams daily for 8-9 days used in some cases (4601, 46600). Preliminary clinical research in trained tennis players shows that taking creatine 5 grams four times daily for 5 days or 0.3 grams/kg daily for 6 days followed by 0.03 grams/kg daily for 4 weeks does not appear to improve stroke power, stroke precision, serving speed, sprinting, or shuttle run time when compared with placebo (46536, 46673). Taking creatine (Creapure, AlzChem AG) 0.3 grams/kg daily for 5 days, followed by 0.1 grams/kg daily for 23 days, while undergoing HITT 3 days each week does not improve physical performance outcomes when compared with placebo in healthy young females (95965).\n\nA preliminary clinical trial in elite female handball players shows that the beneficial effects of creatine monohydrate 0.3 grams/kg for 5 days followed by 0.03 grams/kg are not dependent on the time of day of supplementation (108332). Although this suggests that the circadian rhythm does not influence the ergogenic effect of creatine, this study was small and may have been underpowered to detect any differences.\n\nOne clinical study in actively training firefighters shows that adding creatine 5 grams to daily supplemental protein and carbohydrates for 3 weeks reduces rescue and forcible entry times, but does not improve hose line advance, stair climb, or aerobic speed times, when compared with protein and carbohydrate supplementation alone (113673).\n\nOne clinical study compared the efficacy of creatine monohydrate with that of creatine nitrate. At equivalent doses of 12 grams daily for 7 days, followed by 3 grams daily for 21 days, creatine nitrate and creatine monohydrate produce similar increases in fat-free mass, lean mass, and intramuscular creatine concentrations, and similar improvements in bench press lifting volume and average power output. The lower dose of creatine nitrate 6 grams daily for 7 days followed by 1.5 grams daily for 21 days does not demonstrate performance improvement benefits or result in increased intramuscular creatine (95959). In 2018, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) recommended creatine monohydrate, but not creatine nitrate, as an ergogenic nutritional supplement for increasing athletic capacity and lean body mass (101009).\n\nCreatine has also been evaluated in combination with caffeine. A very small clinical study in healthy adult males shows that taking creatine 20 grams daily for a 5-day loading period and then adding caffeine 5 mg/kg daily for the next 3 days improves anaerobic power, but not anaerobic capacity, when compared with placebo (115980). Further research is needed to determine whether creatine is beneficial when taken with other erogenic ingredients.\nless\nCerebral creatine deficiency syndromes. Oral creatine seems to improve some symptoms of the cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency and arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for creatine transporter defect.\nThree inborn errors of metabolism, GAMT deficiency, AGAT deficiency, and creatine transporter defect, cause low cerebral creatine levels, resulting in mental retardation, seizures, autism, and movement disorders. In children with GAMT deficiency, taking creatine orally, 400-500 mg/kg daily for up to 8 years or 4-8 grams daily for up to 25 months, increases brain creatine levels and improves movement disorders and seizure frequency, but has little effect on intellectual ability (46722, 46796, 46804). Children with AGAT deficiency who take creatine 400-800 mg/kg daily for up to 8 years seem to have improved attention, language development, and academic performance (46584, 46769). However, research in children up to 10 years of age with creatine transporter defect shows that taking a mixture of creatine, L-arginine, and glycine orally for 4-6 years does not increase brain creatine levels or improve motor or cognitive functioning (46757).\nless\nMuscle strength. Oral creatine seems to modestly improve muscle strength. It is unclear if topical creatine is beneficial.\nPooled analyses of clinical trials assessing upper limb strength, lower limb strength, and body composition have evaluated creatine provided in typical loading doses of 20 grams daily or 0.3 grams/kg daily, although doses up to 26 grams daily have been used, in single or divided doses for 5-7 days (90323, 90330, 93626, 93627, 108316, 108336, 112213). Creatine maintenance doses ranged from 1.25-27 grams daily for up to 32 weeks (90323, 90330, 93626, 93627, 108316, 108336, 115978). In some studies, creatine doses of usually 0.1 grams/kg have been taken daily for up to 12 months in the absence of a loading dose. In others, creatine was taken only on training days (108316).\n\nMeta-analyses of research in the general adult population show that taking creatine with or without resistance training seems to improve handgrip strength, upper limb strength, and lower limb strength, with a small-to-moderate overall effect (93626, 93627). In combination with resistance training, creatine also appears to be beneficial for upper and/or lower limb strength in older adults and those at risk for functional disability, although benefits on both domains have not been demonstrated in all analyses (90323, 90330, 108316, 108336, 115978). A meta-analysis limited to studies involving older females shows that while taking creatine with resistance training increases upper body strength when compared with placebo, improvements to lower body strength are limited to those studies providing supplementation for at least 24 weeks (108336). Meta-analyses of studies involving middle-aged adults, older adults, and those with chronic conditions at risk for functional disability show that creatine supplementation combined with resistance training appears to increase total body mass by 1 kg and lean body mass by 0.9-1.3 kg when compared with placebo (90323, 90330, 108316, 115978). However, other meta-analyses of studies in older adults show no effect of creatine combined with resistance exercise on muscle mass or absolute fat mass, while effects on body fat percentage are inconsistent (90323, 108335, 108336, 113671).\n\nWhile the analyses above provide a good estimate of creatine's effect on muscle strength, it is important to note that a large number of clinical trials assessing strength in patients taking creatine have been published. These studies included varying methodologies, small sample sizes, and a wide range of creatine doses, dosing times, and study durations. These differences may explain why some studies have found a benefit with creatine supplementation (2100, 2101, 4580, 6015, 6924, 6928, 10062, 13661, 46507, 46510)(46523, 46528, 46550, 46551, 46561, 46562, 46567, 46570, 46581, 46589)(46601, 46613, 46615, 46618, 46626, 46628, 46667, 46709, 46720, 46725)(46761, 46762, 46801, 46815, 90321, 90327, 95958, 95960, 102162, 103279)(104668, 104670, 108329, 112213, 112793), while others have not (4569, 4570, 4571, 4572, 4588, 6183, 46520, 46539, 46554, 46569)(46579, 46594, 46656, 46665, 46673, 95963, 95967, 95968, 95969, 102168, 104669)(104671, 108334).\n\nTopical creatine has also been evaluated. Applying 3.5 mL of a specific cream (Delivra, LivCorp Inc.) containing creatine 1% daily for 7 days moderately improves peak and average muscle power in healthy males when compared with a placebo cream. However, some study participants were also taking oral creatine monohydrate 7 grams three times daily and others were taking an oral placebo. An acute application of the cream at doses of 3.5 mL or 7 mL 30 minutes before exercise does not improve power (104669).\nless\nSarcopenia. When used for up to 12 weeks in combination with resistance training, oral creatine seems to modestly improve muscle strength in older adults. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial when used as a single dose or for more than 12 weeks.\nMost research shows that taking creatine while taking part in a resistance training program can increase upper and/or lower body muscle strength in older adults (90323, 90330, 95958, 102162, 108316, 108336). One meta-analysis of research in adults 50 years of age and older taking part in resistance training programs shows that creatine supplementation improves chest press strength with a moderate effect size, but does not improve leg press strength, when compared with placebo (90330). Also, another meta-analysis focusing on adults 45 years of age and older taking part in resistance training shows that creatine supplementation improves chest press strength by 1.74 kg and leg press strength by 3.25 kg when compared with placebo, with no effect on knee extension or biceps curl measurements (90323). A meta-analysis limited to studies involving older females shows that while taking creatine with resistance training increases upper body strength when compared with placebo, improvements to lower body strength are limited to those studies providing supplementation for at least 24 weeks (108336).\n\nHowever, some negative findings exist. Some clinical research in postmenopausal females with osteopenia shows that taking creatine monohydrate 1-3 grams (Creapure, AlzChem AG) daily for 1-2 years without participation in resistance training does not alter muscle function when compared with placebo (95969, 102168). In addition, in healthy males aged 49-69 years, a small clinical trial shows that taking creatine monohydrate (Rivalus Inc.) 0.05 grams/kg twice daily, while undergoing supervised resistance training three days each week for one year, does not alter muscle strength when compared with placebo (104671). One clinical study shows that a single loading dose of creatine monohydrate 20 grams (Creapure, AlzCHem AG) taken 3 hours prior to exercise does not improve leg press or chest press muscle endurance in aging males (95968). Also, lower doses of creatine added to whey protein supplementation do not seem to be beneficial. One small study in adults 65 years or older shows that adding creatine monohydrate 2.5 grams twice daily along with whey protein 10 grams twice daily and resistance training for 14 weeks does not improve muscle function when compared with whey protein and resistance training alone (95966).\n\nMost research also suggests that creatine improves total muscle mass in older adults, although conflicting research exists. Some studies show that taking creatine while taking part in a resistance training program seems to increase muscle mass in older adults (90323, 90330, 108316, 108329). Meta-analyses of studies involving middle-aged and older adults show that creatine supplementation combined with resistance training appears to increase total body mass by 1 kg and lean body mass by 0.9-1.3 kg when compared with placebo (90323, 90330, 108316). However, a meta-analysis of studies limited to older females shows that there was no effect of creatine on muscle mass (108336). Also, in healthy males aged 49-69 years, a small clinical trial shows that taking creatine monohydrate (Rivalus Inc.) 0.05 grams/kg twice daily, while undergoing supervised resistance training three days each week for one year, does not alter body composition when compared with placebo (104671).\n\nDespite these generally beneficial findings, significant decreases in fat mass following creatine supplementation in older adults are lacking, and effects on body fat percentage are inconsistent (90323, 95958, 108335).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Oral creatine does not seem to reduce ALS symptoms or increase survival.\nTaking creatine orally, 5-10 grams daily for 9-16 months, or 20 grams daily for 5-7 days followed by 3-5 grams daily for 6 months, has no effect on disease progression, respiratory function decline, or survival in patients with ALS (11332, 16389, 46553, 46574, 46707). In one case series, some patients experienced temporary improvement in muscle strength while taking 20 grams daily during the first week, but this was not maintained (46553).\nless\nHuntington disease. Oral creatine does not seem to reduce symptoms of this condition.\nTaking creatine orally has no effect on motor function or symptom scores in people with Huntington disease (46598, 46609, 95957). Clinical research shows that taking creatine 5-40 grams daily (average dose of 31.6 grams) for 24 months does not improve total motor score or total functional capacity in patients with early manifest Huntington disease (95957).\nless\nOsteopenia. Oral creatine does not seem to be beneficial for osteopenia.\nIn postmenopausal adults with osteopenia, taking creatine monohydrate (Creapure, AlzChem GmbH ) 1-3 grams daily for 1-2 years does not improve bone mineral density (BMD) when compared with placebo (95969, 102168). Another clinical trial in postmenopausal adults with osteopenia or osteoporosis shows that taking creatine monohydrate (Probiotica) 20 grams daily for 5 days and then 5 grams daily for the next 23 weeks, with or without exercise training, does not improve bone mass when compared with placebo (90321). Also, a small clinical trial in older adults, most of which had osteopenia, shows that taking creatine monohydrate (Rivalus Inc.) 0.05 grams/kg twice daily in combination with resistance training for 12 months modestly improves some measures of bone area, but not BMD, when compared with placebo (108329).\n\nOther research has evaluated creatine in patients without a definite diagnosis of osteopenia. One study shows that taking creatine (Rivalus Inc.) 0.1 gram/kg daily for 12 months or creatine (Creapure AlzChem Trostberg GmbH) 0.1 grams/kg three times weekly does not affect BMD in adults age 50 and up taking part in resistance training (104671, 104674). In contrast, a small clinical trial in postmenopausal patients shows that taking creatine monohydrate (Rivalus Inc.) 0.1 gram/kg daily for 12 months while undergoing a resistance training program has a small preventive effect on bone loss at the femoral neck, but not the hip or spine (104673). However, other preliminary clinical research in postmenopausal patients shows that taking creatine (Creapure, AlzChem AG) 0.14 grams/kg orally daily for 2 years does not improve BMD when compared with placebo (112219). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 0.3 grams/kg for 5 days and 0.07 grams/kg for the remainder of a 12-week resistance training session increases BMD in elderly males over 70 years (46664). More information is needed to determine if creatine is beneficial when used in combination with a resistance training program in older adults.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of age-related cognitive decline.\nPopulation research in the US has found a positive association between dietary creatine intake and a specific measure of cognitive function, the WAIS III Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSS). In addition, this measure of cognitive function was highest in individuals who consumed more than 0.95 grams daily (108331). However, clinical research is conflicting. A small clinical trial in older adults shows that taking creatine monohydrate (Creapure, Deguss AG) 5 grams four times daily for one week has modest beneficial effects on some measures of cognitive function, but not others, when compared with baseline or placebo (46686). Another small clinical trial shows that taking creatine monohydrate 5 grams four times daily for five days, and then 5 grams daily for a total of 4 weeks, does not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo (108339).\nless\nAging skin. Topical creatine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a cream containing creatine 0.2%, guarana 0.4%, and glycerol 8% to the face daily for 6 weeks reduces wrinkles and skin sagging when compared to baseline (46766). Other research shows that a specific cream containing creatine 0.2% and folic acid 0.03% (Nivea Visage DNAage, Beiersdorf AG) reduces wrinkles and roughness and improves firmness of photo-aged skin when compared to baseline (46696). The effect of topical creatine alone on aging skin is unclear. Also, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nArsenic poisoning. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with arsenic poisoning.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults regularly consuming well water that contains arsenic shows that taking creatine 3 grams orally daily for 12 weeks lowers the concentration of certain serum arsenic metabolites when compared with control (112212). Creatine has not been studied for management of acute arsenic poisoning.\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for improving post-viral CFS.\nA very small clinical study in adults who developed CFS after COVID-19 shows that taking creatine 4 grams with breakfast daily for 6 months improves body aches and the ability to concentrate, but does not affect fatigue levels or time to exhaustion, when compared with an inulin placebo (113487). Although many other CFS-related symptoms were evaluated in this study, no statistical methods were implemented to control for multiplicity, limiting the interpretation of any additional findings.\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in adults with CKD.\nA small clinical study in adults with CKD undergoing hemodialysis shows that taking creatine monohydrate 20 grams daily for a week alternating with 5 grams daily for a week, for a total of 4 weeks, attenuates loss of lean body mass and reduces the malnutrition-inflammation score when compared with taking a maltodextrin control (102166). However, another very small clinical study evaluating the same regimen over a period of 12 months shows no improvement in malnutrition-inflammation score, body composition, strength, or endurance when compared with a maltodextrin control (115981).\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with COPD.\nOne clinical study shows that taking creatine 22 grams daily for 5 days, then 3.76 grams daily for 6 weeks, does not improve pulmonary function or walking distance when compared with placebo (46699). Another study shows taking creatine 5.7 grams three times daily for 2 weeks, then once daily thereafter, improves patient self-assessment of lung function, but not exercise capacity, when compared with placebo (46658). A third study shows taking creatine 0.3 grams/kg for 7 days, then 0.07 grams/kg for 7 weeks, improves walking time, but not measures of lung function, when compared with placebo (46691). A meta-analysis of the results from these and other clinical trials shows that creatine does not improve exercise capacity, muscle strength, or quality of life in COPD patients. However, the studies analyzed were of varying quality, which may limit the validity of these findings (46740).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for improving cognitive function.\nSome preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking creatine possibly improves some measures of cognitive performance, specifically short-term memory and reasoning. However, findings related to most measures of cognitive function are inconsistent (108340). Other clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking a specific creatine product (Creapure, AlzChem) 5-20 grams orally daily for 6 weeks does not improve cognitive function, abstract reasoning, or working memory when compared with placebo (112215, 113486).\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with CHF.\nTwo very small clinical studies show that taking creatine orally 20 grams daily for 5-10 days improves skeletal muscle strength and endurance, but not ejection fraction or symptoms of CHF, when compared with placebo (4562, 4563). Also a small clinical study in males with class II-IV heart failure shows that taking creatine 5 grams daily for 6 months does not improve exercise capacity or ejection fraction when compared with placebo (90328). However, it is possible that these small studies were inadequately powered to detect a difference in these clinical outcomes.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for improving symptoms of depression.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 5 grams daily for 8 weeks improves response to escitalopram in females with major depressive disorder. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores decreased by 80% when compared to baseline in those receiving creatine plus escitalopram, compared to a decrease of only 63% in those taking placebo plus escitalopram (46777). However, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce recommend against use of creatine for depression until more conclusive data are generated (110318).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for glycemic control.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine does not affect levels of fasting blood glucose or measures of insulin resistance when compared with placebo (108338). However, most of the studies included in this analysis were not conducted in individuals with diabetes. In people with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, preliminary clinical studies show a reduction in postprandial glucose levels after taking creatine 3-6 grams orally daily for 5 days (46732, 46760). The studies show that creatine 3 grams once daily has similar effects to glyburide 3.5 mg daily, and that creatine 3 grams twice daily is similar to metformin 500 mg twice daily. The effects of treatment for longer than 5 days in patients with diabetes are unknown. However, in sedentary males without diabetes, taking creatine 10 grams daily for 3 months seems to improve glucose tolerance (46682).\nless\nFatigue. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for cognitive fatigue prevention.\nA small clinical study in healthy young adults with mental fatigue shows that taking creatine monohydrate (Sportimaxx) 20 grams daily for 7 days improves accuracy on prolonged cognitive tasks, but not cognitive measures that require a quick response, when compared with placebo (102170).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for improving exercise performance in patients with fibromyalgia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 5 grams orally four times daily for 5 days, followed by 5 grams daily for a total of 16 weeks, improves leg press strength by 10% and chest press strength by 8% when compared with placebo in patients with fibromyalgia. However, creatine supplementation does not appear to improve aerobic capacity, pain, sleep, quality of life, or cognitive function (90331).\nless\nHereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with hereditary motor sensory neuropathies.\nPreliminary clinical studies in people with hereditary motor sensory neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, suggest that taking creatine orally 5 grams daily for 1-12 weeks has no effect on muscle strength, endurance, or functional capacity when compared with placebo (46548, 46630, 46675, 46695).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related wasting. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with muscle wasting associated with HIV.\nA small clinical study shows that taking creatine orally 20 grams daily for 5 days, then 4.8 grams daily for 14 weeks, does not increase muscle mass or strength in patients with HIV with muscle wasting when compared with placebo (46718).\nless\nHyperhomocysteinemia. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia.\nPreliminary clinical research in strict vegan adults with hyperhomocysteinemia shows that taking micronized creatine monohydrate (Bioderm) 5 grams daily for 3 weeks reduces blood levels of homocysteine by 39% when compared with baseline (102169). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nInflammatory myopathies. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.\nPreliminary clinical research in people with dermatomyositis or polymyositis shows that taking creatine orally 20 grams daily for 8 days, followed by 3 grams daily for a total of 6 months, in addition to an exercise program, decreases aggregate functional performance time by around 7% and increases shoulder abduction and hip flexion strength when compared with placebo. However, no improvements in functional index or strength as measured by elbow flexion, knee extension, or dorsi flexion are reported (15520). Taking creatine does not seem to improve muscle strength or disease activity in patients aged 7-18 years with juvenile dermatomyositis. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine (AlzChem) for 4 weeks to 6 months does not improve muscle strength or disease activity when compared with placebo. The doses used in this study were 150 mg/kg daily for children weighing up to 40 kg or 4.69 grams/m2 for those weighing over 40 kg (104672).\nless\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Oral creatine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn children with JIA, taking a specific supplement (Kre-Celazine; All American Pharmaceutical) containing creatine and fatty acids 750 mg twice daily for 30 days may improve pain and inflammation when compared to baseline. Pain scores were reduced to 0 or 1 in 81% of these patients, and laboratory measures of inflammation were normalized in nearly every patient (90322). However, the effect of creatine alone in JIA patients is unclear. Also, the validity of this study is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nMcArdle disease. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for this condition.\nThere is some preliminary clinical evidence that taking creatine orally, 150 mg/kg daily for 5 days, followed by 60 mg/kg daily for 5 weeks, improves frequency and/or severity of muscle pain in some, but not all, patients with McArdle disease (70). However, continuing with the higher dose of 150 mg/kg daily throughout the 5-week period seems to INCREASE muscle pain and exercise intolerance (46564).\nless\nMemory. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for improving memory.\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in healthy adults shows that taking creatine 2.2-20 grams orally for 5 days to 24 weeks improves performance on certain memory tests when compared with placebo (112202). However, the validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity. In addition, the statistical methods utilized in this meta-analysis are likely to increase the risk of false positive results (112203) and re-analysis using other methods failed to reproduce the significant effects of creatine (112204).\nless\nMitochondrial myopathies. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with mitochondrial myopathies.\nPreliminary studies using creatine orally for mitochondrial myopathies, such as chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Kearns-Sayre syndrome, show mixed results. Using 150 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks or 20 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve muscle function, exercise performance, or ease of completing activities of daily living when compared with placebo (46529, 46650, 104675). However, one very small clinical study shows that taking creatine 5 grams twice daily for 14 days, then 2 grams twice daily for 7 days, improves some measures of strength during high-intensity anaerobic and aerobic exercise, but not low-intensity exercise, when compared with baseline (4565).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with MS.\nA very small clinical study shows that taking creatine 20 grams orally daily for 5 days does not improve exercise capacity in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis when compared with placebo (46599).\nless\nMuscle breakdown. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for muscle breakdown prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 5 grams four times daily for 7 days seems to help maintain muscle mass and reduce loss of muscle strength associated with immobilization by a cast in young males aged 18-25 years (46713).\nless\nMuscle cramps. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with muscle cramps related to hemodialysis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 12 grams orally 5 minutes before hemodialysis sessions for 4 weeks reduces the frequency of muscle cramps by around 60%, from an average of 6.4 episodes to 2.6 episodes over the course of 4 weeks of dialysis. No reduction in muscle cramp frequency is reported with placebo in these patients (46582).\nless\nMuscular dystrophy. The evidence for the use of oral creatine in patients with various forms of muscular dystrophy is conflicting.\nPreliminary studies have assessed oral creatine in patients with muscular dystrophy, including Duchenne dystrophy, Becker dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, sarcoglycan-deficient limb girdle muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophies. Although a meta-analysis of available research shows that there is a small benefit of creatine on muscle strength in patients with muscular dystrophies, results of individual clinical trials have been inconsistent (104675). Some preliminary clinical research shows that measures of muscle strength or fatigue are improved after 8-16 weeks of treatment with creatine 3-5 grams or 0.1 gram/kg daily (6182, 46596, 46629, 46739). Also, subjective improvement in muscle strength occurs in some people taking creatine 20 grams daily for one week, followed by 5 grams daily for 8 weeks (46639). The ability to perform activities of daily living improves only modestly, if at all (6182, 46629, 46739). Despite these positive results, some conflicting results exist. Some studies show no improvement in muscle strength or functional capacity with doses of 5 grams daily for 17-26 weeks (46616, 46657), or 10.6 grams daily for 10 days followed by 5.3 grams daily for a total of 8 weeks (46587). Also, a dose of 10 grams daily for 12 weeks does not appear to improve muscle strength, although it seems to improve myalgia in some patients (10654).\n\nThe inconsistent results reported in patients with muscular dystrophy may be explained by the different types of muscular dystrophies, the varied methodologies, or the small number of patients assessed. Studies failing to show an improvement with creatine may be underpowered, with sample sizes of only 20-60 (10654, 46657).\nless\nNeonatal apnea. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for neonatal apnea treatment.\nA preliminary clinical study shows that giving creatine orally 200 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks to premature infants with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks does not improve signs or symptoms of apnea of prematurity when compared with placebo (46623).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis.\nIn patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, preliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 20 grams orally daily for one week, followed by 5 grams daily for 11 weeks, in combination with strengthening exercises, modestly improves physical functioning as measured by the number of stand-ups performed from a standard-height chair in 30 seconds when compared with exercise alone. Stiffness, pain, and quality of life were also improved with creatine supplementation; however, it is unclear if these improvements were significant when compared with exercise alone (46753).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 5 grams twice daily for 12-18 months decreases the rate of disease progression when compared with placebo in patients who have not started conventional medications for symptom control (15353, 46703). However, preliminary clinical research in patients with more advanced disease who have already started conventional medications shows that taking creatine 20 grams daily for 6 days followed by 2 grams daily for 6 months, and then 4 grams daily for 18 months does not decrease overall progression of symptoms or the need to start symptomatic treatment. However, increases in dopamine agonist doses were 3-fold lower over the course of the study in patients receiving creatine when compared with placebo (15354).\nless\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with PAD.\nA small clinical trial in patients with PAD shows that taking creatine monohydrate (Creapure, AlzChem Trostberg GmbH) 5 grams four times daily for one week, followed by 5 grams daily for the next 7 weeks, does not improve functional capacity based on walking distance, upper body strength, or lower body strength, when compared with placebo (108337). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial for improving physical performance in older patients and those at risk for functional disability.\nA meta-analysis of 15 clinical studies in healthy older adults and adults of any age with chronic disease who are at risk for functional disability shows that taking oral creatine, usually at a dose of 5 grams daily, for 5 days to 32 weeks, improves lower extremity physical function, upper limb and hand strength, and lean tissue mass when compared with control. Taking creatine does not improve lower limb strength, functional mobility, walking time, or aerobic capacity. Subgroup analyses suggest that improvements are greater with an extended duration of creatine use. Additionally, combining creatine with resistance training may increase benefits for lower extremity physical function, upper body strength, and lean tissue mass (115978). The heterogeneity of the included patient populations limits the practical applicability of these findings.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Small clinical studies suggest that oral creatine may not improve recovery of muscle strength after knee surgery.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 20 grams daily for 7 days, followed by 5 grams daily for 11 weeks, does not improve recovery of muscle strength after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery in young adults when compared with placebo (46622). Other preliminary research shows that taking creatine 10 grams daily for 10 days before total knee arthroplasty, followed by 5 grams daily for 30 days after surgery, does not improve muscle strength or functional recovery when compared with placebo (46659). These studies are limited by small size and variability in patient population and supplementation regimen.\nless\nPost-stroke fatigue. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with post-stroke fatigue.\nVery preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing progressive resistance training after a stroke shows that taking a specific creatine supplement (Creapure, AlzChem Trostberg GmbH) 0.3 grams/kg orally daily for 7 days, followed by 0.1 grams/kg orally daily for a total of 10 weeks modestly improves 6-minute walk test distance when compared with placebo (112207).\nless\nRett syndrome. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine 200 mg/kg daily for 6 months does not improve symptom scores when compared with placebo in patients aged 3-25 years with Rett syndrome (46759).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral creatine does not seem to improve disease activity in patients with RA, but it might improve muscle strength.\nClinical research in adults with RA shows that taking creatine increases lean muscle mass, total body mass, and muscle strength, but does not alter disease activity or improve strength or physical function, when compared with placebo or a control group (6929, 95964). Creatine was taken as 5 grams four times daily for 5 days, followed by 3 grams daily for 12 weeks, in one study and 5 grams four times daily for 5 days, followed by 0.5 grams four times daily for 16 days, in the other study (6929).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in adults with schizophrenia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine orally, 3 grams daily for one month followed by 5 grams daily for 2 months, does not improve symptom control or cognitive function in adults with schizophrenia when compared with placebo (16390).\nless\nSleep deprivation. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in adults who are subjected to sleep deprivation.\nA small crossover study in healthy adults aged 20-28 years shows that taking a single oral dose of creatine 0.35 g/kg prior to sleep deprivation attenuates fatigue and cognitive decline over the next 7 hours when compared with placebo (115979).\nless\nSpinal cord injury. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with spinal cord injury.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine orally, 20 grams daily for 7 days, increases exercise capacity by improving respiratory function in patients with spinal cord injury (cervical level C5-7) when compared with placebo (46563). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that patients with similar injuries taking creatine 10 grams twice daily for 6 days, followed by 5 grams daily, do not have significant improvements in wrist muscle or hand function (46660).\nless\nSpinal muscular atrophy. It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in patients with spinal muscular atrophy.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that children with type II or III spinal muscular atrophy do not benefit from taking creatine orally for 6 months (46841). Doses were 2 grams daily for children aged 2-5 years, and 5 grams daily for children aged 5-18 years.\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear if oral creatine is beneficial in children with a TBI.\nIn children and adolescents who have suffered a TBI, preliminary clinical research shows that taking creatine orally 0.4 grams/kg daily for 6 months reduces the duration of post-traumatic amnesia by 60 days. It also reduces the risk of headache by 88%, fatigue by 87%, and dizziness by 80% when compared with control. There is also a trend towards reduced duration of intubation and total time in the intensive care unit or hospital (46694).\nless\nGyrate atrophy. Anecdotal reports suggest that oral creatine may be beneficial in some patients with gyrate atrophy.\nGyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina is associated with elevated plasma ornithine levels, which inhibit creatine synthesis and result in muscle fiber atrophy and eye fundus damage. Left untreated, patients with this condition progressively lose their vision (4577, 4578). A small case series suggests that taking creatine 1.5 grams daily for one year might slow eye damage and visual deterioration in some patients with this condition when compared to baseline (4578). The validity of this finding is limited by the small sample size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate creatine for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nCreatine has most often been used in a loading dose of up to 20 grams daily for up to 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.25-10 grams daily for up to 16 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nOral creatine supplements are available as solid dosage formulations or as solutions (90928). Most commercial creatine supplements contain creatine as the monohydrate salt (90928, 90929). However, other salt forms, including di-creatine citrate, are also available. In many cases, these other salt forms of creatine claim to have improved physical, chemical, and/or physiological properties (90929). For instance, di-creatine citrate has been shown to have better water solubility than creatine monohydrate (90928).\n\nCreatine nitrate has been claimed to produce higher intramuscular concentrations of creatine at a lower dose than creatine monohydrate, but clinical evidence does not support this claim (95959, 102167).",
            "Interactions with Drugs": "None known.",
            "Interactions with Supplements": "CAFFEINE\nTheoretically, concomitant use may increase the risk for serious adverse effects and reduce any beneficial effects of creatine.\nThere is some concern that combining caffeine, ephedra, and creatine might increase the risk of serious adverse effects. There is a report of ischemic stroke in an athlete who consumed creatine monohydrate 6 grams, caffeine 400-600 mg, ephedra 40-60 mg, and a variety of other supplements daily for 6 weeks (1275). Also, some preliminary clinical research shows that caffeine might decrease creatine's beneficial effects on athletic performance. Some researchers think caffeine can inhibit phosphocreatine resynthesis (2117, 4575).\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nBIPOLAR DISORDER\nTheoretically, taking creatine might increase the chance of mania. Monitor for worsening symptoms of mania in patients with bipolar disorder taking creatine products. Two cases of hypomania or mania have been reported in bipolar patients who took creatine monohydrate 3-5 grams daily for 3-4 weeks for treatment-resistant depression. It is unclear whether this switch was due to creatine; however, researchers note that a similar depression-to-mania switch has been reported in patients taking S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), which is a precursor to creatine (46690).\nless\nKIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\nTheoretically, taking creatine might worsen kidney dysfunction. Until more is known, use creatine with caution in patients with existing kidney dysfunction. Isolated case reports suggest that individuals with pre-existing kidney dysfunction may be at risk for worsening dysfunction with creatine supplementation (1368, 2118, 4576). However, this risk has not been evaluated in prospective clinical trials.\nless\nPARKINSON DISEASE\nThe combination of creatine and caffeine should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson disease. Creatine 10 grams daily in conjunction with caffeine consumption of greater than 300 mg daily might worsen the progression of Parkinson disease (95951).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with creatine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIntestinal absorption of creatine is nearly 100% (6052). Low-dose creatine (1 gram) creates a modest rise in plasma creatine in one hour while 5 grams results in a peak of 795 mcmol/L after one hour (4583). Repetitive dosing every two hours sustains plasma levels at approximately 1000 mcmol/L. Administration of 20 grams daily for two supplemental days results in a 50% increase in creatine content and renal excretion of 40%, 61%, and 68% on three subsequent days. Ingestion of 60 mg/kg of creatine monohydrate raises plasma creatine concentration above 500 mcM/L, which is the concentration required for muscle uptake (46833). This level is maintained for at least two hours. Absorption of creatine appears to be enhanced by concurrent carbohydrate ingestion (4589, 4605, 10063, 46593). Creatine ingested as a lozenge (crushed in the mouth and swallowed) or as a crystalline suspension in ice-cold water resulted in a 20% lower peak concentration and 30% to 35% smaller area under the plasma creatine concentration curve than the same dose administered in solution (46566). A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a single dose of creatine nitrate 3 grams by mouth results in higher levels of blood creatine for the first 90 minutes after administration when compared to taking a single dose of creatine monohydrate 3 grams. This difference is no longer present at 120 minutes. Furthermore, adding creatinine 3 grams to creatine nitrate 3 grams seems to increase the blood concentration of creatine when compared to taking creatine nitrate 3 grams alone (102167).\nDistribution\nThe total adult body pool of creatine is approximately 120-140 grams, of which approximately 95% is stored in muscle (46799). Creatine nitrate has been claimed to produce higher intramuscular concentrations of creatine at a lower dose than creatine monohydrate, but clinical evidence does not support this claim (95959, 102167). Although a small study in healthy adults shows that taking creatine nitrate 3 grams daily for 5 days increases muscle creatine levels to a slightly greater degree than taking creatine monohydrate at the same dose (102167), longer-term research does not agree. Another study shows that taking creatine nitrate 12 grams daily for 7 days followed by 3 grams daily for 21 days results in lower muscle creatine levels when compared with taking creatine monohydrate at the same dose and duration (95959).\n\nCreatine is also found in the liver, kidney, sperm, brain, eyes, and nerves. The daily turnover is approximately 2 grams (4574, 11330). Normal creatine plasma levels are 50-100 mcmol/L (2103) while the levels are about 25 mcmol/L in vegetarians (46781). About 1.5% to 2% of the body creatine pool is converted to creatinine daily (46530).\nMetabolism\nCreatine is metabolized to creatinine slowly, with no significant conversion during the first six hours (46512).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of creatine in the body is 29-35 days (46833). Muscle total creatine levels have been reported to decline at a rate of 0.43-0.68 mmol/kg of dry mass daily (2104, 4582, 4606). Creatine is excreted renally, with 40% excreted within 10 hours of administration and excretion increased from 1.1 to 1.2 grams per 24 hours (46512).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCreatine is concentrated primarily in skeletal muscle (95%), but is also found in heart, brain, testes, retina, and other tissues (3997, 3998). The body synthesizes 1 to 2 grams of creatine a day from dietary amino acids (2103). This primarily takes place in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas (3997). Synthesis begins in the kidney when the precursors arginine and glycine form guanidoacetic acid. This product is methylated in the liver, forming creatine, technically known as methylguanidine-acetic acid. Creatine is transported through the blood to muscles, where it is highly concentrated as phosphocreatine. Dietary sources, such as fish and meats, supply an additional 1 to 2 grams (2103, 6061). Creatine in skeletal muscles exists in dynamic equilibrium with phosphocreatine (3997). Body stores of phosphocreatine in skeletal muscle serve as a precursor to the energy molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Higher levels of creatine are thought to enhance the ability to renew ATP for short 10-20 second energy bursts and improve resynthesis of phosphocreatine during recovery from intense exercise. Creatine supplementation enhances both creatine and phosphocreatine concentrations, providing a larger total creatine pool in the skeletal muscle. Creatine hinders the creatine-creatine kinase-phosphocreatine circuit. However, there is some debate about whether increased phosphocreatine resynthesis actually occurs (2103, 3997, 4574, 4576, 4580, 4583, 6925, 6927, 11330, 112205, 112218).\nAntidiabetes effects\nDecreased blood glucose and serum insulin levels in creatine-supplemented animals have been reported (46809). Also, some clinical evidence shows that creatine supplementation leads to an increase in AMPK-alpha protein (46768). AMPK-alpha protein content has been reportedly related to a change in GLUT-4 translocation and HbA1 c levels, suggesting beneficial effects of creatine supplementation on glucose uptake. However, in humans, short-term creatine supplementation does not appear to influence glucose tolerance, glucose levels, or insulin sensitivity (46522, 46588, 46656).\nAntiepileptic effects\nIn vivo, a mutation in the X-linked cerebral creatine transporter (SLC6A8) gene has been reported to lead to a decrease in cerebral creatine levels (46747). Creatine monohydrate has been reported to enhance cerebral creatine transport, and when combined with L-arginine and L-glycine, it enhanced cerebral creatine synthesis, leading to a complete resolution of seizures.\nAntineoplastic effects\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding the association between creatine intake and cancer. Some research shows that creatine and its analogs, such as cyclocreatine, inhibit tumor growth (1393, 1406, 1432, 1481). Addition of creatine and phosphocreatine analogs to the MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma and the HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cell lines delayed the growth of rat mammary adenocarcinomas comparably to effects seen with currently used anticancer drugs (1432). Further, creatine might alter energy production by the creatine kinase system, which appears to play a role in controlling some types of tumors such as breast tumors and neuroblastomas (1393, 1406). Nude mice transplanted with human colon adenocarcinoma cells given creatine demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor growth; the growth inhibition was directly correlated with creatine tissue concentrations (46824). Cyclocreatine, an analog of creatine, was effective when added to standard anticancer agents, including cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, or 5-fluorouracil, and resulted in tumor-growth delay in SW2 small-cell lung cancer cells compared with those obtained for each of the drugs alone (46789) and when administered to rats with mammary carcinoma (46809). However, other research shows that creatine or its metabolites can form mutagenic substances when combined at room temperature with sugars or heated (1486, 1487). Furthermore, population research shows that use of muscle building supplements (creatine, protein, and androstenedione) is associated with an increased odds of testicular germ cell cancer. This risk appears to be more apparent in early users, those using two or more muscle building supplements, and with long-term use. The odds of testicular germ cell cancer may be increased by up to 155% in males taking both creatine and protein supplements (90329). The risk of testicular germ cell cancer from creatine alone is unclear from this study.\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary in vitro and clinical research shows that creatine reduces serum markers of oxidative stress when compared with control (46746, 46775, 112218). Other clinical research shows that malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) excretion are significantly increased with creatine, which might suggest reduced oxidative DNA damage and lipid per oxidation (46764).\nAthletic performance enhancement effects\nMyocytes use creatine to make phosphocreatine (PCr) via the enzyme creatine kinase (CK). PCr is used to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). PCr also buffers intracellular hydrogen ions associated with lactate production and muscle fatigue during exercise. Thus, creatine may increase both the force of muscle contraction (by boosting ATP levels) and the duration of anaerobic exercise. During the first 10 seconds of intense exercise, creatine levels are markedly depleted (46786).\n\nMultiple studies show that taking creatine supplements increases muscle creatine content (2103, 3997, 4574, 4576, 4580, 4583, 6925, 6927, 11330, 112205). Creatine may allow athletes to train harder due to increased phosphocreatine resynthesis and subsequent energy production (6061). In vitro research shows that creatine supplementation may accelerate PCr resynthesis following intense muscle contractions (46847).\n\nCreatine might also reduce lactate production (4604, 108333); however, this has not been consistently found in studies (4592). Some evidence from animal research shows that creatine increases the expression of GLUT-4, a gene involved in the uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle cells, which helps maintain normoglycemia during exercise (46531, 46586, 46636). However, conflicting evidence exists (46608). Ingesting creatine monohydrate has been shown to increase the maximal accumulated oxygen deficit, which may be responsible for its ergogenic effect on supramaximal exercise performance (46799).\nBody mass\nPreliminary research shows creatine might increase the activity of muscle precursor cells called satellite cells, causing muscular hypertrophy (13773). However, most clinical evidence supports increased cellular water retention as the primary cause of creatine-induced muscle gain (4569, 4575, 4576, 4579, 4588, 6061, 10062, 95962, 95964). This increased cellular water retention does not induce proportional increases in body weight (95962). The muscle enlargement due to increased water retention is short-term compared to the muscle enlargement from strength training, which results in an increase in contractile and structural muscle proteins (6052).\n\nA meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in generally healthy adults shows that taking creatine 5-20 grams orally daily for up to 48 weeks increases lean body mass by less than 1 kg when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses show that increases in lean body mass are modestly larger when combined with resistance exercises (112201).\n\nSome preliminary clinical research suggests that taking creatine modestly reduces fat mass; however, research is inconsistent and the mechanism of action is unclear. In some types of adipose tissue in vitro, creatine seems to stimulate mitochondrial ATP turnover, possibly increasing its metabolic rate. Laboratory research also suggests that a decrease in creatine synthesis in adipose tissue results in increased fat accumulation (108335).\nBone density effects\nCreatine is thought to benefit bone by increasing muscle mass, which results in greater bone pull during training, and increased bone density (104673). In elderly individuals, increased muscle mass during training correlates with increased bone mineral content (46664). In vitro, creatine stimulates the differentiation of osteoblasts and in human research, creatine reduces markers of bone resorption (45596, 46709, 104673). However, most clinical research suggests that creatine does not improve bone density with aging (46664, 90321, 95969, 102168, 104671, 104673, 104674).\nCardiovascular effects\nCreatine phosphate appears to improve CHF by preserving intracellular high-energy phosphates in the myocardium, stabilizing the sarcolemma, preventing peroxidative damage, and improving microcirculation (1369). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that creatine supplementation (15.75 grams daily for five days, then 5.25 grams daily for 20 days) results in reduced cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and ratio of cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (46846). Other clinical research shows that creatine supplementation decreases triacylglyceride levels by 26% and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels by 26% (4573). However, in other clinical research, creatine had no effect on these lipid parameters (46518, 95959). Also, creatine does not appear to affect homocysteine levels in healthy individuals (46540).\nHyperornithemia effect\nIn human research, creatine content in untreated gyrate atrophy patients was significantly reduced, and supplementation improved levels dramatically (4577, 46509). Supplemental creatine also increased myofibrillar protein synthesis resulting in muscle accretion in patients with gyrate atrophy (4576, 4587).In a separate study, creatine supplementation was found to increase type 2 muscle fibers and improve visual field tests (4578).\nMultiple sclerosis\nElevated creatine in white matter of individuals with multiple sclerosis has been suggested as reflecting microscopic inflammation, gliosis, or de- and remyelination (42241). Results from one small randomized, double-blind clinical trial show that creatine supplementation does not improve work production in individuals with multiple sclerosis (46599).\nNeuromuscular disorder effects\nThere is some evidence that patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have elevated cytosolic concentrations of calcium in dystrophic skeletal muscle cells. In vitro evidence shows that creatine can attenuate elevated calcium levels by stimulating sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, a transporter protein that regulates the amount of calcium in cells (46822).\n\nG93A transgenic mice have significant mitochondrial dysfunction similar to that observed in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Evidence from animal research shows that oral administration of creatine to these mice leads to dose-dependent improvement in motor performance and extended survival (4566, 43914). However, clinical evidence shows that creatine supplementation does not offer benefit to individuals with ALS (11332, 16389, 46574).\n\nIn myophosphorylase deficiency, known as McArdle disease, a rare genetic metabolic disease in which ATP cannot be formed from glycogen in skeletal muscle, supplemental creatine is thought to serve as a source of energy (70).\nNeuroprotective effects\nIn newborn rats, hypoxia-induced seizures were reduced by creatine injections (46816). In a similar study, chronic administration of creatine ameliorated the extent of cortical damage by as much as 36% in mice and 50% in rats (46526). After taking a creatine supplement (8 grams daily for five days), repeated performance of simple mathematical calculations decreased cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin in the brains of subjects, suggesting increased oxygen utilization (46571).\n\nIn patients with schizophrenia, there is thought to be altered brain mitochondrial energy metabolism and reduced adenosine triphosphate levels in the frontal and left temporal lobes. Creatine supplementation may help increase adenosine triphosphate levels (16390).\n\nIn patients with Huntington disease, striatal cells may become more susceptible to the excitatory effects of glutamate, which can cause the nerve cells to become damaged. In human research, creatine supplementation lowered levels of glutamate in the brain of patients with Huntington disease (46644). However, other clinical evidence shows that creatine supplementation does not benefit patients with Huntington disease (46598, 46609).\n\nAdministration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) can cause parkinsonian syndrome. This neurotoxicity results from the metabolism of MPTP to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) by monoamine oxidase B. Evidence from animal research shows that creatine supplementation can attenuate MPTP-induced neurotoxicity (4568). It is unclear if creatine would have similar neuroprotective effects against neurodegeneration in patients with Parkinson disease.\nStrength-enhancing effects\nAlthough conflicting evidence exists, some clinical research shows that creatine supplementation can increase strength (6928, 10062, 46550, 46561, 46565, 46801, 46843). Some evidence shows that increased strength may result from increased muscle growth (46551, 46652, 104670). Clinical evidence suggests that an increased muscle mass is associated with an increase in intracellular water. However, creatine supplementation does not seem to affect the ratio of intracellular water to muscle mass (104670). Preliminary clinical evidence shows that supplementation with creatine increases the expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-II in muscle cells. IGF-I and IGF-II are involved in the synthesis and regeneration of muscle proteins. By increasing the expression of IGF-I and IGF-II, creatine may stimulate muscle growth (46652). Other preliminary clinical evidence shows that creatine supplementation can stimulate the expression of type 1, 2a, and 2x myosin heavy-chain mRNA (46551). Increased synthesis of myosin heavy-chains could increase muscle strength and size. A meta-analysis of small randomized controlled trials in adults undergoing resistance training shows that taking creatine 5-20 grams orally daily for 6-52 weeks very modestly increases upper and lower body skeletal muscle hypertrophy when compared with placebo (112217).\n\nThere is also interest in using creatine to aid in muscle growth and recovery after a stroke (112209). Very early research suggests that taking creatine along with progressive resistance training after a stroke improves walking capacity when compared with placebo (112207)."

Cucumber contains the iminosugar, ido-BR1. Ido-BR1 is a polyhydroxylated pipecolic acid also known as (2R,3R,4R,5S)-3,4,5 trihydroxypiperidine-2-carboxylic acid (103394). The fruit also contains glycosides, phytosterols, flavonoids, carbohydrates, terpenoids such as cucurbitacins, tannins, fatty acids, and the lignan secoisolariciresinol (103382, 110620). The main fatty acids in the seed oil are linoleic and oleic acids. The seed also contains phytosterols, saponins, and flavonoids (103386, 103395). Sphingolipids have been identified in the stem (103392).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nCucumber is traditionally used for diabetes. In animal diabetic models, cucumber seed extracts have been shown to reduce fasting blood glucose levels (103391). Other animal research in rats with chemically-induced diabetes shows that taking cucumber extract 200-400 mg/kg daily for 21 days lowers blood glucose levels and improves markers of diabetes-induce liver damage, such as liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase levels, when compared with control (110620).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCucumber extract has been shown to reduce pain in individuals with osteoarthritis. The mechanism of action is thought to be related to the iminosugar Ido-BR1. In laboratory research, this compound reduces the production and activity of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and inhibits the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (103385). In addition, amino acid-containing fractions of aqueous cucumber extract had anti-inflammatory effects in adipocytes in vitro (103388).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant activity of cucumber might be at least partially responsible for some of its potential clinical effects. In elderly adults, taking cucumber powder for 30 days increased activity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase in the blood. In addition, levels of antioxidants, including ascorbic acid and phenolics, were increased. Despite these changes, there was no effect on levels of reduced glutathione, vitamin E, malondialdehyde, or oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or on the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase (103387).\nHypolipidemic effects\nCucumber seed extract had hypolipidemic effects in human research. This might be due to the high levels of the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid, or the presence of phytosterols, in the seed oil (103386).\nWound healing effects\nCucumber is traditionally used as a poultice for wound and burn healing. An isolated proteolytic serine glycoprotein from cucumber has hemostatic effects in human plasma in vitro. In addition, it hydrolyses a partially cross-linked fibrin clot. These activities are important in wound healing (103389)."

It is unclear if oral cumin is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes show that taking cumin essential oil 25-100 mg by mouth daily for 8-12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum insulin, and diabetes-associated inflammatory markers when compared with placebo (111368, 111370).\n\nHowever, meta-analyses of studies in patients with and without type 2 diabetes show conflicting results. One analysis of seven clinical trials shows that taking cumin essential oil 25-300 mg daily for up to 24 weeks does not improve fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, or other markers of glycemic control when compared with a control group (106516). Another meta-analysis evaluating eight clinical trials, including all seven assessed in the previous analysis, shows that cumin essential oil has a large effect on both fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c when compared with control (106517). These discrepant findings may be due to the inclusion of an additional trial in the second analysis or different methods for pooling study results.\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral cumin is beneficial in patients with dyslipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of six clinical trials including 376 individuals with or without hyperlipidemia shows that taking cumin reduces levels of total cholesterol by around 11 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 7 mg/dL when compared with control or placebo. Cumin also increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by around 3 mg/dL, but does not affect triglyceride levels. A sub-analysis of dosages and dosage forms shows that cumin essential oil 25-100 mg daily or cumin powder 3 grams daily were beneficial, while lower doses of the powder or essential oil and all doses of cumin extract did not affect lipid levels. Patients included in the available research were either overweight or obese or had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (100162). It is not clear what effect, if any, cumin has in patients with diagnosed dyslipidemia.\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral cumin extract or essential oil does not seem to reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, although it may improve other lipid parameters.\nA meta-analysis of two small clinical trials in adults with either type 2 diabetes or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who also have hypertriglyceridemia shows that taking cumin extract 225 mg daily for 6 months or cumin essential oil 25 mg daily for 3 months modestly reduces levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and modestly increases levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo. However, taking cumin does not improve triglyceride levels (100162).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral cumin is beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nA small clinical trial in adults with prediabetes shows that taking cumin essential oil 75 mg daily for 10 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), or measures of insulin resistance but does seem to reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (111369).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

The effect of cumin was similar to that of orlistat 120 mg three times daily. Cumin, but not orlistat, improved plasma insulin levels and insulin sensitivity; however, it did not affect insulin resistance, thyroid function, or plasma glucose or lipid levels (100160). Another small clinical study in overweight or obese females shows that taking cumin powder 1.5 grams in 150 mL of low-fat yogurt twice daily with meals as part of a calorie-restrictive diet for 3 months increases weight loss by an additional 2 kg when compared with yogurt and a calorie-restrictive diet alone.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of cumin is the fruit or seed. Cumin seeds contain phytosterols, glycoside saponins, sesquiterpenoid glucosides, flavonoids, and genistein (32482, 32485, 39867, 46861, 46866, 46901, 100160, 100161). The essential oil extracted from cumin seed contains monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and related compounds including cuminaldehyde, para-cymene, gamma-terpinene, and beta-pinene (6, 39799, 46860, 100160, 100163).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCumin is of interest for the treatment of metabolic syndrome. However, in clinical research in patients with metabolic syndrome, cumin essential oil did not reduce most oxidative or inflammatory indices, although there was a small effect on antioxidant status and superoxide dismutase activity (100163). In vitro, cumin essential oil has demonstrated some effects on inflammatory mediators (100163).\nAntimicrobial effects\nCumin essential oil and the constituent cuminaldehyde have been reported to exhibit antibacterial and antifungal activity (6, 30663, 36131, 39779, 39881, 46171, 46870, 46882).\nHypoglycemic effects\nCumin is of interest for the treatment of diabetes, and animal research suggests that cumin may have hypoglycemic effects, but high-quality clinical research in patients with diabetes is lacking (46857, 46895, 100160, 111367). The antihyperglycemic and hypoglycemic effects of cumin demonstrated in animal research are thought to be due to various cumin constituents, including flavonoids, zinc, manganese, cuminaldehyde, and cuminol, which may increase insulin secretion (46189, 111367, 111370). Cuminaldehyde may also inhibit aldose reductase and alpha-glucosidase, enzymes implicated in diabetes progression (111370).\nHypolipemic effects\nSome research in humans and animals suggests that cumin might help to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels, although the evidence is mixed (100160, 100161, 100162, 111370). Potential active constituents include the glycoside saponins, phytosterols, and flavonoids, which possibly reduce cholesterol absorption and increase fecal excretion of cholesterol (100161, 111370). Cumin also increases paraoxonase 1 and apolipoprotein A1, enzymes implicated in lipid metabolism (111370).\nInsecticidal effects\nCumin essential oil and the constituent cuminaldehyde have been reported to exhibit strong larvicidal effects (6, 39803).\nPhototoxic effects\nCumin essential oil has been reported to cause marked phototoxic effects. However, these effects are reportedly not due to the cuminaldehyde constituent (11)."

In rats, pretreatment with an ethanolic extract of cypress leaf attenuated indomethacin-induced gastric tissue damage.

In vitro and animal research shows that cypress fruit extract inhibits the proliferation of benign prostate hyperplasia stromal cells and causes stromal cell apoptosis. Cypress extract also decreases stromal cells in cultured human benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue.
