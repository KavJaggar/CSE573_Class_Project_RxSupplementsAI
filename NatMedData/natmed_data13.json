            "Overview": "The name \"labdanum\" refers to the byproducts of the above ground parts of two closely related plants, Cistus ladanifer and Cistus creticus (98403). These plants are perennial shrubs ranging from 1 to 5 feet in height that thrive in hot, dry, hilly areas. They are native to the Mediterranean regions of Southern Europe and North Africa (11, 98402, 98412). The term \"labdanum\" is primarily applied to the sticky, aromatic resin secreted by the leaves and stems of these plants (98403).",

Labdanum oleoresin contains volatile oils, paraffins, and resins, consisting of acids and neutral labdane compounds (11). Labdanum essential oil contains pinenes, camphene, sabinene, myrcene, limonene, p-cymene, alpha-phellandrene, terminenes, 1,8-cineole, borneol, nerol, linalool, geraniol, eugenol, fenchone, alpha-thujone, isomenthone, acetophenone, ledol, diacetyl, benzaldehyde, citrals, geranyl acetate, and fatty acids (11).\n\nAn aqueous extract of labdanum contains hexahydroxydiphenoyl; flavonoids, including quercetin, kaempferol, and apigenin; phenolic acids, including quinic, shikimic, gallic, and ellagic acids; and antioxidant polyphenols such as epigallocatechin (98403).\n\nMethanolic extracts of labdanum (specifically Cistus incanus) aerial parts contain the flavonol myricetin and its derivatives (myricitrin, myricetin, myricitrine pentoside) as well as the catechin derivatives epigallocatechin, gallocatechin, and epicatechin. Methanolic extracts of labdanum (specifically Cistus ladanifer) aerial parts contain mostly kaempferol glycosides and the phenolic acids gallic acid and egallic acid with a noticeably lower concentration of flavonol derivatives (106532).\nAnalgesic effects\nIn rats, an aqueous extract of labdanum leaves (specifically Cistus ladanifer), given intraperitoneally in a dose of 150-200 mg/kg, has central analgesic activity in the hot-plate test (98404).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn rats, an aqueous extract of labdanum leaves (specifically Cistus ladanifer), given intraperitoneally in a dose of 150-200 mg/kg, has anti-inflammatory activity against paw edema induced by carrageenan (98404).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro, methanolic extracts of labdanum (specifically Cistus incanus and Cistus ladanifer) aerial parts have demonstrated cytotoxicity against human malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (106532).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, methanolic extracts of labdanum (specifically Cistus incanus and Cistus ladanifer) aerial parts have demonstrated antioxidant activity (106532).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, aqueous extracts of labdanum (specifically Cistus creticus) can protect cells from infection with human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) types 1 and 2, Ebola virus, and Marburg virus. It is thought that several compounds in the extracts target viral envelope proteins, preventing attachment of the virus to host cells. Resistance does not develop in HIV-1 when cell cultures are exposed to the labdanum extracts continuously for 24 weeks and repeatedly challenged with the virus (98401, 98402).\n\nA specific, polyphenol-rich extract of labdanum (Cystus052, Dr. Pandalis Urheimische Medizin GMBH & Co.) inhibits replication of influenza A virus in cell cultures when it is applied before, or at the same time, as the virus. Polyphenols in the extract bind to the virus surface and prevent it from binding to cells (98410). The Cystus052 extract also protects mice from an avian influenza virus when administered as an aerosol, starting 10 minutes before exposure to the nebulized virus (98409).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn rats, an aqueous extract of labdanum (specifically Cistus creticus) given orally in a dose of 0.25-0.5 gram/kg, has protective effects against gastric ulcers caused by 1N hydrochloric acid, absolute ethanol, indomethacin, serotonin, and reserpine (4050).\nSkeletal muscle effects\nIn rabbits, the flavonoid constituents of Cistus ladanifer resin exudate, apigenin and 3,7-di-O-methyl-kaempferol, inhibit the calcium-ATPase pump in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit skeletal muscle. This decreases ATP-dependent calcium accumulation and impairs muscle relaxation (98405).\nSkin effects\nIn vitro, methanolic extracts of labdanum (specifically Cistus incanus and Cistus ladanifer) aerial parts have demonstrated tyrosinase inhibitory activity as well as sun protecting activity (106532)."

Many cases of poisoning involve children who ingest small quantities of seeds and experience primarily gastrointestinal symptoms, with a relatively rapid recovery (101220, 101221, 101222). Symptoms of more severe laburnum poisoning include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, excessive salivation, and pain in the mouth, throat, and stomach. This can be accompanied by sweating, headaches, hypertension, tachycardia, tremors, weakness, and incoordination (101220, 101221, 101222). After ingestion of high doses, a later, delayed phase of poisoning can cause hypotension, bradycardia, dyspnea, coma, respiratory failure, and death (101221).\nCardiovascular\nIn the early phases of severe laburnum poisoning, hypertension and tachycardia occur, along with constriction of peripheral blood vessels leading to coldness in the limbs (101220, 101221).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of laburnum is the seed (18). Laburnum contains quinolizidine alkaloids and lectins (18). All parts of the plant contain the toxic quinolizidine alkaloids cytisine and N-methylcytisine, although these constituents are most concentrated in the seeds. These alkaloids have nicotine-like effects on the cholinergic nervous system (101220, 101221).\nToxic effects\nThe toxic alkaloid cytisine is an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (101221). The early symptoms of laburnum poisoning, such as abdominal pain, increased salivation, dilated pupils, and tremors, are due to cholinergic stimulation. This leads to increased sodium ion influx, prolonged membrane depolarization, and enhanced action potential propagation. Increased postganglionic transmission and catecholamine release cause tachycardia and hypertension. Discharges directly from the spinal cord cause muscle fasciculations and tremor. After high doses or prolonged exposure, autonomic ganglion blockade can occur, resulting in hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression (101221)."

Another small clinical study in patients with melasma shows that use of a solution containing lactic acid, salicylic acid, citric acid, and ethanol followed by trichloroacetic acid 20% every 2 weeks for 8 sessions improves melasma area and severity when compared with baseline, but is similarly effective to a facial peel containing glycolic acid 70% followed by trichloroacetic acid (108409).\nless\nOnychomycosis. Topical lactic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with distal subungual onychomycosis affecting up to 75% of fingernails or toenails shows that topical application with a specific product (K101) containing lactic acid, urea, and propylene glycol daily for 24 weeks results in mycological cure in 27% of patients, compared with 10% of those using placebo. There was also an increase in the percentage of patients with negative fungal culture.

However, after a total of 8 weeks, including a maintenance phase of three weekly treatments for 4 weeks, there do not appear to be benefits when compared with placebo (92210). It is unclear if this effect is due to lactic acid, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if intravaginal lactic acid is beneficial for UTI prevention.\nObservational research in patients with frequent UTIs suggests that intravaginal application of a gel containing lactic acid (KadeFungin, Milchsäurekur) for 2-3 days monthly for 4 months might be associated with a reduced odds of UTI recurrence. There was no UTI symptom recurrence in 63.5% of patients over this time period (108169). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group and the observational nature of the study.\nless\nWarts. Topical lactic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adolescents and young adults with warts shows that topical application with lactic acid 15% and salicylic acid 15% ointment twice daily for up to 3 months is equally effective to zinc oxide 20% ointment for wart resolution and/or improvement (108170).\nless\nWater warts. Topical lactic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children aged 2-12 years with water warts shows that a specific solution (Duoderm solution, ORVA Pharmaceuticals) containing lactic acid 16.7% and salicylic acid 16.7%, applied daily for 6 weeks and washed and scraped off prior to the next application, is as effective for inducing remission of water warts as applying potassium hydroxide 10%.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLactic acid is a type of alpha hydroxy acid. Alpha hydroxy acids are a group of natural acids found in foods. For example, lactic acid is found in sour milk and tomato juice (6064, 10104, 92217, 108168).\nDermatological effects\nHyperkeratinization is thought to contribute to acne, dry skin, and photo-aging. Alpha hydroxy acids like lactic acid work by exfoliating the top layers of dead skin cells (948, 950, 6064, 106612). Alpha hydroxy acids seem to improve the appearance of aging skin by increasing smoothness and reducing dark spots (6064). The degree of exfoliation is determined by the type, concentration, and pH of the alpha hydroxy acid, as well as the other ingredients in the product. The lower the pH of the alpha hydroxy acid, the more rapidly it is absorbed into the skin (106612). Alpha hydroxy acids that are small in molecular size per volume are more active and penetrate the skin more deeply than larger alpha hydroxy acids. Glycolic acid is smallest in molecular size followed by lactic, pyruvic, malic, tartaric, and citric acid (10102). Lactic acid solutions increase skin firmness by increasing the thickness of the epidermal and dermal layers. This effect is concentration-dependent; a 5% solution acts at the epidermal layer, while a 12% solution increases the thickness of both layers (8011).\n\nThe exfoliating action of alpha hydroxy acids reduces the thickness of the stratum corneum by diminishing corneocyte cohesion at the lower, newly forming levels, but not the mature upper levels, of the stratum corneum. This improves the flexibility of the stratum corneum and the skin surface. The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown. However, some researchers think alpha hydroxy acids interfere with the function of the enzymes involved in the formation of ionic sulfate and phosphate bonds in the stratum corneum (10104). There is concern that the barrier function of the stratum corneum may be reduced, but evidence suggests lactic acid slightly increases the barrier function of the stratum corneum (951).\n\nLactic acid is also of interest for wound healing. Lactic acid seems to increase the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which plays a role in angiogenesis and wound healing (108168)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Lacticaseibacillus casei is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, homofermentive, anaerobic bacteria. L. casei is found in infant feces and the nasopharynx. Specific strains of L. casei are found as probiotics in supplements and functional foods. Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605, 101513).",
            "Warnings": "In April 2020, the genus Lactobacillus was reclassified into 25 different genera (101513). L. casei, which was previously classified under the Lactobacillus genus, was reclassified under the Lacticaseibacillus genus. However, some product labels may still identify this species as Lactobacillus casei. Some probiotics previously considered to be strains of L. casei have been reclassified to Lacticaseibacillus paracasei. These include L. paracasei strains Shirota, L. paracasei CNCM I-1572 (L. casei DG), L. paracasei DN-114 011, and others. Some of these strains continue to be marketed and referred to in publications as L. casei (105133, 111956, 112515). See the Lacticaseibacillus paracasei monograph for updates related to these strains. Publications related to L. casei strains for which no further details are provided and/or information regarding reclassification is limited, remain in this monograph.\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using L. casei for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, L. casei is not specifically recommended for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Lacticaseibacillus casei has been safely used alone or in combination with other ingredients in studies lasting up to 8 weeks (90230, 112517).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children of most ages. Lacticaseibacillus casei has been safely used alone in studies lasting up to 4 months (14373, 107544). Also, a specific mixture (Latopic, Biomed S.A.) providing 1 billion CFUs of L. casei ŁOCK 0919 50%, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus ŁOCK 0900 25%, and L. rhamnosus ŁOCK 0908 25% has been used with apparent safety for 3 months in children under 2 years of age (107510). In addition, in children ages 4-17 years, a 1:1:1 combination of L. casei CECT 9104, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CECT 8145, and Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 providing 1 billion CFUs has been used with apparent safety for 12 weeks (107531). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of L. casei in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. A combination of Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum has been used with apparent safety for 6 weeks, starting at 24-28 weeks' gestation (95416, 98430).\nLACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Lacticaseibacillus casei during lactation. However, there are currently no reasons to expect safety concerns when used appropriately.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Lacticaseibacillus casei is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Mild gastrointestinal adverse effects.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There is concern that lactobacilli may cause infections in some people.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, taking Lacticaseibacillus casei in combination with other probiotics may cause gastrointestinal side effects including abdominal pain (90291); however, these events are uncommon.\nless\nImmunologic\nSince Lacticaseibacillus casei preparations contain live and active microorganisms, there is some concern that they might cause pathogenic infection in some patients. Some lactobacilli species have been isolated in some cases of bacteremia, sepsis, splenic abscess, endocarditis, aortic dissection, necrotizing fasciitis, pancreatic necrosis, and meningoencephalitis. Most of these cases are thought to be due to the translocation of bacteria from other locations in the body in which they occur naturally, such as the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. The majority of cases are not related to the use of probiotic supplements and most are not associated with the use of L. casei (107543, 112516). There is at least one case of L. casei bacteremia and endocarditis thought to be related with L. casei intake in a 71-year-old immunocompromised female (112520).\n\nThere are two cases of L. casei infection in a prosthetic joint (90282, 112514). In one case, the 95-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease was known to consume yogurt containing L. casei. However, it was not confirmed that the infection was related to the consumption of this product. Spread from the gastrointestinal tract or vaginal flora could not be ruled out (90282). In the case of an 80-year-old male, the cause was unknown as there was no probiotic supplementation and no underlying medical condition or infectious portal of entry (112514).\n\nA specific probiotic preparation (NBL probiotic ATP, Nobel) containing L. casei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, colostrum, and lactoferrin was found to be a significant risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus colonization in premature infants. Although there was no direct link to determine causation, it was hypothesized that the probiotic mixture helped to mediate the acquisition and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (96890).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Oral Lacticaseibacillus casei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific L. casei-containing combination product (Bio-K+ CI1285) may be beneficial for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This combination product provides L. casei LBC80R, Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus CLR2 as 100 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily (25494, 95402, 95403) However, taking L. casei might not help with the treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Clinical research in hospitalized patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea shows that taking a combination of L. casei 20 million CFUs and Bifidobacterium breve 50 million CFUs 3 times daily does not reduce the average duration of diarrhea, the frequency of healing, or relapse rates, when compared with taking placebo (111006).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral Lacticaseibacillus casei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn children under two years of age with atopic dermatitis who are on a cow's milk protein elimination diet, clinical research shows that taking a specific mixture (Latopic, Biomed S.A.) providing 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of L. casei ôOCK 0919 50%, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus ŁOCK 0900 25%, and L. rhamnosus ôOCK 0908 25% for 3 months increases the odds of a 30% or greater improvement in symptom scores by about 2.6-fold when compared with placebo. However, there was no difference in the absolute symptom scores between groups. Beneficial effects of this combination were greater in children confirmed to have allergen sensitization (107510). Other clinical research in children ages 4-17 years shows that taking 1 billion CFUs of a 1:1:1 combination of L. casei CECT 9104, Bifidobacterium lactis CECT 8145, and Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 for 12 weeks modestly reduces symptom severity and the need for topical corticosteroids when compared with placebo (107531).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus casei for cancer prevention or treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. casei for this condition.\nConstipation. Oral Lacticaseibacillus casei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nCombinations of probiotics containing L. casei appear to increase stool frequency and improve symptoms of functional constipation in adults. These combinations include Hexbio, containing L. casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis 30 billion CFUs twice daily for 7 days (90266), and ID-HWS1000, containing L. casei IDCC 3451, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum IDCC 3501, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus IDCC 3201, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis IDCC 4301, Bifidobacterium breve IDCC 4401, Lactococcus lactis IDCC 2301, xylooligosaccharide, and dietary fiber as nondigestible maltodextrin, oat fiber, and psyllium husk fiber (107517).\nless\nDepression. Oral Lacticaseibacillus casei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with major depression shows that taking L. casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum daily for 8 weeks reduces symptoms of depression measured on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) when compared with placebo (99780). However, the validity of the results from this study is limited by incomplete reporting. For example, patient baseline BDI scores were not reported.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus casei is beneficial for treatment of type 2 or gestational diabetes.\nIn patients with gestational diabetes, clinical research shows that taking a combination of freeze-dried L. casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum each as 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram daily for 6 weeks improves fasting blood glucose levels and glycemic control when compared with placebo (95416, 98430). Furthermore, a sub-analysis of a meta-analysis of clinical research investigating the effects of L. casei as part of multi-ingredient probiotic and prebiotic products shows that taking products containing L. casei modestly reduces fasting insulin levels and improves insulin resistance in this population. There were also modest reductions in triglyceride levels; however, the effects on fasting blood glucose were not significant (111796). It is unclear from these studies if any beneficial effects are related to L. casei, L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, or the combination.\n\nLimited evidence from mainly small clinical trials has also assessed the effects of L. casei for type 2 diabetes. In one study, taking L. casei 100 million CFUs daily for 8 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by about 28 mg/dL when compared with placebo. There was no effect on glycated hemoglobin; however, the duration was inadequate to demonstrate an effect (99786). In another study, taking a specific product (Familact) containing L. casei and six other probiotic strains daily for 6 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose, but does not affect plasma insulin, when compared with placebo (99790).\nless\nDiarrhea. Oral Lacticaseibacillus casei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children with dysentery being treated with ceftriaxone shows that taking a specific combination probiotic sachet (Kidilact, Zisttakhmir Company) containing L. casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium breve, and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 5 days modestly reduces the duration of diarrhea, hospitalization, and blood in diarrhea when compared with control (102417). Although The European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388), both guidelines note that most evidence is low quality.\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus casei is beneficial for H. pylori eradication in adults or children.\nClinical research in adults shows that taking L. casei along with six other probiotics in conjunction with bismuth quadruple therapy does not seem to improve H. pylori eradication rates when compared with placebo and bismuth quadruple therapy (90291). Also, taking a combination of L. casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus without any standard H. pylori therapies does not improve H. pylori eradication rates (12766). However, a clinical study in children shows that taking a fermented milk product containing L. casei DN-114 001 for 14 days along with triple therapy comprised of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 7 days improves the H. pylori eradication rate to approximately 85%, compared with 61% of those given triple therapy alone (107544).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus casei for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lactobacillus for this condition.\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus casei is beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nIn patients with primary hyperlipidemia, clinical research shows that taking L. casei 200 million colony-forming units in combination with red yeast rice twice daily for 8 weeks does not have beneficial effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglyceride levels, when compared with taking red yeast rice alone. Taking L. casei seems to modestly reduce diastolic blood pressure in this population; however, it is unclear if these changes are clinically significant (112517).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus casei is beneficial for lowering blood pressure.\nA meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials shows that taking various species of lactobacilli as 100 million to 1.5 trillion colony-forming units daily for 3-24 weeks reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg and 1.5 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo in various populations. However, sub-group analyses of three clinical trials show that these benefits do not occur in clinical research investigating the effects of L. casei, specifically (105135).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral Lacticaseibacillus casei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS shows that taking a specific multi-species probiotic (NordBiotic, MBM Biotix) containing L. casei LC130, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR110, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LPC100, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA120, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LP140, Bifidobacterium breve BB010, Bifidobacterium longum BL020, Bifidobacterium bifidum BF030, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL040, and Streptococcus thermophilus ST250 as 2.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) total twice daily for 8 weeks improves overall symptom severity, as well as pain severity, pain frequency, and quality of life, when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was rated as mild by approximately 60% of those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 30% of those taking placebo (107516). However, clinical research shows that taking another multi-species combination of L. casei LBC80R, L. acidophilus CL1285, and L. rhamnosus CLR2 50 billion CFUs each daily for 3 months does not improve symptoms in patients with IBS when compared with placebo (99789).\nless\nLyme disease. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus casei for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lactobacillus for this condition.\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus casei is beneficial or safe for NEC prevention.\nMost meta-analyses of clinical research show that giving lactobacilli enterally reduces the risk of NEC and/or severe NEC in preterm, mainly very low birth weight (VLBW), infants. Some meta-analyses support the use of lactobacilli in combination with bifidobacteria, as opposed to lactobacilli alone for reducing the risk of NEC. However, the effects of L. casei specifically are unclear (95344, 95351, 103437, 103445, 104157, 105162, 105164). Also, guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies with respect to the use of probiotics in very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in this group of infants (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608). The Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that probiotic combinations may be of benefit in reducing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates over 1000 grams. However, L. casei is not specifically recommended (103003, 111609, 111611).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral Lacticaseibacillus casei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in adults with NAFLD shows that taking a combination of L. casei BCMC 12,313, Lactobacillus acidophilus BCMC 12,130, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BCMC 12,451, Bifidobacterium bifidum BCMC 02290, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis BCMC 02129, and Bifidobacterium longum BCMC 02120 as 30 billion colony-forming units twice daily for 6 months has no beneficial effects on hepatic steatosis or fibrosis or on levels of liver enzymes, blood lipids, or fasting blood glucose, when compared with placebo (107523).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral Lacticaseibacillus casei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with PCOS, clinical research shows that taking a combination of L. casei T2 (IBRC-M10783), Lactobacillus acidophilus T16 (IBRC-M10785), and Bifidobacterium bifidum T1 (IBRC-M10771) as 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each, plus inulin 800 mg, daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces serum insulin and triglyceride levels and improves insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo. However, it does not alter cholesterol or fasting blood glucose levels (105159). Clinical research also shows that 31.3% of patients with PCOS taking L. casei in combination with other probiotics daily for 6 months had regular menstrual cycles compared with 12.5% of those taking placebo. There were also modest improvements in testosterone levels and waist circumference, but not other hormones, insulin resistance, body weight, or most measures of quality of life. The product provided L. casei UBLC-42 1 billion CFUs, along with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UBLP-40, Lactobacillus acidophilus UBLA-34, Lacticaseibacillus casei UBLC-42, Limosilactobacillus fermentum UBLF-31, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus UBLR-58, Limosilactobacillus reuteri UBLRu-87, Bifidobacterium bifidum UBBB-55, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) daily for 2 months and then twice daily for 4 months. All patients also underwent dietary and lifestyle changes (110974).\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral Lacticaseibacillus casei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking probiotics during pregnancy reduces the severity and duration of nausea and vomiting by 16% to 54%. There was also a small benefit on stool hardness. A specific probiotic (Probiotics 10, Nature's Bounty) was taken as 2 capsules daily for two back-to-back cycles comprised of six days with probiotics and two days without. Each capsule contained a total of 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of L. casei Lc-11, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v and DSM 15312, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus Lb-87, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DSM 13434 and Lpc-37, Ligilactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-35, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04, along with inulin 200 mg (107199).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Small clinical studies suggest that taking Lacticaseibacillus casei might be beneficial for RA.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with RA show that taking L. casei 01 as 100 million colony-forming units daily for 8 weeks reduces tender and swollen joints and increases the number of patients who experience moderate symptom improvement when compared with placebo (90230, 90297). However, one small clinical study in patients with moderate-to-severe RA shows that taking capsules containing freeze-dried strains of L. casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum daily for 8 weeks does not reduce RA severity, the number of tender or swollen joints, or joint pain when compared with placebo (95418).\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea. It is unclear if Lacticaseibacillus casei is beneficial for rotaviral diarrhea.\nAlthough the World Gastroenterology Organization has not made a recommendation (98471), the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388). However, these guidelines note that most evidence is low quality and is not specific to rotavirus infection. Furthermore, these guidelines were released prior to the publication of the most recent, high-quality studies showing no benefit with the use of certain probiotics (98427, 98428). Research on the use of L. casei, specifically, for this purpose is lacking.\nless\nShort bowel syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus casei for short bowel syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. casei for this condition.\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus casei is beneficial for the treatment of SIBO.\nA small clinical study in children with chronic diarrhea due to SIBO shows that taking a combination of lyophilized L. casei 1.5 grams and Lactobacillus acidophilus 1.5 grams by mouth twice daily for 21 days decreases average daily stools by 1.5, but does not improve other symptoms, when compared with placebo (91143). Disparate study findings may be due to many factors, including differences in patient populations evaluated and use of different probiotic formulations.\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection. Some early research suggests that oral Lacticaseibacillus casei may be beneficial for preventing a first C. difficile infection. However, the quality of evidence is generally poor, and taking oral L. casei does not seem to be beneficial for the prevention of C. difficile recurrence.\nEvidence from clinical and observational research investigating the effect of L. casei on C. difficile occurrence or recurrence is weak. Most studies use this species in combination with one or more additional probiotic species, including a specific product (Bio-K+ Cl1285) providing L. casei LBC80R and Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285 and a specific product (Bio-K+ 50 Billion; Bio-K Plus International) providing L. casei LBC80R, L. acidophilus CL1285, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus CLR2 as 50 or 100 billion CFUs daily (25494, 90231, 90934, 95369, 95403, 107529). Observational research has found that providing a specific combination (Bio-K+ 50 Billion; Bio-K Plus International) of L. casei LBC80R, L. rhamnosus CLR2, and L. acidophilus CL1285 as 50-100 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 5 days to patients who are on antibiotics for at least 2 days reduces the hospital-wide incidence of C. difficile by approximately 40%. The incidence rate was decreased by at least 50% in the highest risk individuals taking this combination (107529).\n\nCurrent guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) state that there is insufficient information to recommend administration of probiotics for the primary prevention of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (107538).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Lacticaseibacillus casei for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nLacticaseibacillus casei has most often been used alone or in combination with other probiotics in doses of 100 million to 100 billion colony-forming units daily for up to 3 months.

Although endocarditis related to probiotic use is a rare cause of infective endocarditis, cases of endocarditis have been reported for patients with valvular heart disease who used similar probiotics before dental surgery, upper endoscopy, or colonoscopy (90254, 95393, 95407).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with Lacticaseibacillus casei.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen taken orally, Lacticaseibacillus casei is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Some preparations of L. casei may behave as probiotics and colonize the large bowel (90605).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLacticaseibacillus casei is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, homofermentive, anaerobic bacteria. L. casei is indigenous to the human infant intestinal tract (90605, 101513). It is also found in Chinese traditional pickle, corn liquor, and oat silage (101513).\n\nL. casei is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body where it would normally occur (90605). Most researchers agree that the effectiveness of L. casei and other probiotics for all indications depends on its ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nIn adults with rheumatoid arthritis, Lacticaseibacillus casei appears to have positive benefits on the levels of various inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and increases the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (90230, 90297).\nAntibiotic adverse effect prevention\nIt is theorized that taking probiotics during antibiotic treatment can prevent or minimize normal flora depletion and pathogenic bacteria colonization. There is some evidence to support this theory (5500, 11382). When probiotic lactobacilli latch on to and colonize the intestinal and urogenital mucosa, it seems to prevent epithelial attachment by pathogenic bacteria (4369, 4378, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092). Lactobacilli seem to have this effect by increasing epithelial mucus production and competing with pathogens for mucosal binding sites, possibly through steric hindrance (4388, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092, 7755). Lactobacilli also inhibit bacterial pathogens by producing lactic acid, and some lactobacilli also produce hydrogen peroxide (6089, 6090, 6096). Lacticaseibacillus casei may adhere better to urogenital cells than other lactobacilli (6091).\n\nProbiotic strains may also differ in specific metabolic activities, and not all lactobacilli species inhibit a wide range of pathogenic bacteria (6093). Therefore, some researchers theorize that probiotic preparations containing several species might offer more benefit than a single species (6087, 6094). However, this theory has not yet been evaluated in studies.\nAnticancer effects\nThere is some preliminary evidence that lactobacilli and other probiotics might help protect against cancer. In animal models, lactobacilli have been shown to bind dietary carcinogens (4376) and decrease development of tumors in the colon after carcinogen challenge (4382, 4387, 8564).\nAntioxidant effects\nClinical research in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking a combination of Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum for 6 weeks increases total antioxidant capacity and reduces C reactive protein levels, plasma malondialdehyde levels, and the oxidative stress index. This activity is hypothesized to be caused by improved insulin sensitivity and an upregulation of antioxidative enzymes (98430).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSome researchers think probiotics might have immunomodulating effects (4368, 4369, 8512). Lactobacilli seem to modulate non-specific cellular and humoral immunity possibly by stimulating lymphocyte and macrophage activity (6089, 8565) and modulating cytokine production by mononuclear cells (4379, 8512, 105137). They also seem to decrease markers of hypersensitivity reactions and intestinal inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (4369, 11383). Some lactobacilli also seem to stimulate the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which protects against allergy (7743). In atopic dermatitis, lactobacilli might reduce serum levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL27 which attract T-cells to the skin (17117). They also appear to enhance synthesis of antibodies in response to microbial pathogens, particularly secretory immunoglobulin A (7754, 105137).\n\nWhether lactobacilli administration can increase resistance to infection is unknown. Some preliminary research suggests that lactobacilli and other probiotics might inhibit pathogens such as Candida albicans and prolong survival in immune deficiency states (7746)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, homofermentive, anaerobic bacteria. L. paracasei is found in the human mouth, as well as in fermented cereals, vegetables, meats, and dairy products. Specific strains of L. paracasei are found as probiotics in supplements and functional foods. Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605, 101513).",
            "Warnings": "In April 2020, the genus Lactobacillus was reclassified into 25 different genera (101513). L. paracasei, which was previously classified under the Lactobacillus genus, was reclassified under the Lacticaseibacillus genus. However, some product labels may still identify this species as Lactobacillus paracasei. Some probiotics previously considered to be strains of Lacticaseibacillus casei have been reclassified to L. paracasei. These include L. paracasei strain Shirota, L. paracasei CNCM I-1572 (L. casei DG), L. paracasei DN-114 011, and others. Some of these strains continue to be marketed and referred to in publications as L. casei (105133, 111956, 112515).\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using L. paracasei for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, L. paracasei is not specifically recommended for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when live or heat-killed Lacticaseibacillus paracasei are used orally and appropriately. Live L. paracasei alone or in combination with other probiotics has been safely used in studies lasting up to 4 years (6087, 14370, 14371, 35393, 35407, 103440, 105133, 107555, 107557, 110979)(111937, 111938, 111940, 111943, 111948, 111950, 111951, 111953, 111954, 111955)(111958, 111959, 112512, 112513, 112518, 112519). Non-viable, heat-killed L. paracasei has been safely used in studies lasting up to 3 months (111939, 111940, 111947). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of live or non-viable, heat-killed L. paracasei when used topically.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children of most ages. Lacticaseibacillus paracasei alone or in combination with Limosilactobacillus fermentum has been used with apparent safety for up to 3 months in children 1-18 years old (98440). Also, live or heat-killed L. paracasei LP-33 has been used with apparent safety for 30 days in children aged 5 years and older (107532). In children ages 2-12 years, a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) containing L. paracasei and seven other probiotics has been used safely for 3 months (107497). Also, L. paracasei has been used with apparent safety in combination with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum for up to 12 weeks (107556). L. paracasei DN-114 011 has been taken safely for 90 days in children ages 3-6 years in fermented milk (DanActive, Dannon) (112515). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of L. paracasei in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. A combination of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and Bifidobacterium longum from 2 months prior to delivery until 2 months after delivery has been used with apparent safety (90285).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Mild gastrointestinal adverse effects.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There is concern that Lacticaseibacillus paracasei may cause infections in some people.\nDermatologic\nOrally, in one clinical trial, a combination of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 was associated with two cases of rash, one with itching. However, it is not clear if these adverse effects were due to L. paracasei, other ingredients, the combination, or if the events were idiosyncratic (90236).\n\nTopically, a lotion containing the cell free supernatant of L. paracasei was rarely associated with erythema, itching, and scaling (111945).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, taking Lacticaseibacillus paracasei alone or in combination with other probiotics may cause gastrointestinal side effects including dyspepsia (105133), flatulence (107497), nausea (111952), and bloating (107497, 111952); however, these events are uncommon.\n\nThere are at least five case reports of acute cholecystitis for which a lactobacilli was thought to be the primary pathogen. In a 66-year-old female, vancomycin-resistant L. paracasei was the primary pathogen resulting in peritonitis secondary to a cholecystitis-induced gallbladder perforation. Although the patient reportedly ate 96-128 oz of yogurt each day, this yogurt was not believed to be associated with the cholecystitis (103443).\nless\nImmunologic\nSince Lacticaseibacillus paracasei preparations contain live and active microorganisms, there is some concern that they might cause pathogenic infection in some patients. Lactobacilli species, including L. paracasei, have been isolated in some cases of bacteremia, sepsis, splenic abscess, endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, pancreatic necrosis, meningoencephalitis, and prosthetic joint infections. Most cases of L. paracasei infection are thought to be due to the translocation of bacteria from other locations in the body in which it occurs naturally, such as the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract (107543, 111942, 111944, 111946, 90282). However, there are case reports of L. paracasei infections thought to be at least partially related to dietary or supplemental intake (90254, 107546, 95393). In a 77-year-old male who consumed yogurt containing L. paracasei daily, L. paracasei bacteremia with endocarditis was thought to be related to bacterial translocation from the colon following a colonoscopy (90254). In a 78-year-old male, L. paracasei bacteremia and endocarditis was thought to be related to daily use of probiotics; however, the specific species included in the product were not mentioned. Also, the patient was diagnosed with an aortic valve stenosis and had undergone dental treatment approximately 6 months previously, possibly increasing the risk for development of bacteremia (95393). In an immunocompetent 45-year-old male with no history of heart disease, consumption of yogurt containing L. paracasei for about 2.5 years was thought to be associated with the development of endocarditis (107546).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral live or heat-killed Lacticaseibacillus paracasei seems to improve some symptoms of allergic rhinitis in adults and children.\nClinical research in adults with persistent allergic rhinitis due to grass pollen despite treatment with loratadine shows that taking L. paracasei LP-33 as 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 5 weeks can improve quality of life by almost 18% when compared with placebo. The improvement in quality of life appears to be related to improvements in eye-related symptoms, but not nasal symptoms (90242). In children with perennial allergic rhinitis due to dust mites, taking L. paracasei LP-33 10 billion CFUs daily for 30 days improves quality of life related to overall symptom severity or level of bother by 28% and 23%, respectively, when compared to placebo. However, quality of life related specifically to nasal and eye-related symptoms was not improved when compared with placebo (107532). In children ages 2-5 years with allergic rhinitis, clinical research shows that taking fermented milk (Danone) containing L. paracasei DN-114 011 10 billion CFUs daily does not increase the time free from rhinitis episodes, the mean duration of episodes, or the cumulative number of episodes, when compared with taking a control milk. However, the number of episodes was reduced between months 3-9. The fermented milk was made with the yogurt cultures Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (112512).\n\nHeat-killed L. paracasei has also been investigated. One clinical trial in adults with chronic allergy symptoms shows that taking heat-killed L. paracasei IJH-SONE68 1040 mg or 500,000 cells daily for 12 weeks modestly improves self-reported symptoms, including frequencies of sneezing and blowing, watery eyes, and head dullness, when compared with taking placebo. There was no effect on nasal congestion or itchy eyes (111939). Also, clinical research in children aged 5 years and older with perennial allergic rhinitis due to dust mites shows that taking heat-killed L. paracasei LP-33 10 billion cells daily for 30 days improves quality of life related to overall symptom severity or level of bother by 18% and 22%, respectively, when compared with placebo. Efficacy was not inferior to live L. paracasei LP-33 (107532).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral live Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, alone or in combination with other probiotics, seems to be beneficial for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in infants and children and for preventing atopic dermatitis when provided to the infant after exposure during pregnancy. Small clinical trials suggest that heat-killed L. paracasei does not seem to be beneficial for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.\nIn children aged 1-18 years, clinical research shows that taking L. paracasei 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily, alone or with Limosilactobacillus fermentum 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily each, for 3 months modestly reduces symptoms of atopic dermatitis when compared with placebo (98440). However, another clinical trial shows that administering formula containing lyophilized L. paracasei CNCM I-2116 to infants aged 3-6 months does not reduce atopic dermatitis severity or the prevalence of atopic dermatitis after 12 weeks of treatment (90256).\n\nHeat-killed L. paracasei has also been investigated. In adults treated with conventional topical corticosteroid and tacrolimus, a small clinical trial shows that taking heat-killed L. paracasei K71 200 billion cells daily for 12 weeks does not improve skin symptom severity, quality of life, or use of topical medication, when compared with taking placebo (111947). Also, in infants ages 4-30 months with atopic dermatitis, clinical research shows that, in addition to topical fluticasone propionate cream, taking heat-treated L. paracasei GM-080 daily for 16 weeks does not further improve symptoms when compared with using the topical fluticasone propionate cream alone (102406).\n\nOther clinical research has investigated the effects of L. paracasei in combination with other probiotics for the PREVENTION of atopic dermatitis. A combination of L. paracasei, Ligilactobacillus salivarius, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum, a total of 10 billion CFUs daily provided from 36 weeks' gestation and then to the infant until age 6 months, reduces the prevalence of atopic dermatitis at age two by approximately 60% (90234). Similar findings occurred in clinical research investigating the effect of L. paracasei ST11 and B. longum BL999 (ST11+BL999) for the last 2 months of pregnancy and first 2 months of breastfeeding (90234, 90285).\nless\nCommon cold. A combination of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum seems to be beneficial for reducing the incidence or severity of the common cold. The effects of L. paracasei alone are unclear.\nClinical research in healthy individuals shows that taking an acidified milk drink providing L. paracasei (L. casei 431) 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 21 days before and after receiving the seasonal influenza vaccination does not affect the number, duration, or severity of common cold or influenza-like illness episodes when compared with taking placebo. However, there was a modest reduction in the duration of illness 4-6 weeks after vaccination (111937). L. paracasei has also been examined in combination with L. plantarum. Clinical research shows that taking L. plantarum HEAL 9 (DSM 15312) and L. paracasei 8700:2 (DSM 13434) (Probi Defendum, Probi AB) 1 billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks reduces the incidence of the common cold by about 12% and reduces the number of symptomatic days from 8.6 to 6.2 when compared with placebo (17119). Additional clinical research in adults at increased risk of a common cold shows that taking this same combination for 12 weeks does not reduce the incidence of developing a common cold when compared with placebo. However, symptom severity was modestly reduced. Also, each episode was reduced by an average of 1.1 days (107557). A more recent clinical study in adults at increased risk of developing a common cold shows that taking the same combination does not reduce symptom severity or the absolute number of common cold episodes when compared with placebo. However, in individuals with at least one cold, the mean number of colds was reduced by 0.12 over the 12-week period. In addition, there were modest overall reductions in the incidence of recurring colds and the use of analgesics (107555). A smaller clinical trial using the same product at the same dose and duration has also been conducted in children aged 1-6 years in daycare. The severity of nasal congestion/runny nose was modestly reduced when compared with placebo in this population. However, there were no differences between groups in the overall incidence, severity, or duration of common colds or upper respiratory tract infections or the number of days absent from daycare (107556). This latter trial was terminated prior to the completion of the planned patient recruitment for reasons unrelated to adverse effects, which may have impacted the findings.\n\nL. paracasei has also been investigated as part of fermented milk. A clinical trial in elderly nursing home residents shows that drinking two bottles of fermented milk containing L. paracasei Shirota daily for 6 months does not reduce the risk of developing respiratory symptoms when compared with placebo milk (96885). However, a small clinical study in healthy, male, middle-aged office workers shows that drinking a fermented milk made with L. paracasei Shirota for 12 weeks reduces the incidence and duration of the common cold by 59% when compared with a control milk (98426). Also, a clinical study in children aged 3-6 years attending daycare shows that drinking a fermented milk product containing L. paracasei (Actimel, Danone) 200 grams daily for 3 months reduces the risk of developing the common cold, the most common upper respiratory tract infection in these children, by around 18% when compared with a control milk product. The fermented milk product did not affect medication use or sick leave from daycare (96882).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nConstipation. Oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei does not seem to be beneficial for constipation.\nMeta-analyses of two or three clinical trials in adults with functional constipation show that taking L. paracasei Shirota 6.5-30 billion colony-forming units daily for 4 weeks does not appear to improve gut transit time or increase the number of stools (95342). Also, clinical research in patients with constipation shows that taking a combination of L. paracasei Lpc-37 2.5 billion colony-forming units daily for 2 weeks along with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strains Bl-04, Bi-07, and HN019, does not improve bloating, abdominal pain, intestinal transit time, frequency of bowel movements, or stool consistency when compared with placebo. There was a small beneficial effect on flatulence (110979).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. It is unclear if topical heat-killed Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for acne.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate acne shows that topical application with a lotion providing the cell-free supernatant of L. paracasei MSMC 39-1 twice daily for 4 weeks is as effective as a lotion containing 2.5% benzoyl peroxide for decreasing redness and the inflammatory acne lesion count. There was no effect of either lotion of non-inflammatory acne lesion count (111945). This study is limited by the lack of blinding to lotion type.\nless\nAlcohol-related liver disease. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial in patients with alcohol-related liver disease.\nClinical research in patients with alcohol-related liver disease shows that taking fermented milk providing L. paracasei Shirota daily for 60 days reduces levels of triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 27% and 24%, respectively, compared with taking placebo. There was also an improvement in liver function, based on modest improvements in various liver markers, including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and bilirubin. Patients consumed L. paracasei 20 billion colony-forming units daily (111958).\nless\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for preventing antibiotic-induced diarrhea.\nMost clinical research has investigated the effect of L. paracasei in combination with other probiotics. A meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials in hospitalized or outpatient adults shows that taking L. paracasei in combination with up to 8 other probiotic strains reduces the risk of AAD by 40% when compared with taking placebo (107635). One of these studies, a small clinical trial in patients taking amoxicillin 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, used a specific combination probiotic (Ecologic AAD) twice daily for 14 days. The product provided L. paracasei NIZO 3672, Bifidobacterium bifidum NIZO 3804, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NIZO 3680, Enterococcus faecium NIZO 3886, Lactobacillus acidophilus NIZO 3678 and NIZO 3887, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NIZO 3684, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus NIZO 3689, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius NIZO 3675 as 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each daily (95405). In addition, one small clinical study in hospitalized adults shows that consuming a 97 mL drink (Actimel, Danone) containing L. paracasei 100 CFUs/mL, Streptococcus thermophilus 100 million CFUs/mL, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 10 million CFUs/mL twice daily while taking antibiotics reduces the odds of developing AAD by 75% when compared with a milkshake without probiotics (16740). However, an additional large clinical trial in children aged 3 months and up shows that taking L. paracasei in combination with other probiotics does not reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea when compared with taking placebo, when the more stringent definition is considered excluding diarrhea of other etiologies. However, the risk of diarrhea of any etiology is reduced by 35%. The probiotic supplement provided a total of 10 billion CFUs of L. paracasei W20, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Lactobacillus acidophilus W55, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis W51, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum W62, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus W71, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24 daily from the first day of antibiotic treatment until 7 days after treatment ended (110969). It is unclear if any benefits are due to L. paracasei, the other ingredients, or their combination.\n\nL. paracasei has also been investigated alone. In hospitalized patients with spinal cord injury, preliminary clinical research shows that 17.1% of patients taking L. paracasei Shirota 6.5 billion CFUs daily in a probiotic drink (Yakult light) developed diarrhea compared with 54.9% of those given only routine care. L. paracasei was taken during antibiotic treatment and for an additional 7 days (111955). This study is limited by a lack of blinding.\nless\nAntituberculosis treatment-associated adverse effects. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for preventing adverse effects associated with antituberculosis treatment.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking L. paracasei Shirota 10 billion or 20 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily during standard antituberculosis treatment does not reduce the incidence of liver injury when compared with antituberculosis treatment alone. However, there was a modest decrease in the incidence of elevated alkaline phosphatase in patients taking 20 billion CFUs daily and a modest decrease in the incidence of elevated bilirubin in patients taking 10 billion CFUs daily. There was no effect on other liver markers (107509). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking this same dose daily for 2 months during standard antituberculosis treatment reduces the rate of any gastrointestinal adverse event to 29% to 38% of patients, compared with 50% of those taking antituberculosis treatment alone. In addition, the duration of symptoms was shorter. However, when individual gastrointestinal adverse events were evaluated, only the incidence and duration of vomiting and appetite loss were reduced; the incidence of nausea, diarrhea, flatulence, and constipation were unaffected (107542).\nless\nAsthenopia (eye strain). It is unclear if oral heat-killed Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for asthenopia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking heat-killed L. paracasei 50 mg daily for 8 weeks does not decrease eye fatigue induced by blue-light emitting devices when compared with placebo. However, a subgroup analysis shows that in patients who report eye fatigue at baseline, subjective symptoms of eye fatigue and eye redness are reduced after exposure to blue-light emitting devices (98429).\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for asthma.\nA small clinical study in children with asthma shows that taking L. paracasei GMNL-133 (LP) 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Limosilactobacillus fermentum GM-090 (LF) 2 billion CFUs, or both strains together daily for 3 months seems to modestly reduce asthma severity and increase Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) scores when compared with placebo (99785). In children ages 2-5 years with asthma, clinical research shows that taking fermented milk (Danone) containing L. paracasei DN-114 011 10 billion colony-forming units daily does not increase the time free from asthma episodes, the mean duration of episodes, or the cumulative number of episodes, when compared with taking a control milk. The fermented milk was made with the yogurt cultures Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (112512).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei for cancer prevention or treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. paracasei for this condition.\nCanker sores. Oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking a combination of L. paracasei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis modestly reduces pain, but not the number of lesions or healing time, when compared with placebo (107548).\nless\nColic. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei for colic, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. paracasei for this condition.\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention.\nClinical research in patients with previous removal of colorectal tumors shows that taking at least 1.5 billion colony-forming units L. paracasei Shirota 3 times daily for 4 years does not prevent the development of new colorectal tumors when compared with not taking L. paracasei. However, taking L. paracasei reduces the occurrence of colorectal tumors with moderate or severe atypia by 35%. Half of the patients included in this research were also consuming wheat bran biscuits (111959).\nless\nDental caries. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for dental caries prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that giving infants a weaning cereal containing L. paracasei F19 (Semper AB) from 4 months of age until 13 months of age does not reduce the risk of dental caries in the primary or permanent teeth by the age of 3, 6, or 9 years (90260).\nless\nDepression. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei for depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. paracasei for this condition.\nDiabetes. Oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking a specific product containing L. paracasei and other probiotics (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) as a total of 112.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for 8 weeks does not affect levels of fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo. However, there were small improvements in insulin levels and insulin resistance (107549).\n\nThis same combination probiotic has also been evaluated in children 2-12 years of age with new-onset type 1 diabetes. One clinical study shows that taking Visbiome as 112.5 billion CFUs daily for 3 months modestly decreases HbA1c and insulin requirements when compared with placebo. Also, about three times as many children achieved remission, defined as insulin requirements of less than 0.5 U/kg daily and HbA1c of less than 7%. However, C-peptide levels and the maintenance of residual pancreatic beta-cell function were not affected when compared with placebo (107497).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for the treatment of diarrhea.\nWhile the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388), both guidelines note that most evidence is low quality. Also, evidence related to the use of L. paracasei, specifically, is limited. One large clinical study shows that taking a fermented milk product containing L. paracasei DN-114 001 (e.g., DanActive, Dannon) 100 million CFUs per milliliter for up to 4 months helps to prevent acute, non-rotaviral diarrhea in children ages 6-24 months (14374).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for exercise-induced muscle damage.\nClinical research in adults shows that taking L. paracasei L-PS23 20 billion colony-forming units or heat-killed L. paracasei HK-PS23 20 billion cells daily modestly reduces muscle strength loss and improves measures of muscle recovery in the 48 hours following exercise-induced muscle damage when compared with taking placebo. L. paracasei was taken for 6 weeks prior to inducing muscle damage and continued for an additional 48 hours (111940).\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for preventing respiratory infections related to exercise.\nClinical research in endurance athletes shows that taking a probiotic supplement containing L. paracasei Shirota (LCS, Yakult) 65 billion colon-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for 20 weeks does not reduce the risk of developing an upper respiratory tract infection when compared with placebo. Taking this probiotic also does not reduce the duration or severity of respiratory infections in this population (98431). However, other clinical research shows that taking L. paracasei Shirota 6.5 billion CFUs daily for 4 months during winter endurance training modestly reduces the proportion of athletes with at least 1 week with upper respiratory tract illness symptoms by 27%, and the total number of episodes by 0.9, when compared with taking placebo. There was no difference in symptom severity or duration (111950).\nless\nFractures. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for the healing of fractures.\nA clinical study in elderly adults with distal radius fracture shows that consuming 100 mL of skim milk containing L. paracasei Shirota 12 billion colony-forming units twice daily for 3 months modestly improves hand function, pain, and daily life activities when compared with skimmed milk placebo (102407). This study is limited by the fact that, although subjective measures showed improvement, there was no consistent improvement in objective measures.\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial in children with H. pylori infection.\nClinical research in H. pylori-colonized children aged 6 to 17 years shows that taking a fermented dairy product containing live or heat-killed L. paracasei ST11 (Chamyto, Nestle'-Chile SA, Santiago, Chile) 1.6 billion cells or colony-forming units 5 days each week for 4 weeks does not reduce H. pylori colonization when compared with the beverage without L. paracasei. The beverages were fermented with Lactobacillus helveticus (110934).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. paracasei for this condition.\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for hypercholesterolemia.\nA small clinical trial in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking 10.5 billion colony-forming units of L. paracasei TISTR 2593 daily for 90 days reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by about 11% when compared with taking placebo. There was no effect on total or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglyceride levels (111938).\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for improving sleep quality.\nA small clinical trial in students shows that taking fermented milk containing L. paracasei Shirota daily for 11 weeks, starting 8 weeks prior to a stressful standardized examination, modestly reduces feelings of sleepiness upon rising and increases sleep length when compared with a non-fermented placebo milk. Objective measures of sleep latency were also reduced. There was no effect on total sleep time or sleep efficacy (111949).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for IBS.\nOne clinical study shows that taking a specific multi-species probiotic (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) containing L. paracasei and seven other probiotics as 450 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily in two divided doses for 8 weeks improves abdominal bloating, but not abdominal pain, flatulence, or number of stools, in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) (11379). However, adding this product as 900 billion CFUs daily to a sham diet or a low-FODMAP diet for 4 weeks does not improve IBS symptoms when compared with placebo (98741). Another clinical study in patients with IBS-D shows that taking a specific multi-species probiotic (NordBiotic, MBM Biotix) containing L. paracasei LPC100, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR110, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA120, Lacticaseibacillus casei LC130, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LP140, Bifidobacterium breve BB010, Bifidobacterium longum BL020, Bifidobacterium bifidum BF030, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL040, and Streptococcus thermophilus ST250 as 2.5 billion CFUs total twice daily for 8 weeks improves overall symptom severity, as well as pain severity, pain frequency, and quality of life when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was rated as mild by approximately 60% of those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 30% of those taking placebo (107516). However, other clinical research shows that taking L. paracasei HA-196 10 billion CFUs daily or L. paracasei Shirota 13 billion CFUs daily for 8 weeks or a combination of L. paracasei, L. acidophilus, and B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (Cultura) 13-20 billion CFUs daily for 6 months does not improve most symptoms of IBS (90236, 94696, 94697, 103440, 111952).\n\nL. paracasei has also been examined in combination with other ingredients. In patients 60 years and older with IBS, taking L. paracasei DKGF1 100 billion CFUs daily with Opuntia humifusa extract more than doubles the proportion of patients with improvements in self-reported overall symptoms during more than 2 of the 4 weeks of treatment when compared with taking placebo. Response rates for abdominal pain and psychological well-being were also improved. However, there were no differences between groups for response rates related to improvements in gas or bloating (111943).\nless\nJapanese cedar pollinosis. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for Japanese cedar pollinosis.\nClinical research in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis shows that taking L. paracasei KW3110 at least one trillion colony-forming units daily for 12 weeks starting 1 month before the start of the pollen season does not improve nasal symptoms during peak season when compared with taking placebo (111948).\nless\nLower respiratory tract infections. Oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in children ages 3-6 years shows that taking taking fermented milk (DanActive, Dannon) containing L. paracasei DN-114 011 20 billion colony-forming units daily for 90 days does not prevent lower respiratory tract infections when compared with taking a control non-fermented milk. The fermented milk was made with the yogurt cultures Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (112515).\nless\nLyme disease. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. paracasei for this condition.\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for migraine treatment.\nClinical research in patients with moderate to severe vestibular symptoms associated with migraine headaches shows that taking L. paracasei Shirota 20 billion colony-forming units daily for 4 months modestly reduces symptoms of vertigo and dizziness. The number of attacks with vertigo each week was reduced by 1.6, compared with 0.9 in patients taking placebo. Both vertigo and dizziness severity, as well as feelings of anxiety and depression, were also modestly reduced (111951). Although changes in these endpoints were statistically significant after 4 months, there were no differences between endpoints after 2 months, and the clinical significance is unclear.\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial or safe for NEC prevention.\nMost meta-analyses of clinical research show that giving lactobacilli enterally reduces the risk of NEC and/or severe NEC in preterm, mainly very low birth weight (VLBW), infants. Some meta-analyses support the use of lactobacilli in combination with bifidobacteria, as opposed to lactobacilli alone for reducing the risk of NEC. However, the effects of L. paracasei, specifically, are unclear (95344, 95351, 103437, 103445, 104157, 105162, 105164). Also, guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies with respect to the use of probiotics in very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in this group of infants (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608). The Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that probiotic combinations may be of benefit in reducing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates over 1000 grams. However, L. paracasei is not specifically recommended (103003, 111609, 111611).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with NAFLD shows that taking 2 sachets daily for 3 months of a specific combination product (VSL#3) containing L. paracasei and other probiotics modestly decreases triglyceride levels and liver enzymes when compared with taking placebo. However, there was no change in body mass index or most glycemic or lipid parameters (111009). The effect of L. paracasei alone is unclear from this study.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for osteoarthritis.\nA large clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of knee osteoarthritis shows that taking skim milk containing L. paracasei Shirota 6 billion colony-forming units twice daily for 6 months modestly improves stiffness, pain, and function when compared with taking skim milk placebo (111953). More research is needed to determine whether L. paracasei Shirota is as effective as standard medications.\nless\nPain (acute). It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for acute pain.\nClinical research in patients with a single rib fracture shows that taking skim milk containing L. paracasei Shirota 6 billion colony-forming units daily for 1 month modestly reduces pain during deep breathing, coughing, and turning over when compared with taking skim milk placebo. Good pain relief during these situations, defined as a decline in maximal pain intensity of 3 points on a 10-point scale, occurred in 42.1% to 61.6% of patients, compared with 25.9% to 47.3% of patients taking placebo. However, there was no effect on sleep quality (111957).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for Parkinson disease.\nClinical research in patients with Parkinson disease shows that taking fermented milk providing L. paracasei Shirota 10 billion colony-forming units daily for 12 weeks reduces the use of laxatives by 0.37 or 15% per week and modestly improves stool consistency and symptoms of constipation when compared with taking an acidified milk placebo. There were also modest improvements in non-motor symptoms, anxiety, and depression, but not overall disease severity or dopaminergic therapy requirement (111956).\nless\nPostoperative infection. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei for preventing postoperative infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. paracasei for this purpose.\nPouchitis. Oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that continuous oral treatment for one year with a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) containing L. paracasei and other probiotics, 6 grams (300-500 billion live bacteria per gram) daily, for up to 12 months seems to maintain remission in 85% of patients with pouchitis (6087, 12769).\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking probiotics during pregnancy reduces the severity and duration of nausea and vomiting by 16% to 54%. There was also a small benefit on stool hardness. A specific probiotic (Probiotics 10, Nature's Bounty) was taken as 2 capsules daily for two back-to-back cycles of six days with probiotics and two days without. Each capsule contained a total of 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of L. paracasei DSM 13434 and Lpc-37, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v and DSM 15312, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus Lb-87, Ligilactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-35, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14, Lacticaseibacillus casei Lc-11, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04, along with inulin 200 mg (107199).\nless\nProstatitis. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for prostatitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with chronic bacterial prostatitis who are receiving antibiotic treatment shows that taking L. paracasei CNCM I-1572 (L. casei DG) one capsule twice daily for 6 months improves clinical symptoms over baseline in 73% of patients and also reduces symptomatic recurrence and antibiotic use (105133). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nProton pump inhibitor-induced gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for preventing GI symptoms in patients using proton pump inhibitors.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease shows that taking L. paracasei F19 (Genefilus F19, Siffra Farmaceutici S.r.l., Italy) 24 billion colony-forming units 3 times a week for 3 or 6 months during treatment with pantoprazole 40 mg daily modestly reduces stool frequency and the severity and proportion of patients with flatulence and bloating when compared with taking placebo (111941).\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. Oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy shows that taking 96 mL fermented milk (Danone) 3 times daily containing L. paracasei DN-114 001 100 million colony-forming units per gram starting one week before the initiation of radiation treatment does not delay the development of diarrhea when compared with taking a control sterilized milk product. The fermented milk was continued throughout treatment and made with the yogurt cultures Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (112513).\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for rotaviral diarrhea.\nThe current guidelines related to the treatment of viral diarrhea are conflicting. While the World Gastroenterology Organization has not made a recommendation (98471), the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388). However, these guidelines note that most evidence is low quality and is not specific to rotavirus infection. Furthermore, these guidelines were released prior to the publication of the most recent, high-quality studies showing no benefit with the use of certain probiotics (98427, 98428). Also, research on the use of L. paracasei, specifically, is lacking.\nless\nSarcopenia. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei for sarcopenia prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. paracasei for this purpose.\nShort bowel syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei for short bowel syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. paracasei for this condition.\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for the treatment of SIBO.\nOne preliminary clinical study in adults with irritable bowel syndrome and a recent diagnosis of SIBO shows that consuming 65 mL of a specific product (Yakult, Yakult Ltd.) providing 6.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of L. paracasei Shirota by mouth daily for 6 weeks modestly improves flatulence, but not other symptoms, when compared to baseline (91144).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nThe best evidence of benefit is for a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma). Doses of 3 grams (equivalent to 900 billion colony-forming units (CFUs)) once or twice daily have been used in combination with conventional treatment. In children aged 1-16 years, doses of 450-1800 billion CFUs for up to one year have been used (3261, 14370, 14371, 16841, 95337). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking this product as an adjunct to standard ulcerative colitis treatment can increase remissions rates in adults and children by about 1.7-fold when compared with standard treatment alone (95337). There is also evidence that it is beneficial for improving remission rates in patients who do not adequately respond to conventional treatment (14371).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in children ages 3-6 years shows that taking taking fermented milk (DanActive, Dannon) containing L. paracasei DN-114 011 20 billion colony-forming units daily for 90 days reduces the incidence of URTIs by 18% when compared with taking a control non-fermented milk. The fermented milk was made with the yogurt cultures Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (112515).\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is beneficial for the treatment of SIBO.\nClinical research in patients with a recent episiotomy shows that taking L. paracasei (L. casei 431) 1.5 billion colony-forming units daily for 14 days modestly improves wound severity, including redness, swelling, and discharge, 5 and 15 days after birth when compared with taking placebo. There was no effect on wound pain (112519).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus paracasei for C. difficile infection prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. paracasei for this condition.\nMore evidence is needed to rate Lacticaseibacillus paracasei for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen taken orally, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Some preparations of L. paracasei may behave as probiotics and colonize the large bowel (90605, 112512).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLacticaseibacillus paracasei is a species of lactic acid-producing, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, homofermentive, anaerobic bacteria. L. paracasei is found in the human mouth, as well as in fermented cereals, vegetables, meats, and dairy product (90605, 101513).\n\nL. paracasei is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605). Most researchers agree that the effectiveness of L. paracasei and other probiotics for all indications depends on its ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn patients with osteoarthritis, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei reduces serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). The decrease in CRP was associated with improvements in pain and function (111953). In patients with alcoholic liver injury, L. paracasei reduced levels of inflammatory factor including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1beta and increased levels of IL-10 (111958).\nAntibiotic adverse effect prevention\nIt is theorized is that taking probiotics during antibiotic treatment can prevent or minimize normal flora depletion and pathogenic bacteria colonization. There is some evidence to support this theory (5500, 11382). When probiotic lactobacilli latch on to and colonize the intestinal and urogenital mucosa, it seems to prevent epithelial attachment by pathogenic bacteria (4369, 4378, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092). Lactobacilli seem to have this effect by increasing epithelial mucus production and competing with pathogens for mucosal binding sites, possibly through steric hindrance (4388, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092, 7755). Lactobacilli also inhibit bacterial pathogens by producing lactic acid, and some lactobacilli also produce hydrogen peroxide (6089, 6090, 6096).\n\nProbiotic strains may also differ in specific metabolic activities, and not all lactobacilli species inhibit a wide range of pathogenic bacteria (6093). Therefore, some researchers theorize that probiotic preparations containing several species might offer more benefit than a single species (6087, 6094). However, this theory has not yet been evaluated in studies.\nAnticancer effects\nThere is some preliminary evidence that lactobacilli and other probiotics might help protect against cancer. In animal models, lactobacilli have been shown to bind dietary carcinogens (4376) and decrease development of tumors in the colon after carcinogen challenge (4382, 4387, 8564).\nCardioprotective effects\nLacticaseibacillus paracasei may have cardioprotective effects. In human research, L. paracasei reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. L. paracasei also had antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in adults with hypercholesterolemia. The inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was reduced after 90 days of supplementation. However, there was no effect on interleukin (IL)-10 or IL-6 (111938).\nGastrointestinal effects\nProbiotics including Lacticaseibacillus paracasei are being used for pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. Some evidence suggests that patients who develop pouchitis have a low number of bacteria, but a high number of fungal flora in the mucosa of the pouch. Treatment with a specific combination probiotic containing L. paracasei and seven other probiotic species (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) seems to decrease fungal flora and increase bacterial flora, including modification towards more anaerobic flora (14376). There is also some preliminary research that suggests the ability of lactobacilli to reduce adherence of pathogenic bacteria to the colonic mucosa, and to reduce bacterial translocation. This might make them useful in the prevention of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and in the treatment of conditions such as Crohn disease (7750, 7754, 17116).\nHepatoprotective effects\nTuberculosis treatment is associated with the development of liver injury. Clinical research shows that taking Lacticaseibacillus paracasei has some moderate hepatoprotective effects. This activity may be related to the beneficial effects of L. paracasei on the intestinal barrier function and changes in the gut microbiota (107509).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSome researchers think probiotics might have immunomodulating effects (4368, 4369, 8512). Lactobacilli seem to modulate non-specific cellular and humoral immunity possibly by stimulating lymphocyte and macrophage activity (6089, 8565) and modulating cytokine production by mononuclear cells (4379, 8512, 105137). They also seem to decrease markers of hypersensitivity reactions and intestinal inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (4369, 11383). Some lactobacilli also seem to stimulate the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which protects against allergy (7743). In atopic dermatitis, lactobacilli might reduce serum levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL27 which attract T-cells to the skin (17117). They also appear to enhance synthesis of antibodies in response to microbial pathogens, particularly secretory immunoglobulin A (7754, 105137). Clinical research suggests that orally administered Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Shirota seems to increase the production of natural killer cells (98426), as well as levels of IgA in saliva (111950). Also, in endurance trained athletes, taking L. paracasei Shirota for 20 weeks reduces cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus antibody titers, indicating immunomodulation through an unknown mechanism of action (98431). However, in other human research, L. paracasei does not seem to affect levels of blood levels of IgA, IgE, or IgM, changes in leukocyte or lymphocyte counts or activity, or the immune response to influenza vaccination (111937, 111939, 111948, 111950).\nOphthalmic effects\nLaboratory research shows that heat-killed Lacticaseibacillus paracasei reduces the rate of human retinal pigment epithelial cell damage upon exposure to blue light by activation of M2 macrophages. Clinical research shows that taking this product by mouth does not reduce eye fatigue from blue-light emitting devices, although it might have some benefit in patients with self-reported eye fatigue at baseline (98429)."

            "Overview": "Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. L. rhamnosus is found in the mouth, vagina, and intestinal tract, as well as in fermented meat, fish, vegetables, and cereals. Specific strains of L. rhamnosus are found as probiotics in supplements and functional foods. Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605, 101513).",
            "Warnings": "In April 2020, the genus Lactobacillus was reclassified into 25 different genera (101513). L. rhamnosus, which was previously classified under the Lactobacillus genus, was reclassified under the Lacticaseibacillus genus. However, some product labels may still identify this species as Lactobacillus rhamnosus.\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Despite claims to the contrary, there is no good evidence to support using L. rhamnosus for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, L. rhamnosus is not specifically recommended for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has been safely used alone or in combination with other probiotics in studies lasting up to 6 months (4367, 12108, 35393, 105134, 107569, 107572, 107573, 107575, 107577, 111793)(111996, 111997, 111998, 112493, 112496, 112503, 112508). ...when used intravaginally and appropriately. L. rhamnosus has been used safely in studies lasting from one week to six months (4397, 12108, 90283, 111999).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of non-viable, heat-killed L. rhamnosus formulations when used orally.\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children of most ages. The strain Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG has been used safely in studies lasting from five days to 36 months (4369, 4372, 4373, 4377, 7741, 8565, 8566, 8567, 8568, 14334)(90280, 96889, 98427, 98428, 99782, 107518, 107539, 107571, 110988, 112000)(112491, 112492, 112494, 112502). L. rhamnosus LOCK 0900 has been used safely in combination with other probiotics for 3 months (107510). There is insufficient reliable information about the safety of non-viable, heat-killed L. rhamnosus formulations in children when taken orally. Also, there is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of L. rhamnosus in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given L. rhamnosus and other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG has been used with apparent safety starting 2-4 weeks before delivery (7743, 8515). L. rhamnosus HN001 has been used from 14-16 weeks' gestation until 6 months post-delivery (96888, 98437). The combination of L. rhamnosus with Bifidobacterium longum has been used from 2 months prior to delivery until 2 months after delivery or throughout pregnancy (90285, 105128, 105144). The combination of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and Limosilactobacillus reuteri RC-14 has been used for up to two trimesters during pregnancy (102292, 107562). A combination of L. rhamnosus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Lactobacillus gasseri has been used safely for 3-4 weeks from 32-36 weeks' gestation (105131).\nPREGNANCY: A meta-analysis of four clinical trials shows that taking probiotics during pregnancy increases the relative risk of pre-eclampsia by 85% when compared with placebo. Although the specific effects of L. rhamnosus are unclear from this analysis, two of the included studies used L. rhamnosus GG and one used L. rhamnosus HN001 (105185). More information is needed to determine if certain patients are at increased risk.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG has been used with apparent safety when breastfeeding for up to six months (7743, 8515) and L. rhamnosus HN001 has been used from 14-16 weeks' gestation until 6 months post-delivery (96888, 98437). A combination of L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium longum has been used with apparent safety from 2 months prior to delivery until 2 months after delivery (90285).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Mild gastrointestinal adverse effects.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There is concern that L. rhamnosus may cause infections in some people.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, taking Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus alone or in combination with other probiotics may cause gastrointestinal side effects including diarrhea (90235); however, these events are uncommon. In one small clinical study in infants with suspected cow's milk allergy who were receiving extensively hydrolyzed whey formula, diarrhea occurred in 5 of 13 infants receiving non-viable, heat-killed L. rhamnosus, compared with 0 of 14 infants receiving live L. rhamnosus and 0 of 8 infants receiving placebo (107528).\n\nA 31-year-old male developed severe L. rhamnosus GG stomatitis and oral ulcers while undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. The strain in the ulcers was determined to be the same strain that had been consumed in dairy products (112506).\nless\nImmunologic\nSince Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus preparations contain live and active microorganisms, there is some concern that they might cause pathological infection in some patients. Some lactobacilli species have been isolated in some cases of bacteremia, sepsis, splenic abscess, endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, pancreatic necrosis, and meningoencephalitis. Most of these cases are thought to be due to the translocation of bacteria from other locations in the body in which they occur naturally, such as the oral cavity and gastrointestinal system, in ill and/or immunocompromised patients, or in patients otherwise at risk of infection. However, there are also rare case reports of pathological infections possibly to intake of L. rhamnosus products in these populations (4380, 4390, 4391, 4398, 8561, 13008, 13070, 90298, 103444, 105138)(105139, 105141, 107543, 111613, 112499, 112505, 112509, 112536).\n\nCase reports exist of bacteremia or sepsis associated with L. rhamnosus use in infants and children. In infants, some cases have occurred following the use of L. rhamnosus for the treatment or prevention of diarrhea. These cases include a severely ill 6-week-old infant given L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (13008), a 6-day old with intrauterine growth restriction given L. rhamnosus GG to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (112509), a 3-month-old infant given L. rhamnosus GG for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and a 18-day-old preterm, very-low-birthweight infant given L. rhamnosus GG for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis (111613). In other cases, infants with short bowel syndrome have developed bacteremia (13008, 112536). One case report involved an 11-month-old infant receiving L. rhamnosus for 5 weeks through a gastrostomy tube for rotaviral diarrhea (13070). Lactobacillus sepsis has also occurred in a 6-year-old child with cerebral palsy following use of L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) for intermittent diarrhea (13008). A 17-year-old male with ulcerative colitis developed bacteremia following once daily use of L. rhamnosus GG 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) (Culturelle, ConAgra Foods) (90298).\n\nThere are also cases of L. rhamnosus bacteremia or sepsis in adults. Fatal L. rhamnosus septicemia has been reported in an immunocompromised patient consuming yogurt and taking prolonged courses of multiple broad spectrum antibiotics (8561). A 50-year-old male developed L. rhamnosus endocarditis following daily use of a probiotic product providing at least 5 billion CFUs of L. rhamnosus. Although the patient was considered healthy, the role of a previous diagnosis of an unspecified heart murmur or an untreated deep gingival cut 3 months prior to endocarditis diagnosis may have increased the risk of infection (105139). A 56-year-old immunocompetent female developed L. rhamnosus GG bacteremia. She was hospitalized with an indwelling catheter following a motor vehicle accident and had been given this strain following the onset of diarrhea via a nasogastric tube as per hospital protocol (112499). There is also a case of L. rhamnosus sepsis in a male in his late 60s with a bioprosthetic aortic valve. He was taking L. rhamnosus for ulcerative colitis and developed sepsis along with aortic valve endocarditis and septic emboli to the brain (112505).\n\nA specific probiotic preparation (NBL probiotic ATP, Nobel) containing L. rhamnosus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, colostrum, and lactoferrin was found to be a significant risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus colonization in premature infants. Although there was no direct link to determine causation, it was hypothesized that the probiotic mixture helped to mediate the acquisition and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (96890).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG seems to reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in adults and children.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that taking L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) can reduce the risk of AAD in adults and children (4371, 4372, 7306, 8511, 14334, 90299, 95348). This strain appears to reduce the risk of AAD by about 60% to 71% (14334, 90299, 95348, 95398). Although some contradictory evidence exists (7306), a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking this strain is beneficial in both inpatient and outpatient populations (90299). In children, it has been used as 10-20 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) once daily or 20 billion CFUs twice daily, given throughout the conventional antimicrobial treatment period (4371, 4372, 8511, 14334). In adults, it has been used as 6-40 billion CFUs daily (14334, 95348). However, some research suggests that this strain may only be effective in children, not adults (95389).\n\nThe effect of L. rhamnosus has also been examined in combination with other products. A meta-analysis of 5 clinical trials in hospitalized or outpatient adults shows that taking L. rhamnosus, usually in combination with other probiotic strains, reduces the risk of AAD by 29% when compared with taking placebo (107635). A number of combination products containing L. rhamnosus have demonstrated benefit for preventing AAD, including L. rhamnosus CLR2, Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, and Lacticaseibacillus casei LBC80R (Bio-K+ Cl1285) 100 billion CFUs daily (95402, 95403, 25494); L. rhamnosus R0011 7.6 billion CFUs and Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 0.4 billion CFUs daily (Lacidofil STRONG, Lallemand Health Solutions) (96891); and Bifidobacterium bifidum NIZO 3804, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NIZO 3680, Enterococcus faecium NIZO 3886, L. acidophilus NIZO 3678 and NIZO 3887, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei NIZO 3672, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NIZO 3684, L. rhamnosus NIZO 3689, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius NIZO 3675 (Ecologic AAD) (95405).\n\nHowever, some combination products containing L. rhamnosus have not demonstrated benefit with respect to AAD prevention. In older adults in long-term care, taking a combination of L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12) daily does not reduce the incidence or number of days with AAD over a 12-month period when compared with placebo (103425). In a small clinical trial in children aged 5 months to 16 years, taking a combination of L. rhamnosus KL53A, L. plantarum PL02, and Bifidobacterium longum PL03 twice daily during antibiotic treatment does not reduce the rate of AAD when compared with placebo. However, there was a modest reduction in the number of stools each day (107553). An additional large clinical trial in children aged 3 months and up shows that taking L. rhamnosus in combination with other probiotics does not reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea when compared with taking placebo, when the more stringent definition is considered excluding diarrhea of other etiologies. However, the risk of diarrhea of any etiology is reduced by 35%. The probiotic supplement provided a total of 10 billion CFUs of L. rhamnosus W71, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Lactobacillus acidophilus W55, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum W62, Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis W51 daily from the first day of antibiotic treatment until 7 days after treatment ended (110969).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral live Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, alone or in combination with other probiotics, seems to be beneficial for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in infants and children. It also seems to be beneficial for preventing atopic dermatitis when taken by the infant after exposure during pregnancy, but it is unclear if taking L. rhamnosus only during pregnancy or lactation is beneficial for preventing atopic dermatitis.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that various species of lactobacilli reduce the severity of atopic dermatitis in infants and children up to 36 months of age. Children with moderate to severe disease seem to obtain greater benefit from supplementation than those with mild disease (98436). One specific strain has shown benefit. Clinical research in infants shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG in extensively hydrolyzed whey formula providing approximately 30 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) per kg daily modestly reduces symptom severity when compared with taking placebo (107528). Other clinical research in children ages 6-36 months shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG 10 billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks more than doubles the proportion of patients with a clinically important reduction in severity when compared with taking placebo. These benefits lasted for at least 4 weeks post-supplementation. The number of days without rescue medication was reduced by about 3 days (112491). Some clinical research also shows that L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) might be beneficial for reducing symptoms of atopic dermatitis in infants who are allergic to cow's milk (4369). L. rhamnosus has also been shown to have beneficial effects when used in combination with other probiotics. Examples include a specific mixture (Latopic, Biomed S.A.) providing 1 billion CFUs of L. rhamnosus ŁOCK 0900 25%, L. rhamnosus ŁOCK 0908 25%, and Lacticaseibacillus casei ŁOCK 0919 50% for 3 months in children under 2 years of age (107510), and a combination of lyophilized L. rhamnosus 19070-2 and Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 122460 as 10 billion CFUs of each strain twice daily for 6 weeks in children aged 1-13 years (12773).\n\nHeat-killed L. rhamnosus has also been evaluated. In children aged 1-12 years with moderate atopic dermatitis, taking heat-killed L. rhamnosus IDCC 3201 (RHT3201) 10 billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces overall symptom severity when compared with placebo. However, these benefits were not shown in the intention to treat analysis. Also, the use of topical corticosteroids was not reduced (107527).\n\nLimited research has also evaluated oral L. rhamnosus for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in adults. One clinical study shows that taking 1 billion CFUs each of L. rhamnosus LRH020, Lactiplantbacillus plantarum PBS067, and L. reuteri PBS072 for 56 days modestly reduces the severity of symptoms and improves skin smoothness and moisturization for up to an additional 28 days when compared with placebo (107506).\n\nOther research has investigated the effects of L. rhamnosus for the PREVENTION of atopic dermatitis. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that perinatal use of L. rhamnosus alone or in combination with other probiotics reduces the incidence of atopic dermatitis by up to 40% in children up to 2 years of age or 6-7 years of age. However, this benefit did not occur in children ages 4-5 years or 10-11 years. In these studies, L. rhamnosus was used prenatally and then possibly postnatally during lactation and/or supplemented to the newborn (112494). The reason for the age-related discrepancy is unclear; however, the number of studies investigating the effect of L. rhamnosus in children over 2 years of age was small. When lactobacilli-based probiotics are used during gestation and then supplemented to the newborn during the first 2-24 months of life, additional meta-analyses of clinical research show that this reduces the risk of the child developing atopic dermatitis by up to 40%. Most of the studies included in these analysis used L. rhamnosus GG or HN001 alone or in combination with other probiotics (90247, 107503). Regimens used in some clinical research include L. rhamnosus HN001 as 6 billion CFUs daily from 35 weeks' gestation until 6 months after delivery in adults or 6 billion CFUs daily from birth to 2 years old (90603), L. rhamnosus HN001 starting at 14 weeks' gestation and continuing until 6 months postpartum (98437), as well as combinations of L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis 1 billion CFUs daily for 6 months (102286), L. rhamnosus LPR and Bifidobacterium longum BL999 (90285), and L. rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis BB-12 in fermented milk starting at 36 weeks' gestation and continuing until 3 months' postpartum (96893).\n\nSome research has investigated differences between the various perinatal dosing schedules. Subgroup analyses of clinical research show that the incidence of atopic dermatitis is reduced by 48% and 34% in infants receiving L. rhamnosus prenatally and then during lactation OR via direct supplementation, respectively. However, the incidence of atopic dermatitis was not reduced in infants receiving L. rhamnosus prenatally and then during lactation AND via direct supplementation (112494). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear but may be related to the different forms of supplementation, levels found in the body, and/or the age of the child at diagnosis (98437, 112494).\nless\nAtopic disease. Taking oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG during pregnancy and when breastfeeding, or giving it to the infant, seems to prevent atopic disease in infants and children.\nClinical research shows that L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle), 10-20 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily taken orally 2-4 weeks before delivery and continued for the first 3-6 months of breastfeeding, prevents atopic disease (e.g., asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema) in infants with a family history of atopy. It appears to be equally effective when taken while breastfeeding or when taken by the bottle-feeding infant (7743, 8515, 11381). For the bottle-feeding infant, L. rhamnosus GG was given as 10-20 billion CFUs daily in formula (Nutramigen LGG, Mead Johnson Nutrition) for the first 3-36 months of life (7743, 8515). The preventive effect of this strain in at-risk infants appears to extend up to 7 years of age (11381, 99791). Other research shows that L. rhamnosus HN001, 6 billion CFUs daily taken from 35 weeks' gestation and then continued in the infant until 2 years of age, reduces the risk of atopic dermatitis by 43% and rhinoconjunctivitis by 62% when compared with placebo at 4 years of age (90603). These preventive effects appear to extend up to 11 years of age (99791).\n\nClinical research in infants with cow's milk allergy also shows that adding L. rhamnosus GG to a hydrolyzed casein infant formula (Nutramigen LGG, Mead Johnson Nutrition) reduces the overall occurrence of other allergic manifestations when compared with casein infant formula alone. Approximately 4 infants need to take this supplemented formula in order to prevent one allergic manifestation, such as eczema, rash, asthma, and runny nose or eyes. The tolerance to cow's milk allergy is also improved over the next 3 years (96889).\n\nHowever, not all strains or methods of administration appear to be beneficial. Intake of L. rhamnosus HN001 only during gestation and postpartum, without supplementation in the infant, does not reduce the infant's risk of developing atopic manifestations by 12 months of age when compared with placebo. This strain was not detected in breastmilk and did not alter breastmilk protein or cytokine concentrations, which might explain these disparate findings (98437).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCritical illness (trauma). Enteral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus does not seem to be beneficial for patients with critical illness.\nA large clinical trial in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation shows that giving L. rhamnosus GG 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) enterally twice daily for a median of 9 days and up to 60 days does not reduce the risk of developing ICU-acquired infections or diarrhea or alter mortality or length of stay when compared with placebo. Also, in 15 patients, L. rhamnosus GG was isolated from sterile sites, including the blood, peritoneal or pleural fluid, hepatic or intra-abdominal abscess, or urine. Death occurred in two cases (107499).\nless\nPeanut allergy. Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus does not seem to be beneficial for increasing the efficacy of peanut oral immunotherapy in children.\nClinical research in children aged 1-10 years with peanut allergy shows that taking L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103 20 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 18 months does not increase the efficacy of peanut oral immunotherapy in inducing desensitization or maintenance of sustained unresponsiveness to peanuts over the next 8 weeks. Taking L. rhamnosus decreased the number of gastrointestinal and respiratory adverse events; however, hypersensitivity and urticaria occurred more frequently in children aged 6-10 years taking L. rhamnosus (107525).\nless\nVentilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Most research shows that enteral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus does not prevent VAP and might increase the risk of L. rhamnosus infection.\nA large clinical trial in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation shows that giving L. rhamnosus GG 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) enterally twice daily for a median of 9 days and up to 60 days does not reduce the risk of developing VAP when compared with placebo. Also, in 15 patients, L. rhamnosus GG was isolated from sterile sites, including the blood, peritoneal or pleural fluid, hepatic or intra-abdominal abscess, or urine. Death occurred in two cases (107499). In contrast, a small clinical study in critically ill patients suggests that administering L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) 2 billion CFUs twice daily might reduce the incidence of VAP to 19%, compared with 40% in the placebo group. In this study, half of the dose was given onto the oropharynx and half via a nasogastric tube (17116).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAbdominal pain. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for abdominal pain.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in children 4-18 years old with functional abdominal pain shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG does not reduce abdominal pain when compared with placebo (105130).\nless\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline.\nIn healthy middle-aged and older adults, clinical research shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) 10 billion colony-forming units daily for 3 months does not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo. However, there was some benefit in a sub-group of individuals with cognitive impairment (105134).\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that drinking 250 mL of fermented milk containing L. rhamnosus GG 50 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 5 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 50 billion CFUs from 36 weeks' gestation until 3 months postpartum does not reduce the incidence of allergic rhinitis in the child at 6 years of age when compared with placebo milk (96893).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for ADHD prevention or treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this purpose.\nBacterial vaginosis. Oral and vaginal Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical trial shows that using vaginal capsules (EcoVag Vaginal Capsules, Bifodan A/S) containing L. rhamnosus and Lactobacillus gasseri, 100 million to 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of each strain per capsule, following conventional treatment for 10 days in three subsequent menstrual cycles, increases the time from cure to relapse when compared with placebo. However, cure rates were not significantly improved in the first month of treatment (16745).\n\nOral L. rhamnosus has also been evaluated. The available clinical research has investigated the use of a specific strain, GR-1 in combination with Limosilactobacillus reuteri RC-14. Some research suggests that this combination does not modify vaginal or fecal microbiota or improve cure or recurrence rates in patients also treated with metronidazole vaginally, when compared with taking placebo (111996, 111998). Doses in these studies included at least 1 billion CFUs daily of L. rhamnosus plus L. reuteri for 30 days in otherwise healthy premenopausal adults (111996) or 2 billion CFUs of L. rhamnosus and L. reuteri twice daily for 6 months in patients with HIV (111998). However, other clinical research in patients with bacterial vaginosis suggests that taking this combination of probiotics might be beneficial for improving cure rates and improving the vaginal microbiota. In these studies, cure rates increased from 40%-50% with placebo to approximately 88% with the L. rhamnosus and L. reuteri combination. In addition to a single dose of tinidazole 2 grams or metronidazole treatment, 2 billion CFUs each of L. rhamnosus and L. reuteri were used daily for about 1 month in these studies (111997, 112508). The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear but may be related to the differences in patient populations, geographical locations, and/or dosing of the product.\n\nThe effect of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14 for the prevention of bacterial vaginosis has also been investigated. One clinical study shows that taking capsules containing 2.5 billion CFUs of this combination daily from 9-14 weeks' gestation until delivery does not affect the rate of bacterial vaginosis when compared with placebo (102292). In patients with HIV treated with metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 10 days, taking 2 billion CFUs of L. rhamnosus and L. reuteri twice daily for 6 months does not improve the recurrence rates when compared with taking placebo (111998).\nless\nBipolar disorder. Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study shows that taking at least 100 million colony-forming units of a combination of L. rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 for 24 weeks after discharge from the hospital for mania reduces the time to first rehospitalization when compared with placebo. The hazard ratio for the first rehospitalization due to worsening of psychiatric symptoms was 0.37 for the combination probiotic group when compared with placebo. Among patients who were re-hospitalized, taking the combination probiotic reduced the mean duration of rehospitalization by 5.4 days when compared with placebo (96896).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for cancer prevention or treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nCanker sores. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for canker sore prevention or treatment.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of mainly small and preliminary clinical trials shows that oral lactobacilli have a small effect on pain from canker sores. However, only two studies in the analysis used L. rhamnosus. One individual study shows that taking L. rhamnosus Lcr35 1.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 3 months has no effect on the number of canker sores. Another small study shows that taking a combination of L. rhamnosus, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis reduces pain, but does not affect the number of lesions or healing time, when compared with placebo (105146). The individual studies were small and may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for preventing chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) 10-20 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily in two divided doses orally during 24 weeks of chemotherapy, with or without guar gum, reduces severe diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and the number of chemotherapy dose reductions required when compared with not taking L. rhamnosus GG (16736).\nless\nChild development. Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn 11-year follow-up study shows that taking L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis daily from 35 weeks' gestation until birth, or for six months after birth if breastfeeding, followed by supplementation of the child until two years of age, does not affect neurocognitive outcomes such as attention, intelligence, executive function, depression, and anxiety, when compared with placebo (102287).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus improves cognitive function in young adults.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking L. rhamnosus JB-1 as 1 billion colony-forming units daily for 4 weeks does not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo in healthy young adults (105148).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for cognitive impairment.\nIn middle-aged and older adults with cognitive impairment, a small clinical trial shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) 10 billion colony-forming units daily for 3 months results in an improved cognitive function score when compared with placebo (105134).\nless\nColic. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for colic.\nA small clinical trial in exclusively breastfed infants with colic shows that taking L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103 5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 28 days reduces full-force crying time by a median of 135 minutes when compared with taking placebo (112000). Other clinical research in infants aged 4-12 weeks with colic shows that taking a combination of L. rhamnosus and Limosilactobacillus reuteri (FloraActive) 250 million CFUs with fructo-oligosaccharides 3.33 mg and vitamin D3 200 IU daily for 28 days reduces mean crying time by 2.7 hours by the end of the study, compared to a 1.9-hour reduction in the vitamin D group (99783). However, another small clinical study in infants shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG 10 billion CFUs with inulin 225 mg daily starting within 4 days of birth does not prevent colic symptoms or diagnosis at 4 months when compared with inulin alone (112497). This study was a secondary analysis of a trial designed to investigate the effect of L. rhamnosus on atopic disease prevention.\nless\nCommon cold. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for preventing the common cold, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for constipation.\nA small clinical study in children less than 5 years old with functional constipation shows that taking L. rhamnosus Lcr35 800 million CFUs twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve stool frequency when compared with placebo (95340). However, a small clinical trial shows that taking a combination of L. rhamnosus IDCC 3201, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum IDCC 3501, Lacticaseibacillus casei IDCC 3451, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis IDCC 4301, Bifidobacterium breve IDCC 4401, Lactococcus lactis IDCC 2301, xylooligosaccharide, and dietary fiber as nondigestible maltodextrin, oat fiber, and psyllium husk fiber (ID-HWS1000) modestly increases stool frequency and improves symptoms of functional constipation in adults when compared with placebo (107517). It is unclear if these effects are due to L. rhamnosus, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for reducing symptoms of COVID-19, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for preventing Crohn disease recurrence.\nA small clinical trial in adults shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) 6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for one year does not prevent recurrence of Crohn disease after surgery (12767). Another small clinical trial in children and young adults shows that taking L. rhamnosus 10 billion CFUs twice daily for up to two years in addition to standard therapy does not prolong remission when compared with placebo (107539).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for cystic fibrosis.\nClinical research in children aged 2-16 years with cystic fibrosis shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG 6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 12 months does not reduce the odds of having at least one pulmonary exacerbation, the odds of hospitalization over 12 months, or the total number of exacerbations or hospitalizations when compared with placebo (107570).\nless\nDental caries. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for dental caries prevention.\nA large clinical trial in children aged 1-6 years shows that providing milk containing L. rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 (Gefilus, Valio Ltd., Riihimaki Dairy) five days a week for 7 months does not reduce the overall odds of developing dental caries when compared with placebo. However, there was a 44% reduction in caries odds when caries risk was taken into consideration. The milk provided at least 500,000 colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL, with each child consuming 42-584 mL daily (107571). However, a meta-analysis of this and other large clinical trials in preschool children shows that taking L. rhamnosus in juice or milk modestly reduces the incidence of dental caries and prevents tooth decay progression when compared with taking placebo (112507). The effect of L. rhamnosus added to milk has also been investigated in adults. Clinical research in middle-aged and older adults with at least two primary root caries lesions shows that taking L. rhamnosus LB21 200 million CFUs in milk, either alone or with added fluoride 5 ppm, once daily for 15 months modestly reduces lesion severity when compared with placebo milk. However, the milk containing L. rhamnosus in the absence of fluoride was less effective than either the combination or the milk containing fluoride only (107573). The validity of this study is limited by a dropout rate of 38%.\nless\nDental plaque. Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adolescent males aged 13-15 years with mild to moderate gingival inflammation shows that taking two lozenges containing L. rhamnosus GG (Probiotical SpA) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (Chr. Hansen A/S) twice daily for 4 weeks does not reduce plaque when compared with placebo. However, here was a benefit on levels of some salivary and plaque pathogenic bacteria. Each lozenge provided L. rhamnosus 440 million colony-forming units (CFUs) plus B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 480 million CFUs (107574).\n\nA small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking four lozenges daily providing a total daily dose of 2 billion CFUs each of L. rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 (Probiotical SpA) and B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 DSM 15954 (Chr. Hansen A/S) for 4 weeks modestly reduces plaque and gingivitis when compared with placebo (107572). Another small clinical trial in adults with moderate gingival inflammation shows that taking a tablet providing 50 million CFUs each of L. rhamnosus PB01 DSM 14869 and Latilactobacillus curvatus EB10 DSM 32307 twice daily after brushing for 4 weeks does not improve plaque or bleeding during probing when compared with placebo (107575).\nless\nDenture stomatitis. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for denture stomatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for treatment of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Oral L. rhamnosus is unlikely to be beneficial for the prevention of gestational diabetes and may actually increase the risk for other complications.\nOne small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a specific combination product (Familact probiotics, ZistTakhmir Co.) containing L. rhamnosus and other probiotic bacteria daily for 6 weeks does not reduce fasting blood glucose or plasma insulin when compared with placebo. This product contains L. rhamnosus 1.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus acidophilus 2 billion CFUs, Lacticaseibacillus casei 7 billion CFUs, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 200 million CFUs, Bifidobacterium breve 30 billion CFUs, Bifidobacterium longum 7 billion CFUs, and Streptococcus thermophilus 1.5 billion CFUs (99790).\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking lactobacilli, usually L. rhamnosus, during pregnancy is unlikely to PREVENT gestational diabetes and increases the relative risk of pre-eclampsia by 85% when compared with placebo (105185). Studies have used L. rhamnosus HN001 6 billion CFUs daily from 14-16 weeks' gestation to 24-30 weeks' gestation (96888), L. rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12) at least 1 billion CFUs daily from 16-20 weeks' gestation until 28 weeks' gestation, or L. rhamnosus HN001 ATCC SD5675 and B. animalis subsp. lactis 420 DSM 22089 (Dupont Nutrition & Health) 10 billion CFUs each daily throughout pregnancy, with or without fish oil (102284, 105144).\n\nLimited evidence has also assessed the effects of L. rhamnosus for type 2 diabetes. Taking L. rhamnosus 10 billion CFUs, L. acidophilus 1 billion CFUs, and Bacillus coagulans GanedenBC30 (GBI-30, 6086) 100 billion CFUs with fructo-oligosaccharides 500 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and insulin and improves measures of insulin resistance when compared with placebo (107536).\n\nSome research has also assessed the effects of L. rhamnosus in combination with other probiotics in children 8-17 years old with new onset type 1 diabetes. One clinical study shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb12 DSM 15954 1 billion CFUs daily for 6 months does not reduce insulin requirements or glycated hemoglobin over 12 months when compared with placebo. Additionally, C-peptide levels and the maintenance of residual pancreatic beta-cell function were not affected when compared with placebo (107518).\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of acute diarrhea.\nL. rhamnosus GG (e.g., Culturelle) 6 billion CFUs twice daily, given prophylactically at hospital admission, seems to reduce the risk of non-rotaviral diarrhea in infants and children ages 1-36 months (7741). Furthermore, giving 37 billion CFUs of this strain daily, 6 days weekly for 15 months, can reduce the occurrence of diarrhea from all causes in undernourished children aged 6-24 months (4373). However, in older adults in long-term care, taking a combination of L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12) 13-16 billion CFUs daily does not reduce the incidence or duration of diarrhea over a 12-month period when compared with placebo (103425).\n\nA small clinical study in children with dysentery being treated with ceftriaxone shows that taking a specific combination probiotic sachet (Kidilact, Zisttakhmir Company) containing L. rhamnosus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium breve, and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 5 days modestly reduces the duration of diarrhea, hospitalization, and blood in diarrhea when compared with control (102417).\n\nL. rhamnosus has yielded inconsistent results in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis, which is defined as three or more episodes of watery stools per day, with or without vomiting, for fewer than 3-7 days. While the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388), both guidelines note that most evidence is low quality. Furthermore, these guidelines were published prior to the completion of the recent high-quality studies showing no benefit with L. rhamnosus GG, alone or in combination with Lactobacillus helveticus (98427, 98428, 103441, 110925). These studies in children 3 months to 4 years of age with acute gastroenteritis show that taking either L. rhamnosus GG (e.g., Culturelle) 1 billion CFUs or a combination product containing L. rhamnosus GG 3.8 billion CFUs and L. helveticus 200 million CFUs twice daily for 5 days does not reduce the risk of a moderate to severe episode of acute gastroenteritis in the 14-28 days after starting the probiotic when compared with placebo (98427, 98428, 103441, 110925). These products also did not reduce the incidence or severity of diarrhea or vomiting, the number of unexpected healthcare visits (98427, 98428, 103441, 110925), the number of day care days missed, or the rate of household transmission (98427) when compared with placebo, regardless of the causative pathogen. Additional clinical research shows that treatment with L. rhamnosus GG 1 billion CFUs twice daily for 5 days does not reduce the severity or duration of diarrhea in otherwise healthy children 6 months to 6 years of age (90280).\nless\nGingivitis. Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adolescent males aged 13-15 years with mild to moderate gingival inflammation shows that taking two lozenges containing L. rhamnosus GG (Probiotical SpA) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (Chr. Hansen A/S) twice daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces gingivitis when compared with placebo. Each lozenge provided L. rhamnosus 440 million colony-forming units (CFUs) plus B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 480 million CFUs (107574).\n\nA small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking four lozenges daily providing a total daily dose of 2 billion CFUs each of L. rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 (Probiotical SpA) and B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 DSM 15954 (Chr. Hansen A/S) for 4 weeks modestly reduces plaque and gingivitis when compared with placebo (107572). However, a small clinical trial in adults with moderate gingival inflammation shows that taking a tablet providing 50 million CFUs each of L. rhamnosus PB01 DSM 14869 and Latilactobacillus curvatus EB10 DSM 32307 twice daily after brushing for 4 weeks does not improve plaque or bleeding with probing when compared with placebo (107575).\nless\nGroup B streptococcal colonization. Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of two clinical trials shows that taking L. rhamnosus GR-1 and Limosilactobacillus reuteri RC-14, starting at 35-37 weeks' gestation and continuing until delivery, does not improve GBS clearance during pregnancy. However, a well-designed study included in this analysis shows that taking 4 billion CFUs daily more than doubles the number of patients testing negative for GBS at delivery (105165). In addition, a small clinical trial shows that taking this combination as 2.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each daily for 12 weeks, starting at weeks 23-25 of gestation, does not prevent the rate of GBS vaginal/rectal colonization at 35-37 weeks' gestation (107567).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus in combination with standard therapies for H. pylori can improve eradication rates or reduce the risk of adverse effects; the available research is conflicting.\nMost clinical research in adults has shown that L. rhamnosus does not improve H. pylori eradication rates when used in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Streptococcus faecium and taken with triple therapy consisting of furazolidone, tetracycline, and lansoprazole (90279), when used in combination with six other probiotics species and taken with bismuth quadruple therapy (90291), or when L. rhamnosus GG is used with triple therapy consisting of rabeprazole, clarithromycin, and tinidazole (12763). However, a large, more recent study shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG in combination with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactic BB-12 (Normia, JGL; Christian Hanssen) twice daily for 14 days with triple therapy results in eradication in 87% of patients, compared with 73% of those taking triple therapy and placebo (107514).\n\nL. rhamnosus has also been evaluated for reducing the risk of adverse effects from H. pylori treatment. In two studies in which L. rhamnosus is taken along with other probiotics, the rate of adverse effects is not reduced when compared with placebo (90279, 90291). However, when L. rhamnosus GG is used alone, or in combination with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12, triple therapy-related adverse effects are modestly reduced when compared with placebo (12763, 107514). There was no longer a difference in adverse events between probiotic therapy and placebo during the 2-4 weeks of follow up (12763).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nHypercholesterolemia. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for hypercholesterolemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for IBS; the available research is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that L. rhamnosus reduces abdominal pain, but does not improve the frequency of pain relief, in patients with IBS (107594). In contrast, a small clinical trial shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG 10 billion CFUs daily for 8 weeks does not improve symptoms of IBS (12771).\n\nL. rhamnosus has also been evaluated in combination with other probiotics. Clinical research shows that taking a product (Duolac Care) containing L. rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium animalis susbp. lactis, Bifidobacterium breve, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and Streptococcus thermophilus twice daily for 4 weeks can relieve symptoms in 72% of patients with IBS (95353). A clinical study in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) shows that taking a specific multi-species probiotic (NordBiotic, MBM Biotix) containing L. rhamnosus LR110, L. acidophilus LA120, L. plantarum LP140, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LPC100, Lacticaseibacillus casei LC130, B. breve BB010, Bifidobacterium longum BL020, Bifidobacterium bifidum BF030, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL040, and Streptococcus thermophilus ST250 as 2.5 billion CFUs total twice daily for 8 weeks improves overall symptom severity, as well as pain severity, pain frequency, and quality of life, when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was rated as mild by approximately 60% of those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 30% of those taking placebo (107516). However, other clinical research shows that taking a combination of L. rhamnosus CLR2, L. acidophilus CL1285, and L. casei LBC80R 50 billion CFUs each daily for 3 months does not improve symptoms of IBS in the whole study population, although it may have some benefit in specific sub-groups (99789).\nless\nLactose intolerance. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for lactose intolerance.\nIn patients with persistent symptoms related to lactose intolerance despite a lactose-free diet, a small clinical trial shows that taking a combination product (Zircombi) containing L. rhamnosus HN001 1 billion CFUs, Bifidobacterium longum BB536 4 billion CFUs, and vitamin B6 1.4 mg daily for 30 days modestly improves symptoms of bloating and constipation, but not abdominal pain, when compared with placebo (105153).\nless\nMalnourishment-related diarrhea. Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in children aged 6 months to 4 years of age hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition shows that taking L. rhamnosus LGG and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 5 billion colony-forming units each daily during hospitalization and for 8-12 weeks as an outpatient does not affect diarrhea incidence or severity or the number of days with diarrhea during hospitalization. However, the number of days with diarrhea as an outpatient was reduced by 2.2 days (110996).\nless\nMalnutrition. Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in children aged 6 months to 4 years of age hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition shows that taking L. rhamnosus LGG and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 5 billion colony-forming units each daily during hospitalization and for 8-12 weeks as an outpatient does not affect pneumonia incidence, duration, or severity, weight gain, duration of hospitalization, or other outcomes (110996).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for metabolic syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial or safe for NEC prevention.\nMost meta-analyses of clinical research show that giving lactobacilli enterally reduces the risk of NEC and/or severe NEC in preterm, mainly very low birth weight (VLBW), infants. Some meta-analyses support the use of lactobacilli in combination with bifidobacteria, as opposed to lactobacilli alone for reducing the risk of NEC (95344, 95351, 103437, 103445, 104157, 105162, 105164). However, research on the use of L. rhamnosus, specifically, is limited. Large retrospective reports suggest that taking L. rhamnosus GG does not significantly reduce the risk of NEC in preterm, VLBW infants. The most recent report suggests that the use of L. rhamnosus is associated with an almost 2-fold increased incidence of NEC when compared with not using L. rhamnosus (17121, 112501). Also, guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies with respect to the use of probiotics in very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in this group of infants (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608). The Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that probiotic combinations may be of benefit in reducing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates over 1000 grams. However, L. rhamnosus is not specifically recommended (103003, 111609, 111611).\nless\nNeurogenic bladder. Although there has been interest in using intravesical Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for reducing urinary symptoms associated with neurogenic bladder, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this purpose.\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn children with NAFLD, clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (Prokid, Gostaresh Milad Pouya Company) containing L. rhamnosus DSMZ 21690 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC B3208 3 billion CFUs, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSMZ 32269 6 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC SD6576 2 billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks normalizes liver sonography findings in 53% of children, compared with 17% of those taking placebo. In addition, levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are reduced by 30% and 25%, respectively. There was no effect on body mass index or blood lipids when compared with placebo (105156).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for weight loss.\nClinical research in adults with obesity shows that taking L. rhamnosus 162 million colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for 24 weeks does not reduce body weight or fat mass when compared with placebo. However, when only females are considered, L. rhamnosus seems to reduce body weight by an additional 1.8 kg when compared with placebo (90289). Another clinical trial shows that taking 10 billion CFUs each of L. rhamnosus HN001 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420 daily during pregnancy and for 6 months postpartum, alone or with 2 capsules daily of fish oil (Croda Europe Ltd.), reduces the odds of the infant being overweight at 24 months by at least 78% when compared with taking placebo (110336). It is unclear if this effect is related to L. rhamnosus, B. lactis, or their combination.\nless\nOropharyngeal candidiasis. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for oropharyngeal candidiasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nOsteoarthritis. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for osteoarthritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nOtitis media. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for preventing otitis media in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 1-6 years who attend daycare shows that taking milk containing L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) does not reduce the incidence of otitis media infections when compared with placebo (8565).\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for periodontitis.\nA meta-analysis of 2 small clinical trials in patients with periodontitis shows that using oral L. rhamnosus as an adjunctive therapy to scaling and root planing does not improve clinical attachment or reduce probing pocket depth when compared with control (107622). Similarly, a small clinical trial in patients with stage III periodontitis following scaling and root planing shows that taking L. rhamnosus SP1 (Macrofood S.A.) as 20 million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 3 months does not improve plaque, probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, or clinical attachment, when compared with placebo (107576). However, all studies were small and might not have been adequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for PCOS.\nA small clinical trial in overweight or obese patients with PCOS who are consuming an energy-restricted diet shows that taking L. rhamnosus 12 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 20 weeks does not increase weight loss or have beneficial effects on blood lipid levels when compared with placebo (107577). However, this study was small and may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Another clinical trial shows that 31.3% of patients with PCOS taking L. rhamnosus in combination with other probiotics daily for 6 months had regular menstrual cycles compared with 12.5% of those taking placebo. There were also modest improvements in testosterone levels and waist circumference, but not other hormones, insulin resistance, body weight, or most measures of quality of life. The product provided L. rhamnosus UBLR-58 2 billion CFUs along with Bifidobacterium bifidum UBBB-55, Lactobacillus acidophilus UBLA-34, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UBLP-40, Lacticaseibacillus casei UBLC-42, Limosilactobacillus fermentum UBLF-31, Limosilactobacillus reuteri UBLRu-87, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) daily for 2 months and then twice daily for 4 months. All patients also underwent dietary and lifestyle changes (110974). It is unclear if any benefits are due to L. rhamnosus, the other probiotics, or their combination.\nless\nPostoperative bowel function. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for improving postoperative bowel function.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG (Dicoflor 60, Vitis pharma, Warsaw, Poland) 6 million colony-forming units twice daily for 30 days following major pancreatic surgery reduces the time to first passing gas and stool, by about 1.1 and 2 days, respectively, when compared with receiving standard nutrition only (112495).\nless\nPostoperative infection. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for preventing postoperative infections.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG (Dicoflor 60, Vitis pharma, Warsaw, Poland) 6 million colony-forming units twice daily for 30 days following major pancreatic surgery does not reduce the incidence of postoperative infections when compared with receiving standard nutrition only (112495).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for improving postoperative recovery.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG (Dicoflor 60, Vitis pharma, Warsaw, Poland) 6 million colony-forming units twice daily for 30 days following major pancreatic surgery reduces the length of hospital stay by 2 days when compared with receiving standard nutrition only (112495).\nless\nPostpartum depression. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for postpartum depression.\nClinical research shows that taking L. rhamnosus HN001 6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily from 14-16 weeks' gestation does not reduce the rate of clinically significant depression when compared with placebo. However, taking this product modestly reduces feelings of postpartum depression and anxiety, and 47% fewer patients experienced clinically significant anxiety between 1-2 months' postpartum when compared with placebo (107541). Other clinical research shows that taking a combination of L. rhamnosus HN001 ATCC SD5675 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420 DSM 22,089 (Dupont Nutrition & Health) 10 billion CFUs daily, alone or with fish oil providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0.44 grams and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 3.8 grams daily, does not reduce symptoms of postpartum depression or anxiety when compared with placebo. Supplements were started in the second trimester of pregnancy and continued until 6 months after delivery (107496).\nless\nPouchitis. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for pouchitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for respiratory tract infections; the available research is conflicting.\nThe evidence related to the use of L. rhamnosus for respiratory tract infections is mixed. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that administering L. rhamnosus GG to infants and children reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) by about 38%. However, this analysis shows that giving this strain to infants and children does not reduce the risk of overall respiratory infections or the risk of lower respiratory tract infections (95347). Also, the evidence from individual clinical trials is mixed. One large clinical trial shows that children ages 1-6 years who attend daycare centers get fewer and less severe respiratory infections when given approximately 260 mL milk daily containing L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) 0.5-1 million colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL (8565). However, other clinical research in infants aged 6 to 12 months shows that taking L. rhamnosus HN001 one million colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram of follow-on formula daily for 12 weeks does not reduce the incidence of confirmed or parentally reported upper respiratory tract infections when compared with formula without added probiotics. Infants consumed an average of 141 grams of formula daily (110988). Also, a large clinical trial in children aged 2-6 years shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG 1 billion CFUs daily for 16 weeks does not reduce the incidence of physician-diagnosed URTIs when compared with taking placebo. There was also no difference in the number of children, days, or days absent with a URTI (112492).\n\nL. rhamnosus has also been investigated in combination with other probiotics. In college students, clinical research shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12 one billion CFUs each daily for 12 weeks reduces the duration of upper respiratory tract infection by about 2 days when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was reduced by 34%. There was also a small reduction in the number of missed school days, but not work days (110993). Conversely, in older adults in long-term care, taking a combination of L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12) 13-16 billion CFUs daily does not reduce the incidence of upper or lower respiratory tract infections when compared with placebo over a 12-month period, and actually increases the use of antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections by 2.2 days (103425).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for RA.\nA small clinical trial in patients with RA shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 (Gefilus, Valio Ltd.) 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for 12 months does not reduce symptoms when compared with placebo (107533). An additional small clinical trial shows that taking a total of 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily of a combination of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and Limosilactobacillus reuteri RC-14 (Chr Hansen) for 14 weeks does not improve symptom severity when compared with placebo (107569). Both studies were small and may not have been adequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for rotaviral diarrhea.\nSome meta-analyses of clinical research and several small clinical trials show that L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) can reduce the duration of diarrhea in infants and children with rotavirus infection (1253, 4369, 4377, 8568, 112504). These studies were conducted prior to the availability of the rotavirus vaccine. Conversely, large, high-quality studies conducted after the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine do not show benefits (98427, 98428, 112504). Clinical research in children 3 months to 4 years of age with acute gastroenteritis, including rotaviral gastroenteritis, shows that taking either L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) or a combination product containing L. rhamnosus GG 3.8 billion CFUs and Lactobacillus helveticus 200 million CFUs twice daily for 5 days does not reduce the risk of a moderate to severe episode of acute gastroenteritis in the 14 days after starting the probiotic when compared with placebo (98427, 98428, 110925). Taking these probiotic products also does not reduce the incidence or severity of diarrhea or vomiting, the number of unexpected healthcare visits (98427, 98428, 110925), the number of daycare days missed, the rate of household transmission (98427), or the pathogen load (103441) when compared with placebo. Approximately 48% to 65% of the children enrolled in these studies were vaccinated against rotavirus, but it is not clear if this altered the study outcomes (98427, 98428, 103441). More research is needed to evaluate the effect of lactobacillus in the treatment of rotaviral diarrhea in children who have not been vaccinated against rotavirus.\n\nAlthough L. rhamnosus GG and other species have shown modest benefit in preliminary clinical studies in children who have not received the rotavirus vaccine, the evidence is conflicting, and not all of the evaluated patients had confirmed rotavirus infection (102295). The current guidelines related to the treatment of viral diarrhea are also conflicting. While the World Gastroenterology Organization has not made a recommendation (98471), the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388). However, these guidelines note that most evidence is low quality and is not specific to rotavirus infection. Furthermore, these guidelines were released prior to the publication of the most recent, high-quality studies showing no benefit with the use of L. rhamnosus (98427, 98428). Recent guidelines by the American Gastroenterology Association conditionally recommend against the use of probiotics for the treatment of acute infectious gastroenteritis in children (103003).\nless\nShort bowel syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for short bowel syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for SIBO, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nStress. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG is beneficial for stress.\nPreliminary clinical research in university students shows that taking L. rhamnosus HN001 6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 8-13 weeks during the semester does not reduce stress or anxiety during exams when compared with taking placebo (112496).\nless\nTravelers' diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG is beneficial for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea; the available research is conflicting.\nClinical research shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG (Culturelle) 2 billion colony-forming units daily orally, starting two days prior to a trip and continuing until the end of the trip, seems to reduce the occurrence of diarrhea in child and adult travelers (4374, 10216). However, a meta-analysis which included two small clinical studies evaluating the use of L. rhamnosus GG in adults traveling to different parts of the world found no benefit for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea when compared with placebo (101445). The effectiveness of this strain can vary significantly based upon the destination of travel. Destinations in the same country can have different results, probably due to differences in bacteria and other microorganisms at different locations (10216).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Although there has been interest in using oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for ulcerative colitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. rhamnosus for this condition.\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral or intravaginal Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of UTIs.\nSome small clinical studies show that intravaginal use of L. rhamnosus might provide modest benefit for preventing UTI (6094, 6095). These trials used suppositories containing 0.5 gram (1.6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs)) of L. rhamnosus and Limosilactobacillus fermentum twice weekly for 2 weeks, then once a month for 2 months (6095) or a vaginal solution containing L. rhamnosus 100 billion viable bacteria/mL in a dose of 1 mL twice weekly (6094). However, some research indicates that L. rhamnosus is ineffective in establishing vaginal colonization, regardless of the route of administration (90257). This may explain why studies which have evaluated the use of L. rhamnosus as a single agent for this indication have failed to show benefit (4581).\n\nOral L. rhamnosus has also been evaluated for the prevention of UTI recurrence. Clinical research in postmenopausal adults shows that an oral combination of L. rhamnosus GR-1 and Limosilactobacillus reuteri RC-14, standardized to at least 1 billion CFUs and taken twice daily for 12 months, demonstrates similar efficacy to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 480 mg once daily for reducing the number of symptomatic UTIs. Although this combination was not associated with the increase in antimicrobial resistance that occurred with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, the antibiotic delayed the median time to first recurrence by two-fold and reduced the number of confirmed microbiological infections when compared with lactobacillus (90235). In children aged 4 months to 5 years with a previous UTI, clinical research shows that taking a specific combination (Complete Probiotic Platinum) of L. rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis for 18 months increases the median time to the first incidence of recurrence by approximately 3 months and increases the percentage of children without a UTI during the study period from 83% to 97% (103436). However, in older adults in long-term care, taking a combination of L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12) 13-16 billion CFUs daily does not reduce the incidence of UTI when compared with placebo over a 12-month period (103425).\nless\nVaginal candidiasis. It is unclear if oral or intravaginal Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of vaginal candidiasis.\nA combination of L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium longum (Lactobac) given orally, or a combination of L. rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (Femilac) given intravaginally, does not seem to reduce the risk of vaginal candidiasis infection following use of antibiotics (12108). However, there is preliminary evidence that individuals with candidiasis who use intravaginal suppositories containing 1 billion colony-forming units of L. rhamnosus GG twice daily for 7 days in combination with conventional treatment might have subjective improvement in symptoms (4397).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection. It is unclear if oral Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is beneficial for the prevention of C. difficile infection.\nObservational research has found that providing a specific combination (Bio-K+ 50 Billion; Bio-K Plus International) of L. rhamnosus CLR2, Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285, and Lacticaseibacillus casei LBC80R, as 50-100 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 5 days to patients who are on antibiotics for at least 2 days reduces the hospital-wide incidence of C. difficile by approximately 40%. The incidence rate was decreased by at least 50% in the highest risk individuals taking this combination (107529). Conversely, individual clinical studies included in some meta-analyses suggest that L. rhamnosus is not effective for the primary prevention of C. difficile infections; however, the number of patients with C. difficile in the individual studies is likely too small for an adequate comparison (14334, 90231). Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) state that there is insufficient information to recommend administration of probiotics for the primary prevention of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (107538).\n\nWhile some preliminary clinical research shows that taking L. rhamnosus GG might reduce the risk of C. difficile diarrhea recurrence (4392, 4394), meta-analyses of more recent, higher-quality clinical data show that this strain is not effective for this purpose (14334, 18088, 90934, 95368, 95370).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus for these uses.",

In one case, an 11-month-old infant with short bowel syndrome developed bacteremia after receiving L. rhamnosus for 5 weeks through a gastrostomy tube for rotaviral diarrhea (13070). This may have been due to impaired gut integrity. Additionally, three cases of bacteremia caused by L. rhamnosus GG have been reported in adults and adolescent patients with severe active ulcerative colitis (i.e. those who require hospitalization and intravenous corticosteroids) (95366). In one case, a male with moderately severe ulcerative colitis developed L. rhamnosus sepsis while taking probiotics containing L. rhamnosus. This patient also had a bioprosthetic aortic valve and had just finished a 2.5-month course of oral prednisone (112505).\nless\nIMMUNODEFICIENCY\nLacticaseibacillus rhamnosus preparations might cause pathogenic colonization in patients who are severely immunocompromised (4380, 4391, 4393, 4398, 103444, 112505).\nless\nVALVULAR HEART DISEASE\nTheoretically, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus preparations might cause pathogenic colonization in patients with valvular heart disease. Use should be avoided prior to dental surgery or other invasive gastrointestinal procedures.

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen taken orally, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Some preparations of L. rhamnosus may behave as probiotics and colonize the large bowel (90605, 112000).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is a species of lactic acid-producing, Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. L. rhamnosus is found in the gastrointestinal tract and vagina, as well as in various fermented foods. Specific strains of L. rhamnosus are found as probiotics in supplements and functional foods (90605, 101513).\n\nL. rhamnosus is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605). Most researchers agree that the effectiveness of L. rhamnosus and other probiotics for all indications depends on its ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAlcohol metabolism effects\nIn human research, consuming milk containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 1.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) prior to drinking five glasses of beer reduces flushing and levels of acetaldehyde in the blood and saliva. This suggests that L. rhamnosus helps with alcohol metabolism (107502).\nAntibacterial effects\nThere is some preliminary research that suggests that Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is able to reduce adherence of pathogenic bacteria to the colonic mucosa, and to reduce bacterial translocation, which might be beneficial in the prevention of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (17116). L. rhamnosus GG has been used to reduce travelers' diarrhea. However, effectiveness seems to depend on the location of travel (4374, 10216). There has been interest in whether L. rhamnosus GG can prevent the colonization of the gut with multi-drug resistant bacteria during travel. However, results have been negative. A preliminary clinical study in Danish travelers shows that taking a specific product (Dicoflor) containing 6 billion colony-forming units twice daily during travel to India does not prevent colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (99781).\nAntibiotic adverse effect prevention\nIt is theorized that taking probiotics during antibiotic treatment can prevent or minimize normal flora depletion and pathogenic bacteria colonization. There is some evidence to support this theory (5500, 11382). When probiotic lactobacilli latch on to and colonize the intestinal and urogenital mucosa, it seems to prevent epithelial attachment by pathogenic bacteria (4369, 4378, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092). Lactobacilli seem to have this effect by increasing epithelial mucus production and competing with pathogens for mucosal binding sites, possibly through steric hindrance (4388, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092, 7755). Lactobacilli also inhibit bacterial pathogens by producing lactic acid, and some lactobacilli also produce hydrogen peroxide (6089, 6090, 6096). There is some evidence that Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG attaches to intestinal epithelial cells better than Lactobacillus acidophilus (4373). L. rhamnosus GG colonizes the gastrointestinal tract for up to 7 days after intake in some people (4367). If taken during pregnancy, L. rhamnosus GG remains in the infant's stool for up to 6 months (90247). However, strains of the same species might not act similarly at the same site. L. rhamnosus GR-1 seems to have anti-yeast and antiviral effects in the vagina that persist for at least 14 days after vaginal administration, while the effects of L. rhamnosus GG appear to diminish quickly (8560).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is some preliminary evidence that Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus might help protect against cancer. In animal models, the strains GG and LC-705 have been shown to bind the dietary carcinogen aflatoxin B1 (4376). L. rhamnosus GG has also been shown to decrease the development of tumors in the colon after carcinogen challenge (4382).\nDental effects\nThere is interest in using Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus and other probiotics for preventing dental caries by decreasing oral colonization by pathogenic bacteria. But consuming a L. rhamnosus GG-containing juice product (Gelifus, Valio) does not seem to result in beneficial oral colonization by L. rhamnosus GG (14346). Laboratory research does suggest that L. rhamnosus GG milk products might be useful as a vehicle for antibodies against human cariogenic bacteria (11380).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSome researchers think probiotics might have immunomodulating effects (4368, 4369, 8512). Lactobacilli seem to modulate non-specific cellular and humoral immunity possibly by stimulating lymphocyte and macrophage activity (6089, 8565) and modulating cytokine production by mononuclear cells (4379, 8512, 105137). They also seem to decrease markers of hypersensitivity reactions and intestinal inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (4369, 11383). Some lactobacilli also seem to stimulate the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which protects against allergy (7743). In atopic dermatitis, lactobacilli might reduce serum levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL27 which attract T-cells to the skin (17117). They also appear to enhance synthesis of antibodies in response to microbial pathogens, particularly secretory immunoglobulin A (7754, 105137).\n\nClinical research suggests that Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus taken orally might enhance natural immunity in healthy adults. It appears to increase the phagocytic activity in polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes, and enhance natural killer cell tumor killing activity (7756, 7757). However, the way L. rhamnosus affects immune function may differ depending on the health status of the patient. In people with immune system hypersensitivity, it seems to down-regulate immune function. In healthy people without immune system hypersensitivity, L. rhamnosus seems to stimulate the immune system (4399). Also, in older individuals in care homes, a combination of L. rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 for up to 12 months had no effect on blood count, immune cell phenotypes, immune mediator concentrations, or phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes. There was also no effect on the response to most vaccinations, although there was an increased response to the seasonal influenza vaccine (107519).\n\nAnimal research suggests that some strains of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus and Lacticaseibacillus casei affect the maturity of the epithelial gut barrier. They seem to activate the proteins zonulin and occluding, which play a role in the functions of cellular junctions in the intestinal lining. These strains might also activate gut secretory IgA and activate regulatory T cells (107510).\nRenal effects\nClinical research suggests that Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus taken orally might enhance renal health in patients with chronic kidney disease. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, taking L. rhamnosus for 4 weeks modestly reduces serum levels of the uremic toxins p-cresol and phenol (112498)."

            "Overview": "Lactiplantibacillus pentosus is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. It is found naturally in humans. Specific strains are found as probiotics in supplements and functional foods. Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605, 101513, 110910, 110911, 110912, 110914, 110915).",

L. pentosus, which was previously classified under the Lactobacillus genus, was reclassified under the Lactiplantibacillus genus. However, some product labels may still identify this species as Lactobacillus pentosus.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, there is no evidence that L. pentosus is beneficial for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLactiplantibacillus pentosus is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. It is found naturally in humans, as well as in some fermented foods. L. pentosus is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605, 101513, 110910, 110911, 110912, 110914, 110915). Most researchers agree that the effectiveness of L. pentosus and other probiotics for all indications depends on its ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAnti-bacterial effects\nLactiplantibacillus pentosus is of interest for Helicobacter pylori infections. In vitro, L. pentosus SLC13 has shown general anti-bacterial effects possibly related to the production of bacteriocins. This strain has been shown to inhibit H. pylori growth and adhesion, as well as the production of inflammatory cytokines (110911). Other in vitro research suggests that the cell-free supernatant of L. pentosus LPS16, but not L. pentosus LPS16 itself, inhibits H. pylori growth. The mechanism of action was found to be related to the production of lactic acid by this L. pentosus (110913).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLipopolysaccharide-associated gut inflammation and impaired barrier function is thought to play a role in the development of metabolic disorders including impaired glucose tolerance and obesity. In a high-fat diet animal model, heat-killed Lactiplantibacillus pentosus S-PT84 maintained gut integrity and inhibited systemic inflammatory responses, resulting in beneficial effects on adipose tissue responses and some lipid and glycemic indices (110912).\nImmunological effects\nSome researchers think probiotics might have immunomodulating effects (4368, 4369, 8512). Animal research suggests that Lactiplantibacillus pentosus has immune modulating effects in models of atopic dermatitis. However, in most children with atopic dermatitis, L. pentosus does not reduce overall symptom severity or the use of topical steroids. Although there was a small beneficial effect on itching severity in children with Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized atopic dermatitis, blood eosinophil counts, cytokine levels, and IgE levels were not affected (110910).\n\nLaboratory research suggests that heat-killed and viable L. pentosus b240 induce IgA (110914, 110915, 110916). In older adults, taking 4 billion heat-killed L. pentosus b240 cells daily for 12 weeks increases salivary IgA levels, suggesting beneficial effects on mucosal immunity (110916)."

It has been used medicinally for thousands of years, and for gastrointestinal decontamination for over 100 years (12396, 93613). Charcoal is activated by increasing the number of pores, thus increasing the surface area. This is achieved by heating to a high temperature in the presence of steam or carbon dioxide, or with an activating agent such as phosphoric acid or zinc chloride (12392). In foods, activated charcoal is sometimes used as a black food coloring.",

Constipation appears to be the most frequent complaint, but is typically transient. Black stools, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence have also been reported (12392, 12398, 93611, 103193). Rarely, activated charcoal may lead to gastrointestinal obstruction (12392).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nRarely, pulmonary aspiration has been reported in patients taking activated charcoal orally. This may happen if activated charcoal is regurgitated or if a misplaced nasogastric tube delivers activated charcoal to the lungs rather than the stomach (12392).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nPoisoning. Oral activated charcoal taken after ingestion of certain drugs reduces systemic drug exposure. However, it is unclear if it affects clinical endpoints such as morbidity or mortality.\nTaking activated charcoal orally appears to be effective when used as part of standard treatment for some, but not all, acute poisonings (12392, 12393, 93198, 93606, 93607, 93613, 94730). Single doses of activated charcoal, 25-100 grams in adults (10-50 grams in children, depending on age), are effective for preventing absorption of some drugs, including acetaminophen, aminophylline, amiodarone, aspirin, atenolol, carbamazepine, digoxin, fluoxetine, indomethacin, phenytoin, valproate, and verapamil, especially if taken within one hour of ingestion (93602, 93610, 93612, 93613, 94730, 108852). A single dose reduces drug exposure by 38% to 52% when given within 1 hour, by 21% to 35% when given 2-4 hours after ingestion, and by about 14% when given 6 hours after ingestion. These late effects, occurring after oral absorption is complete, are due to enhanced elimination via interruption of enterohepatic circulation and binding of drug that has been actively or passively transported back into the gastrointestinal tract (105543).\n\nMultiple-dose activated charcoal, 50-100 grams initially followed by doses of 25 grams every 2 hours or 50 grams every 4 hours, or 10-25 grams per dose in children, is recommended for patients who ingest life-threatening amounts of carbamazepine, dapsone, phenobarbital, quinine, or theophylline. This is based on clinical, animal, and in vitro research showing increased elimination of these drugs (12392, 105543). This increased elimination can also reduce levels of drugs that have been given intravenously, with the median half-life being decreased by an average of 45% and the median area under the concentration/time curve (AUC) by an average of 47% (105543). Additional research suggests that multiple-dose activated charcoal may be useful for increasing the elimination of amitriptyline, digoxin, imipramine, moxifloxacin, nadolol, phenytoin, piroxicam, and sotalol. Evidence supporting the use of multiple-dose activated charcoal in aspirin, doxepin, tobramycin, valproate, or vancomycin overdose is limited or conflicting (12392, 105543).\n\nWhile activated charcoal may reduce absorption of some toxic agents, there is contradictory evidence about whether it improves clinical outcomes (12392, 93200, 93601, 93613, 94730). Administering activated charcoal 50 grams every 6 hours for carbamazepine poisoning decreases the duration of coma by 9 hours, the duration of mechanical ventilation by 12 hours, and the length of hospital stay by 9 hours. However, activated charcoal does not reduce the duration of hospitalization, intensive care admission, vomiting, or mortality when compared with control after oral overdose of benzodiazepines, acetaminophen, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (93200). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with phenytoin toxicity shows that taking activated charcoal 50 grams orally every 4 hours reduces the time to return to therapeutic levels by about 22 hours when compared with control, but without reducing symptoms (93609). In patients with pesticide or yellow oleander seed toxicity, neither single-dose nor multi-dose regimens of activated charcoal reduce mortality, seizures, or the need for intubation when compared with control (93601).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCeliac disease. Although there is interest in using activated charcoal for acute gluten exposure in those with celiac disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of activated charcoal for this purpose.\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral activated charcoal is beneficial in patients with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.\nPreliminary clinical research in children treated with irinotecan shows that taking activated charcoal 250 mg the night before the first infusion and every 8 hours thereafter until the end of the cycle reduces the risk of diarrhea by 60% when compared with no treatment. Activated charcoal also appears to reduce the risk of severe diarrhea by 92% and to decrease chemotherapy discontinuation by 87% in these patients (93608).\nless\nCholestasis. It is unclear if oral activated charcoal is beneficial in patients with pregnancy-induced cholestasis.\nPreliminary clinical research in pregnant patients with cholestasis shows that taking activated charcoal 50 grams orally three times daily for 8 days decreases bile acid levels by about 50%, compared with an increase in those not taking activated charcoal. However, itching was not significantly improved with activated charcoal when compared with control (126).\nless\nConstipation. Oral activated charcoal has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone are unclear.\nA clinical study in patients with chronic constipation shows that a specific combination product (Nucarb; Wilshire Laboratories Ltd) containing activated charcoal 180 mg, calcium sennosides 50 mg, peppermint oil 0.5 mg, fennel oil 0.5 mg, rhubarb extract 250 mg, and sulfur 50 mg, taken as two tablets at bedtime for one week, followed by 1 tablet at bedtime for 1 week, reduces passing gas, abdominal pain, and sensation of bloating by 81%, 73%, and 72% respectively, when compared with baseline. Sensation of straining, severity of constipation, and feeling of incomplete evacuation were reduced by 69%, 67%, and 54% respectively, when compared with baseline (108853). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDyspepsia. Oral activated charcoal has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with functional dyspepsia shows that taking a specific combination product containing activated charcoal 280 mg, simethicone 90 mg, and magnesium oxide 180 mg (Carbosymag, Laboratoires Grimberg) three times daily for one month reduces symptoms of dyspepsia, such as postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, and abdominal bloating, when compared with placebo (93199). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with dyspepsia shows that taking another specific combination product containing activated charcoal 280 mg and simethicone 90 mg (Carbosylane, Laboratoires Grimberg) three times daily for 3 months does not improve overall symptoms of dyspepsia or nausea, but does improve abdominal fullness by 20%, bloating by 20%, and slow digestion by 30%, when compared with placebo (93604).\nless\nFlatulence. It is unclear if oral activated charcoal is beneficial for reducing the occurrence of flatulence.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking activated charcoal (Requa Charcocaps) 582 mg after a gas-producing meal significantly decreases the number of flatus events when compared with placebo. On average, subjects taking activated charcoal reported less than 3 flatus events over 8 hours, compared with more than 14 flatus events in those taking placebo (12395). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking activated charcoal 520 mg at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime for 7 days does not significantly reduce excessive gas or total flatus events when compared with baseline (12396).\nless\nHangover. There is no reliable evidence that activated charcoal prevents or treats hangover.\nActivated charcoal is included in some hangover remedies. However, ethanol adsorbs poorly to activated charcoal (12400).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral activated charcoal is beneficial in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nSome preliminary clinical research in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking activated charcoal 4-32 grams daily for 3 weeks decreases total cholesterol by up to 29% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by up to 41% when compared with control. The effects of activated charcoal appear to be dose-dependent. Additional clinical research shows that taking activated charcoal 20 grams twice daily for 3 weeks is as effective as cholestyramine 8 grams twice daily for treating hypercholesterolemia (12398), but the combined use of activated charcoal and cholestyramine does not appear to confer additional benefit when compared with either agent alone (12397). However, other research suggests that activated charcoal is not effective for treating hypercholesterolemia (12399). Reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may relate to the small size of the latter study, and the inclusion of some patients without hyperlipidemia.\nless\nHyperphosphatemia. Oral activated charcoal might reduce the incidence of hyperphosphatemia in patients with kidney disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small number of patients with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) shows that taking activated charcoal 0.6-1.2 grams three times daily for 12 months reduces the risk of hyperphosphatemia by 64% when compared with placebo. Additionally, in CKD patients who develop hyperphosphatemia, use of activated charcoal at the same dose for up to 24 months seems to delay the development of vascular calcification when compared with calcium carbonate, but not when compared with lanthanum carbonate (103193). Other preliminary clinical research in patients on hemodialysis shows that taking activated charcoal for 24 weeks, at a starting dose of 600 mg three times daily, increasing by 300 mg three times daily every 4 weeks until the goal phosphate level is reached, reduces phosphate levels to the goal in over 90% of patients when compared with baseline (93611). The lack of a control group limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nTooth whitening. It is unclear if toothpaste containing activated charcoal is beneficial for tooth whitening.\nA small clinical study in adults with dental stains due to factors such as coffee or tobacco use shows that using a toothpaste containing activated charcoal (Blanx Black, Coswell SpA) twice daily for 3 months reduces visible staining, dental plaque, and bleeding when compared to baseline, but not when compared with a micro-cleaning crystal toothpaste (Sensation White, Colgate) (111718).\nless\nWound healing. Research on the use of activated charcoal-containing dressings for wound healing is limited and conflicting.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that treating chronic venous leg ulcers with activated charcoal-containing dressings (Actisorb, Systagenix) for 6 weeks reduces ulcer size by 17% when compared with control occlusive or semi-occlusive dressings containing antibacterial or antiseptic agents (94731). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that treating pressure ulcers or venous leg ulcers with activated charcoal-containing dressings (Actisorb and Actisorb Silver 220, Systagenix) for 4 weeks does not significantly improve wound healing when compared with a hydrocolloid dressing (93603).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate activated charcoal for these uses.",

Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that activated charcoal decreases bile acid levels in pregnant patients with cholestasis (126).\nAnti-diarrhea effects\nIrinotecan-induced diarrhea is thought to be caused by the active metabolite SN38. This metabolite directly damages the intestinal mucosa. Activated charcoal may prevent irinotecan-induced diarrhea by adsorbing the SN38 metabolite (93608).\nAnti-flatulence effects\nAs activated charcoal is able to adsorb many drugs, it has also been shown to adsorb gases, suggesting that it might have a role in reducing flatulence after gas-producing meals (12395).\nDrug adsorption effects\nActivated charcoal adsorbs many drugs, increasing clearance and decreasing elimination half-life. It binds unabsorbed drugs in the gastrointestinal tract. It also binds drugs that diffuse or are transported from the circulation back into the intestine, and interrupts enterohepatic circulation of drugs. By this latter mechanism it can reduce exposure to drugs administered intravenously, including amiodarone, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, doxycycline, lorazepam, methotrexate, metronidazole, morphine, mycophenolate, phenytoin, valproate, and others (12392, 103192, 105543, 105816, 105817, 105818).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is growing interest in the use of activated charcoal as a treatment for acute gluten ingestion in patients with celiac disease. Mechanistically, this treatment may not be effective because the molecular weight of gluten proteins exceeds the maximum weight adsorbed by activated charcoal. However, in a survey of approximately 1600 individuals with celiac disease, 26% (424 patients) had heard of using activated charcoal for acute gluten exposure and 47% of these patients had tried this intervention (108854).\nLipid effects\nActivated charcoal is believed to decrease serum cholesterol levels by interfering with the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Cholesterol is needed to produce bile acids, and is used in larger amounts as bile acid synthesis is increased to normalize levels (12397).\nWound healing properties\nBased on in vitro and animal research, activated charcoal-containing dressings are believed to promote wound healing by adsorbing bacteria, local toxins, and wound degradation products (93603, 93614)."

While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, L. acidophilus is not specifically recommended for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",

L. acidophilus has been combined with Bifidobacterium animalis (HOWARU Protect, Danisco) for up to 6 months in children 3-5 years old (16847), with Bifidobacterium bifidum for 6 weeks (90602, 96890), with Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (Complete Probiotic Platinum) for 18 months in children 4 months to 5 years of age (103436), and in a specific product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) containing a total of 8 species for 3 months in children 2-12 years old (107497). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of L. acidophilus in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. A combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium bifidum has been used with apparent safety for 6 weeks, starting at 24-28 weeks' gestation (95416, 98430).\nLACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Lactobacillus acidophilus during lactation. However, there are currently no reasons to expect safety concerns when used appropriately.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and intravaginally, Lactobacillus acidophilus is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Mild gastrointestinal adverse effects.\n\nIntravaginally: Vaginal discharge.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There is concern that L. acidophilus may cause infections in some people.\nDermatologic\nOrally, in one clinical trial, a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei F19, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lacltis BB-12 was associated with two cases of rash, one with itching. However, it is not clear if these adverse effects were due to L. acidophilus, other ingredients, the combination, or if the events were idiosyncratic (90236).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, taking Lactobacillus acidophilus in combination with other probiotics may cause gastrointestinal side effects including epigastric discomfort (90239), abdominal pain (90239, 90291, 111785), dyspepsia (90239), flatulence (107497, 107520), bloating (107497, 111785), diarrhea (111785), vomiting (107537), and burping (90239); however, these events are uncommon.\nless\nGenitourinary\nIntravaginally, cream containing Lactobacillus acidophilus has been shown to cause increased vaginal discharge in about 5% of patients, compared to about 1% of patients receiving placebo cream (90237). Vaginal burning was reported by one person using intravaginal L. acidophilus and Limosilactobacillus fermentum in a clinical trial (111781).\nless\nImmunologic\nSince Lactobacillus acidophilus preparations contain live and active microorganisms, there is some concern that they might cause pathogenic infection in some patients. L. acidophilus has been isolated in some cases of bacteremia, sepsis, splenic abscess, liver abscess, endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, pancreatic necrosis, and meningoencephalitis. Most of these cases are thought to be due to the translocation of bacteria from other locations in the body in which they occur naturally, such as the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract (107543, 111782, 111792). L. acidophilus endophthalmitis has been reported rarely (111787, 111795). In one case, it was related to intravitreal injections for age-related macular degeneration in a 90-year-old female with an intraocular lens (111787). In another, it occurred following cataract surgery (111795).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Most research shows that oral Lactobacillus acidophilus, alone or in combination with other probiotics, seems to reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in adults.\nA meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials in hospitalized or outpatient adults shows that taking L. acidophilus alone or in combination with up to 8 other probiotic strains reduces the risk of AAD by 34% when compared with taking placebo (107635). One small clinical trial in elderly adults shows that AAD occurred in 17% of those taking L. acidophilus (Florajen Acidophilus) 20 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) three times daily, compared with 37% of those taking placebo (95400). A number of combination products have also demonstrated benefit for preventing AAD, including Bio-K+ Cl1285 which provides L. acidophilus CL1285, Lacticaseibacillus casei LBC80R, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus CLR2 as 100 billion CFUs daily (25494, 95402, 95403); L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (90239); and Ecologic AAD which provides L. acidophilus NIZO 3678 and NIZO 3887, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei NIZO 3672, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NIZO 3684, L. rhamnosus NIZO 3689, Ligilactobacillus salivarius NIZO 3675, Bifidobacterium bifidum NIZO 3804, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NIZO 3680, and Enterococcus faecium NIZO 3886 (95405). However, some combination products have not demonstrated benefit. Clinical research shows that taking a combination of L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria or a combination of L. acidophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lactinex) is not beneficial (90231, 90239, 92255, 95385). An additional large clinical trial in children aged 3 months and up shows that taking L. acidophilus in combination with other probiotics does not reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea when compared with taking placebo, when the more stringent definition is considered excluding diarrhea of other etiologies. However, the risk of diarrhea of any etiology is reduced by 35%. The probiotic supplement provided a total of 10 billion CFUs of L. acidophilus W37, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis W51, Lactobacillus acidophilus W55, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum W62, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus W71, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24 daily from the first day of antibiotic treatment until 7 days after treatment ended (110969).\nless\nBacterial vaginosis. Most clinical research shows that intravaginal application of Lactobacillus acidophilus may be helpful for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is unclear if oral L. acidophilus is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of bacterial vaginosis.\nOne clinical trial shows that intravaginal suppositories containing 100 million to 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of L. acidophilus (Vivag, Pharma Vinci A/S) given twice daily for 6 days improve bacterial vaginosis resolution rates when compared with placebo (13177). Another clinical trial shows that using 1-2 vaginal tablets containing viable L. acidophilus 10 million CFUs and estriol 0.03 mg per tablet (Gynoflor, Medinova) daily for 6 days increases cure rates when compared with placebo (13176). However, using this product in combination with metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 7 days does not improve outcomes when compared with metronidazole alone (90237). Preliminary clinical research in patients with clinically defined bacterial vaginosis shows that daily intravaginal application with a douche providing L. acidophilus 1 billion CFUs per mL for 6 days might have beneficial effects on the vaginal flora. When compared with 52.5% of patients with bacterial vaginosis based on bacterial flora at baseline, 7.5% met this criteria 14 days after treatment had been completed (111788).\n\nOral L. acidophilus has also been evaluated. Preliminary clinical research shows that eating yogurt 125 mL daily enriched with L. acidophilus for 2 months might slightly decrease the incidence of recurrent bacterial vaginosis (1245). L. acidophilus has also been investigated in an oral formulation in combination with other probiotics. Clinical research in patients with bacterial vaginosis cured within the past 48 hours shows that taking a product containing L. acidophilus in combination with other probiotics results in recurrence of vaginosis in 18.3% of patients, a statistically significant reduction compared with 32.1% of those using placebo. The mean time to recurrence was approximately 23 days longer in patients taking the lactobacilli. The product contained L. acidophilus 1.08 billion CFUs along with Lactobacillus crispatus LMG S-29995 and Levilactobacillus brevis (Lactogyn, Vésale Pharma, Belgium), and was taken twice daily for 7 days and then once daily for up to an additional 120 days (110950).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus, usually in combination with other probiotics, seems to improve H. pylori eradication when used along with standard therapies. It is unclear if heat-killed L. acidophilus is beneficial for H. pylori eradication.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies utilizing probiotic products containing L. acidophilus shows that these products can improve H. pylori eradication rates 1.14- to 1.24-fold when taken in combination with triple therapy consisting of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Based on these results, about 7-11 patients would need to be treated in order for one additional patient to achieve complete remission (95394). Only one of the trials in this analysis investigated L. acidophilus alone; an additional 8 used L. acidophilus in combination with other probiotics. Individual clinical trials have shown that a combination of L. acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis 30 million colony-forming units (CFUs) total, taken in three divided doses daily, from 2 weeks prior tol 2 weeks after triple therapy increases H. pylori eradication when compared with triple therapy alone (90248). In children, a combination of L. acidophilus (strain 5) 94 million CFUs and Bifidobacterium bifidum (strain 12) 8.6 million CFUs in combination with a PPI, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole has been used daily for 2 weeks, followed by the probiotics alone for an additional 4 weeks (90602). However, other individual clinical trials have shown that L. acidophilus in combination with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Streptococcus faecium may not improve eradication rates when taken with triple therapy consisting of furazolidone, tetracycline, and lansoprazole (90279). Also, taking L. acidophilus along with six other probiotics in conjunction with bismuth quadruple therapy does not seem to improve H. pylori eradication rates when compared with placebo and bismuth quadruple therapy (90291). Also, taking L. acidophilus and L. casei without any standard H. pylori therapy does not improve H. pylori eradication rates in adults (12766).\n\nHeat-killed L. acidophilus has also been investigated in adults with H. pylori. Taking a lyophilized and inactivated culture of L. acidophilus (Lacteol Fort) containing 5 billion cells, 3 times daily for 10 days, modestly increases the eradication rate in patients using triple therapy of rabeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin for 7 days (8562).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some research shows that oral live Lactobacillus acidophilus, taken alone or in combination with other probiotics, may be beneficial for IBS. The effects of non-viable, heat-killed L. acidophilus are unclear.\nClinical research in adults with IBS shows that taking L. acidophilus DDS-1 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 6 weeks modestly reduces the severity of abdominal pain when compared with placebo. Also, 52% of patients experienced a more than 30% reduction in pain severity, compared with 16% of those taking placebo. There were also improvements in abdominal distention and duration of pain; however, there were no changes in bowel habits (107581). A meta-analysis shows that taking L. acidophilus improves the rate of symptom relief and reduces bloating severity when compared with placebo. However, other symptoms were not improved (110866).\n\nL. acidophilus has also been examined in combination with other probiotics. One clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) containing L. acidophilus and 7 other species as 450 billion CFUs daily in two divided doses for 8 weeks improves abdominal bloating, but not abdominal pain, flatulence, or number of stools, in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) (11379). Another clinical study in patients with IBS-D shows that taking a specific multi-species probiotic (NordBiotic, MBM Biotix) containing L. acidophilus LA120, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR110, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LPC100, Lacticaseibacillus casei LC130, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LP140, Bifidobacterium breve BB010, Bifidobacterium longum BL020, Bifidobacterium bifidum BF030, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BL040, and Streptococcus thermophilus ST250 as 2.5 billion CFUs total twice daily for 8 weeks improves overall symptom severity, as well as pain severity, pain frequency, and quality of life, when compared with placebo. Symptom severity was rated as mild by approximately 60% of those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 30% of those taking placebo (107516). A small clinical trial shows that taking L. acidophilus NCFM plus Lactobacillus helveticus Lafti L10 (Lallemand Health Solutions) 5 billion CFUs each daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces flatus and overall symptoms, but not abdominal pain or bloating, when compared with taking placebo (111785).\n\nHowever, other probiotic compounds containing L. acidophilus have not demonstrated benefit in most patients with IBS. These include L. acidophilus NCFM 10 billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks; L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (Cultura) 13-20 billion CFUs daily for 6 months; or L. acidophilus CL1285, L. casei LBC80R, and L. rhamnosus CLR2 50 billion CFUs each daily for 3 months (90236, 94696, 94697, 95365, 99789). Further research is needed to determine which IBS subtype, if any, is most likely to benefit.\n\nHeat-killed L. acidophilus has also been investigated in patients with IBS. One clinical study shows that taking capsules containing heat-killed L. acidophilus (Lacteol Fort) 20 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 6 weeks improves abdominal pain, bloating, and number and quality of stools when compared with placebo (7744). Also, in patients with IBS-D, observational research has found that use of heat-killed L. acidophilus (Lacteol LB) two capsules daily for one month modestly reduces pain and bloating and improves quality of life. The average weekly number of stools decreased by approximately 4.75. Also, the number of patients with watery stools was reduced from 54% at baseline to 19% (107535).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAtopic disease. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus does not seem to be beneficial for preventing atopic disease in children.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that administering L. acidophilus during pregnancy, when breastfeeding, or to newborn infants might actually increase the risk of atopic sensitization (90251). However, the number of studies included in this analysis was limited.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA preliminary clinical study shows that taking a specific probiotic product containing L. acidophilus 5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 5 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium bifidum 20 billion CFUs (Trenev Trio/Healthy Trinity, Natren) twice daily along with minocycline once every evening for 12 weeks improves inflamed and non-inflamed acne lesions in 82% of patients, compared to only 67% of patients treated with either the probiotic combination or minocycline alone (90270).\nless\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in premature infants shows that taking 6 billion CFUs of a combination of L. acidophilus NCDO 1748 and Bifidobacterium bifidum NCDO 2203 (UFC Inforan, Switzerland) from 7 days of age until 34 weeks postmenstrual age or discharge does not reduce the odds of ARDS when compared with a control group of infants not given these probiotics. The infants in this study were born at less than 32 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111794). This study is limited by the lack of randomization to treatment group; placement was based on year of birth.\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus acidophilus is beneficial for allergic rhinitis prevention or treatment.\nA small clinical trial in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis shows that taking heat-treated milk fermented with L. acidophilus L-92 100 mL daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces nasal symptoms and mucus, but not ocular symptoms, when compared with taking an acidified placebo milk. The milk provided approximately 30 billion L. acidophilus cells (25488). The effect of L. acidophilus as a probiotic is unclear from this study. Other clinical research shows that drinking 250 mL of fermented milk containing L. acidophilus La-5 5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG 50 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 50 billion CFUs from 36 weeks' gestation until 3 months postpartum does not reduce the incidence of allergic rhinitis in the child at 6 years of age when compared with placebo milk (96893).\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus acidophilus can improve lung function in people with asthma.\nA small clinical crossover study in patients with moderate asthma shows that consuming live active yogurt 225 grams, providing L. acidophilus 760 million colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram, twice daily for 1 month does not affect measures of lung function when compared with yogurt not containing L. acidophilus. All yogurt contained Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (1244).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that intake of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria-based probiotics during gestation, followed by giving the probiotic to the newborn for the first 2-6 months of life, reduces the risk of developing atopic dermatitis by 40% over the next 6-24 months when compared with placebo, regardless of family history of atopy. However, only four of 10 studies included in the analysis used L. acidophilus as part of the probiotic combination; the results from these individual, small studies support the overall findings of the meta-analysis (107503). Some clinical research also shows that supplementation with 250 mL of fermented milk containing L. acidophilus La-5, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 starting at 36 weeks' gestation and continuing until 3 months' postpartum, without supplementation in the infant, reduces the overall occurrence of atopic dermatitis in the child at 2 years of age. However, at 6 years of age, the effect appears to be inconclusive (96893). In children ages 1-3 years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, taking 5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of a combination of L. acidophilus DDS-1 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis UABLA-12 along with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) (DDS Junior) twice daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces symptom severity and the need for topical corticosteroids when compared with placebo (110995).\nless\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne large observational study in premature infants suggests that taking L. acidophilus 1 to 3 billion CFUs with Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis during the first month of life for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis was not associated with a reduced risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The infants in this study were born between 22-29 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111771).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Lactobacillus acidophilus for cancer prevention or treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. acidophilus for this condition.\nCanker sores. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of mainly small and preliminary clinical trials shows that taking lactobacilli probiotics has a small effect on pain from canker sores. However, the dose and duration of probiotic and the specific species, as well as endpoints and results from individual studies, are mixed. One small study shows that taking a combination of L. acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis reduces pain, but not the number of lesions or healing time, when compared with placebo. Another study shows that using lozenges providing inulin 0.13 gram along with L. acidophilus and B. animalis subsp. lactis 1.5 billion colony-forming units each reduces pain, but does not affect ulcer size or healing, when compared with Oracure gel (105146). Many of the individual studies may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nCholestasis. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in premature infants shows that the risk of developing cholestasis is reduced from 22% to 6% in those given a blend of L. acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and Enterococcus faecalis (Peifeikang powder, Shanghai Xinyi Pharmaceutical Company) at least 5 million colony-forming units three times daily, from birth until implementation of total parenteral nutrition, when compared with infants not given this powder. In the infants that developed cholestasis, the severity was reduced, resulting in a reduction in the rate of cholestatic liver injury, feeding intolerance, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The number of days to reach full enteral feeding, days to normal weight gain, and days of hospitalization were reduced by approximately 2.8, 2.1, and 1.7 days, respectively (103448).\nless\nColic. Oral inactivated Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study in infants with colic shows that giving a specific multi-ingredient product (Colimil Plus, Milte Italia SPA) containing inactivated L. acidophilus 1 billion colony-forming units, lemon balm 65 mg, and German chamomile 9 mg twice daily for 4 weeks reduces crying time similarly to Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 100 million CFUs daily (96278). It is unclear how L. acidophilus compares with no treatment.\nless\nCommon cold. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in school children shows that taking a combination of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum (Infloran, Berna) 1 billion colony-forming units each twice daily for 3 months reduces the absolute percentage of school absence due to cold symptoms by 30% when compared with placebo (90286).\nless\nConstipation. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that stool frequency is increased and symptoms of functional constipation in adults are improved with the use of a specific combination product (Hexbio) providing L. acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis 30 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for 7 days (90266). However, most other probiotic compounds containing L. acidophilus have not demonstrated benefit in most patients with constipation. One small clinical trial shows that taking yogurt 180 mL providing L. acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis HN019, and polydextrose (Litesse) daily for 2 weeks modestly improves clinical response and reduces transit time when compared with taking a control yogurt. However, there was no effect on the number of daily bowel movements (90275). Other studies show that taking Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 6.6 billion CFUs daily for 4 weeks in combination with Bifidobacterium longum UABl-14, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis UABla-12, Bifidobacterium bifidum UABb-10, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) 7 mg does not improve symptoms of constipation when compared with a placebo providing FOS (110970). Also, there was a general lack of support for symptom improvement following the intake of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM 10 billion CFUs daily with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Lpc-37 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strains Bl-04, Bi-07, and HN019 daily for 2 weeks (110979).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in critically ill, hospitalized adults shows that taking L. acidophilus LA-5 1.75 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 500 million CFUs, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB12 1.75 billion CFUs, and Saccharomyces boulardii 1.5 billion CFUs twice daily for 15 days modestly reduces the risk of sepsis, as well as the length of stay in the ICU and hospital, when compared with placebo (107524).\nless\nDenture stomatitis. Although there has been interest in using oral Lactobacillus acidophilus for denture stomatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. acidophilus for this condition.\nDepression. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with major depression shows that taking L. acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium bifidum daily for 8 weeks reduces symptoms of depression measured on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) when compared with placebo (99780). However, the validity of the results from this study is limited by incomplete reporting. For example, patient baseline BDI scores were not reported.\nless\nDiabetes. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus in combination with other probiotic species seems to be beneficial for the treatment of gestational diabetes, although it is unclear if it is beneficial for treatment of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Oral L. acidophilus is unlikely to be beneficial for the prevention of gestational diabetes.\nAlthough some individual studies disagree, meta-analyses of clinical research in patients with gestational diabetes show that taking probiotics, most often L. acidophilus in combination with other species, improves glycemic indices such as fasting blood glucose and insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo (102288, 104156). Also, one meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking probiotics specifically containing L. acidophilus in combination with other species modestly improves these glycemic indices, as well as levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides, but not low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (111796). Some doses used in available studies include a combination of freeze-dried L. acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium bifidum each as 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram daily for 6 weeks (95416, 98430), a total of 4 billion CFUs of a combination of L. acidophilus LA-5, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12, Streptococcus thermophilus STY-31, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LBY-27 for 8 weeks starting at 24-28 weeks' gestation (96892), and a specific product containing L. acidophilus and 7 other probiotics (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) as a total of 112.5 billion CFUs twice daily for 8 weeks (107549). Meta-analyses in patients with gestational diabetes show that taking probiotics such as L. acidophilus does not reduce the risk for caesarean section birth, neonatal hypoglycemia, large for gestational age birth, or hypertensive disorders such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, or eclampsia (102288, 104156, 111796). However, one meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking probiotics specifically containing L. acidophilus modestly reduces neonatal birth weight, but not maternal weight gain (111796).\n\nTaking L. acidophilus does not seem to be effective for PREVENTING gestational diabetes. A large clinical trial shows that taking L. acidophilus LA1 7.5 billion CFUs, Bifidobacterium longum sp54 cs 1.5 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium bifidum sp9 cs 6 billion CFUs daily from 14-24 weeks' gestation does not reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes when compared with taking placebo (107520).\n\nResearch on the use of L. acidophilus for type 2 diabetes is mixed. Taking a combination of L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 12 weeks does not reduce levels of fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo (107521). One clinical study shows that taking L. acidophilus along with six other probiotic strains (Familact) daily for 6 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose, but does not affect plasma insulin, when compared with placebo (99790). A small clinical trial shows that taking fermented goat milk 120 grams containing one billion CFUs each of L. acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 daily for 6 weeks modestly reduces levels of HbA1c and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but not fasting blood glucose or insulin resistance, when compared with conventional fermented milk containing Streptococcus thermophilus TA-40 (110973). However, other clinical research shows that taking L. acidophilus 1 billion CFUs, along with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Bacillus coagulans GanedenBC30 (GBI-30, 6086), and fructo-oligosaccharides 500 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and insulin and improves measures of insulin resistance when compared with placebo (107731). Another clinical trial shows that taking yogurt 200 grams daily containing L. acidophilus 4.65 million CFUs per gram along with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis modestly reduces levels of HbA1c, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol, but not fasting glucose, when compared with a placebo yogurt (111798).\n\nA combination probiotic containing L. acidophilus has also been evaluated in children 2-12 years of age with new-onset type 1 diabetes. One clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) providing 112.5 billion CFUs daily for 3 months modestly decreases HbA1c and insulin requirements when compared with placebo. Also, about three times as many children achieved remission, defined as insulin requirements of less than 0.5 U/kg daily and HbA1c less than 7%. However, C-peptide levels and the maintenance of residual pancreatic beta-cell function were not affected when compared with placebo (107497).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with diabetic nephropathy not taking antidiabetes drugs shows that taking a combination of L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces the ratio of microalbuminuria/creatinine (mAlb/Cr), a marker of kidney damage, when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (107521).\nless\nDiarrhea. Oral heat-killed L. acidophilus seems to reduce the duration of diarrhea in adults and children. Oral live L. acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children with dysentery being treated with ceftriaxone shows that taking a specific combination probiotic sachet (Kidilact, Zisttakhmir Company) containing live L. acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium breve, and Streptococcus thermophilus daily for 5 days modestly reduces the duration of diarrhea, hospitalization, and blood in diarrhea when compared with control (102417).\n\nHeat-killed L. acidophilus has also been investigated for the treatment of diarrhea. A meta-analysis of four small clinical studies in infants and children ages 1 month to 4 years shows that taking heat-killed L. acidophilus LB 20-30 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for up to 5 days along with oral or intravenous rehydration therapy can modestly reduce the duration of diarrhea, primarily of non-rotaviral origin (90295). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with functional chronic diarrhea shows that taking heat-killed L. acidophilus LB (Lacteol Fort, Laboratoire du Lacteol du Dr Boucard) as two capsules twice daily for a total of 20 billion cells daily for 4 weeks reduces daily stool frequency by 3.5, compared with a reduction of 1.2 in patients taking five chewable capsules three times daily of an unspecified strain of L. acidophilus (Lacidophilin, Tai Ge Pharma Ltd). Stool consistency, pain, distention, and total efficacy, defined as a decrease in mean symptoms by at least 40%, were also further improved in patients taking the heat-killed product (107537). However, other clinical research in children ages 6 months to 12 years hospitalized with acute diarrhea shows that taking 15 billion heat-killed L. acidophilus (Lactrol, Raptakos) cells daily for 3 days along with oral rehydration solution (ORS) does not have beneficial effects on duration of diarrhea, frequency of stools, or length of hospital stay, when compared with ORS alone (111789).\n\nThe European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388) However, L. acidophilus is not a specific focus of the guidelines and most evidence is low quality.\nless\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients newly diagnosed with GAD shows that taking sertraline 25 mg plus probiotics daily for 8 weeks may modestly reduce some symptoms of anxiety when compared with sertraline alone. However, the reduction in anxiety score was small and change was not consistent between rating scales. Also, the quality of life was not improved. The probiotics provided a total of 18 billion colony-forming units of L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (110977).\nless\nHepatic encephalopathy. Although there has been interest in using oral Lactobacillus acidophilus for hepatic encephalopathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. acidophilus for this condition.\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral Lactobacillus acidophilus for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. acidophilus for this condition.\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus acidophilus is beneficial for lowering cholesterol levels; the available research is conflicting.\nTwo meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking fermented milk products containing L. acidophilus can reduce total cholesterol by about 14-19 mg/dL in adults with or without hypercholesterolemia. However, the effect of L. acidophilus on both total and LDL cholesterol levels is conflicting from available research (95396, 95397, 95399). Clinical trials included in these meta-analyses evaluated patients with hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), metabolic syndrome, and others. Taking L. acidophilus does not appear to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels (95396, 95397, 95399). Doses used in some studies have included fermented milk products providing L. acidophilus 39 million to 2 billion CFUs daily, alone or along with other probiotic species, for up to 6 weeks (95396). One small clinical trial in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking L. acidophilus LA-1 60 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) three times daily for 6 weeks does not affect serum lipids when compared with taking placebo (111791). A meta-analysis of nine small to moderate-sized clinical studies shows that taking a combination of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis reduces levels of total cholesterol when compared with placebo (107591). However, it is unclear if this is due to L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, or their combination.\nless\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral Lactobacillus acidophilus for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. acidophilus for this condition.\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical trial in patients with collagenous colitis shows that taking 10 billion colony-forming units each of L. acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. lactis BB-12 twice daily for 12 weeks does not increase the proportion of patients with a reduction in weekly bowel frequency of at least 50% when compared with placebo. Also, there was no effect of this combination on stool consistency or abdominal symptoms. However, there were some modest benefits when compared with baseline (110999). This study was small and may have been underpowered to detect differences.\nless\nIntraventricular hemorrhage. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in premature infants shows that taking 6 billion CFUs of a combination of L. acidophilus NCDO 1748 and Bifidobacterium bifidum NCDO 2203 (UFC Inforan, Switzerland) from 7 days of age until 34 weeks postmenstrual age or discharge does not reduce the odds of intraventricular hemorrhage when compared with a control group of infants not given these probiotics. The infants in this study were born at less than 32 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111794). This study is limited by the lack of randomization to treatment group; placement was based on year of birth.\nless\nLactose intolerance. It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus acidophilus is beneficial for lactose intolerance.\nOne small clinical trial shows that consuming 400 mL of a non-fermented milk product containing L. acidophilus 530 million colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL daily does not reduce symptoms of lactose intolerance or hydrogen breath test results when compared with milk without L. acidophilus (16737). Another small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking L. acidophilus BG2FO4 10 billion CFUs twice daily for 7 days does not reduce lactose-induced gastrointestinal symptoms or improve lactose digestion based on breath hydrogen when compared with baseline (111783). However, another clinical trial shows that adding various L. acidophilus strains 800 million to 1 billion CFUs/mL to non-fermented milk improves hydrogen breath tests in patients with lactose intolerance (16738).\nless\nLyme disease. Although there has been interest in using oral Lactobacillus acidophilus for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. acidophilus for this condition.\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in elderly patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a combination of L. acidophilus PBS066-DSM 24,936, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PBS067-DSM 24,937, and Limosilactobacillus reuteri PBS072-DSM 25,175 as 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each, with inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides daily for 60 days, reduces the number of patients diagnosed with metabolic syndrome by 23%, compared with a 10% reduction in those taking placebo. In the probiotic group, there were modest improvements in waist circumference and levels of fasting plasma insulin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and inflammatory mediators when compared with placebo. However, there were no significant differences between groups for fasting blood glucose or blood pressure. All patients in this study were on a Mediterranean-like standard diet (107560).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus acidophilus is beneficial or safe for NEC prevention.\nMost meta-analyses of clinical research show that giving lactobacilli enterally reduces the risk of NEC and/or severe NEC in preterm, mainly very low birth weight (VLBW), infants. Some meta-analyses support the use of lactobacilli in combination with bifidobacteria, as opposed to lactobacilli alone for reducing the risk of NEC. However, only a small number of the individual studies included in these analyses have investigated the effects of L. acidophilus, which was used as part of a combination probiotic and/or prebiotic product in all cases (95344, 95351, 103437, 103445, 104157, 105162, 105164). Also, guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies with respect to the use of probiotics in very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in this group of infants (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608). The Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that probiotic combinations may be of benefit in reducing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates over 1000 grams. However, L. acidophilus is not specifically recommended (103003, 111609, 111611).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn children with NAFLD, clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (Prokid, Gostaresh Milad Pouya Company) containing L. acidophilus ATCC B3208 3 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus DSMZ 21690 2 billion CFUs, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DSMZ 32269 6 billion CFUs, and Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC SD6576 2 billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks normalizes liver sonography findings in 53% of children, compared with 17% of those taking placebo. In addition, levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are reduced by 30% and 25%, respectively. There was no effect on body mass index or blood lipids when compared with placebo (105156). Another clinical trial shows that taking two sachets daily for 3 months of a specific combination product (VSL#3) containing L. acidophilus and other probiotics modestly decreases triglyceride levels and liver enzymes when compared with taking placebo. However, there was no change in body mass index or most glycemic or lipid parameters (111009). However, taking L. acidophilus in combination with other probiotics does not seem to be beneficial in adults with NAFLD. Clinical research shows that taking yogurt 100 grams, containing L. acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 40 million CFUs and vitamin D 1000 IU, daily for 3 months does not improve fasting blood glucose levels, insulin levels, blood pressure, or anthropometric indices when compared with unfortified yogurt (105174). Also, a small clinical trial shows that taking a combination of L. acidophilus BCMC 12,130, Lacticaseibacillus casei BCMC 12,313, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BCMC 12,451, Bifidobacterium bifidum BCMC 02290, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis BCMC 02129, and Bifidobacterium longum BCMC 02120 30 billion colony-forming units twice daily for 6 months has no beneficial effects on hepatic steatosis or fibrosis or on levels of liver enzymes, blood lipids, or fasting glucose, when compared with placebo (107523).\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with NASH shows that taking 1 billion colony-forming units each of L. acidophilus ATCC SD5221 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis HN019 daily for 6 months does not have beneficial effects on severity of liver fibrosis or steatosis, metabolic markers, or inflammation when compared with taking placebo. The effect of this combination on liver enzymes was mixed (111797).\nless\nObesity. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn combination with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BS01, taking L. acidophilus LA02 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 6 weeks does not reduce body weight or body fat when compared with placebo in young, healthy females, only some of whom were overweight (103438). However, another clinical study shows that taking 50 billion CFUs of a specific combination of L. acidophilus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and B. animalis subsp. lactis (Lab4P) for 24 weeks reduces body weight by an additional 1.3 kg more than placebo (103439).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with PCOS, clinical research shows that taking a combination of L. acidophilus T16 (IBRC-M10785), Lacticaseibacillus casei T2 (IBRC-M10783), and Bifidobacterium bifidum T1 (IBRC-M10771) 2 billion colony-forming units each, plus inulin 800 mg, daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces serum insulin and triglyceride levels and improves insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo. However, it does not alter cholesterol or fasting glucose levels (105159). Another clinical trial shows that 31.3% of patients with PCOS taking L. acidophilus in combination with other probiotics daily for 6 months had regular menstrual cycles compared with 12.5% of those taking placebo. There were also modest improvements in testosterone levels and waist circumference, but not other hormones, insulin resistance, body weight, or most measures of quality of life. The product provided Lactobacillus acidophilus UBLA-34 2 billion CFUs along with Bifidobacterium bifidum UBBB-55, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UBLP-40, Lacticaseibacillus casei UBLC-42, Limosilactobacillus fermentum UBLF-31, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus UBLR-58, Limosilactobacillus reuteri UBLRu-87, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) daily for 2 months and then twice daily for 4 months. All patients also underwent dietary and lifestyle changes (110974).\nless\nPostoperative infection. Although there has been interest in using oral Lactobacillus acidophilus for preventing postoperative infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lactobacillus for this purpose.\nPouchitis. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nContinuous oral treatment for one year with a specific concentrated formulation of L. acidophilus and other probiotics (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) as 6 grams (300-500 billion live bacteria per gram), daily for up 12 months seems to maintain remission of pouchitis in 85% of patients (6087, 12769). Also, one small clinical study shows that taking a specific product (Trilac, Allergon AB) containing L. acidophilus 600 million colony-forming units (CFUs) per capsule, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 400 million CFUs per capsule, and Bifidobacterium bifidum 600 million CFUs per capsule, taken in doses of two capsules three times daily for 9 months, can reduce pouchitis severity and the number of patients experiencing pouchitis when compared to baseline (90296). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking probiotics during pregnancy reduces the severity and duration of nausea and vomiting by 16% to 54%. There was also a small benefit on stool hardness. A specific probiotic (Probiotics 10, Nature's Bounty) was taken as 2 capsules daily for two back-to-back cycles of six days with probiotics and two days without. Each capsule contained a total of 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of L. acidophilus La-14, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v and DSM 15312, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus Lb-87, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DSM 13434 and Lpc-37, Ligilactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-35, Lacticaseibacillus casei Lc-11, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04, along with inulin 200 mg (107199).\nless\nPrematurity. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn premature infants, clinical research shows that taking a blend of L. acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and Enterococcus faecalis (Peifeikang powder, Shanghai Xinyi Pharmaceutical Company), at least 5 million colony-forming units (CFUs) three times daily from birth until implementation of total parenteral nutrition, reduces the rate of development of extrauterine growth retardation from 15% to 8% when compared with those not receiving this blend (103448). Other preliminary clinical research in premature infants shows that taking 6 billion CFUs of a combination of L. acidophilus NCDO 1748 and Bifidobacterium bifidum NCDO 2203 (UFC Inforan, Switzerland) from 7 days of age until 34 weeks postmenstrual age or discharge reduces the odds of neurodevelopment impairment at 24 months corrected age by 70% when compared with a control group of infants not given these probiotics. The odds of having moderate to severe impairment were also reduced. The infants in this study were born at less than 32 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111794). This study is limited by the lack of randomization to treatment group; placement was based on year of birth. Observational research has also been conducted. One large observational study in infants fed strictly human milk, but not strictly formula or a combination, suggests that taking L. acidophilus 1 to 3 billion CFUs with Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis during the first month of life for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis was associated with a modest increased weight gain velocity. The infants in this study were born between 22-29 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111771).\nless\nPsoriasis. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with psoriasis shows that taking a mixture of probiotics for 8 weeks modestly improves overall symptoms and feelings of depression when compared with placebo. The percentage of patients achieving at least a 50% or 75% reduction in overall symptom score was 40% and 24%, respectively, in those taking the probiotic mixture, compared with 16% and 8% of those taking placebo. Each probiotic capsule was used twice daily and provided a total daily dose of 2.6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and Bifidobacterium longum (107498).\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with cervical cancer receiving radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy shows that taking a specific product (Biogurt, Fame Pharmaceuticals) containing L. acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 as 1.75 billion lyophilized colony-forming units (CFUs) as a capsule three times daily throughout treatment reduces the risk of diarrhea by 28% when compared with placebo. The treatment group also used less loperamide (102285). Another small clinical trial in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy with weekly cisplatin shows that taking L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum (Infloran, Laboratio Farmaceutico SIT) as 1 billion CFUs each, twice daily from seven days before starting radiotherapy and continuing during radiotherapy, reduces the incidence of moderate to severe diarrhea and the need for antidiarrheal medication when compared with placebo. Moderate to severe diarrhea occurred in 9% of patients using the probiotics, compared with 45% of those taking placebo (107580).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in children ages 3-5 years who attend daycare centers shows that taking a combination milk product containing 5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis (HOWARU Protect, Danisco) reduces the risk of experiencing fever, cough, and rhinorrhea by 45% when compared with placebo. Patients taking this combination experienced an average 2-day shorter duration of symptoms and were significantly less likely to use an antibiotic for their symptoms. Patients who took L. acidophilus without bifidobacterium also had a reduction in fever, cough, and use of antibiotics, but not rhinorrhea (16847). In healthy children aged 3-10 years, clinical research shows that taking 12.5 billion CFUs daily of a specific combination of L. acidophilus CUL21 and CUL60, Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL34 (Lab4), and vitamin C 50 mg daily reduces the risk of cough by 16% and sore throat by 20%, and modestly reduces school absenteeism and antibiotic use when compared with placebo. However, nasal symptoms, fever, and wheezing were not reduced (106943). A different combination product containing L. acidophilus DDS-1 1 billion CFUs and B. animalis subsp. lactis UABLA-12 4 billion CFUs (Up4-Junior, UAS Laboratories) with fructo-oligosaccharides 50 mg has also been evaluated. Clinical research in children 3-12 years of age with a sick household member shows that taking this product daily for 2 weeks modestly shortens the duration of respiratory infections, but does not reduce the risk of developing an infection, when compared with placebo (98439). In overweight adults or adults with obesity, taking 50 billion CFUs of a specific combination of L. acidophilus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, B. bifidum, and B. animalis subsp. lactis (Lab4P) for 24 weeks reduces the overall likelihood of having upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, such as sneezing, cough, and blocked nose, by approximately 40% when compared with placebo (103439).\nless\nRetinopathy of prematurity. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in premature infants shows that taking 6 billion CFUs of a combination of L. acidophilus NCDO 1748 and Bifidobacterium bifidum NCDO 2203 (UFC Inforan, Switzerland) from 7 days of age until 34 weeks postmenstrual age or discharge does not reduce the odds of retinopathy of prematurity when compared with a control group of infants not given these probiotics. The infants in this study were born at less than 32 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111794). This study is limited by the lack of randomization to treatment group; placement was based on year of birth. Also, one large observational study in premature infants suggests that taking L. acidophilus 1 to 3 billion CFUs with Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis during the first month of life for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis was not associated with a reduced risk of retinopathy of prematurity. The infants in this study were born between 22-29 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111771).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in patients with moderate-to-severe RA shows that taking capsules containing freeze-dried strains of L. acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium bifidum daily for 8 weeks does not improve RA severity, the number of tender or swollen joints, or joint pain when compared with placebo (95418).\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus acidophilus is beneficial for rotaviral diarrhea.\nOne preliminary clinical study shows that taking a combination of L. acidophilus AD031 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) and Bifidobacterium longum BORI 20 billion CFUs twice daily for 3 days reduces the duration of rotaviral diarrhea by an average of 3 days when compared with placebo (95334). However, one clinical study using a lower dose and different strain of L. acidophilus (La-14) 200 million CFUs twice daily for 5 days shows that this regimen does not reduce the duration of watery diarrhea or affect the viral load in children aged 9 months to 5 years with confirmed norovirus or rotavirus infection (96887). A small clinical study shows that heat-killed L. acidophilus LB 20-30 billion cells daily for up to 4 days can modestly reduce the duration of diarrhea in infants and children, some of which had confirmed rotavirus (90295).\nless\nSepsis. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in premature infants shows that taking 6 billion CFUs of a combination of L. acidophilus NCDO 1748 with Bifidobacterium bifidum NCDO 2203 (UFC Inforan, Switzerland) from 7 days of age until 34 weeks postmenstrual age or discharge reduces the odds of late onset sepsis by 55% when compared with a control group of infants not given these probiotics. The infants in this study were born at less than 32 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111794). This study is limited by the lack of randomization to treatment group; placement was based on year of birth. One large observational study in infants fed a mix of human milk and formula, but not strictly human milk or formula, suggests that taking L. acidophilus 1 to 3 billion CFUs with Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis during the first month of life for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis was associated with a 31% reduction in the development of clinical sepsis. The infants in this study were born between 22-29 weeks gestation and had a birthweight of less than 1500 grams (111771).\nless\nShort bowel syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral Lactobacillus acidophilus for short bowel syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lactobacillus for this condition.\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children with chronic diarrhea due to SIBO shows that taking a combination of lyophilized L. acidophilus 1.5 grams and Lacticaseibacillus casei 1.5 grams by mouth twice daily for 21 days decreases average daily stools by 1.5, but does not improve other symptoms, when compared with placebo (91143). Also, one preliminary clinical study shows that taking a total of 2 billion CFUs of L. acidophilus and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (Lacidofil) daily for 4 weeks does not prevent the development of SIBO in children that started treatment with omeprazole 20 mg daily for epigastric pain (90262).\nless\nTravelers' diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus acidophilus is beneficial for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea.\nA meta-analysis which included three clinical studies evaluating the use of L. acidophilus in adults traveling to different parts of the world found no benefit for the prevention of travelers' diarrhea when compared with placebo (101445). The effectiveness of this species may vary significantly based upon the destination of travel. Destinations in the same country can have different results, probably due to differences in bacteria and other microorganisms at different locations (10216).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nThe best evidence of benefit is for a specific combination product (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma). Doses of 3 grams (equivalent to 900 billion colony-forming units (CFUs)) once or twice daily have been used in combination with conventional treatment. In children aged 1-16 years, doses of 450-1800 billion CFUs for up to one year have been used (3261, 14370, 14371, 16841, 95337). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking this product as an adjunct to standard ulcerative colitis treatment can increase remission rates in adults and children by about 1.7-fold when compared with standard treatment alone (95337). Preliminary clinical research in patients with moderate to severe symptoms taking mesalazine 1200 mg daily shows that taking an unknown dose of L. acidophilus twice daily along with Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 and Ligilactobacillus salivarius (Acronelle, Bromatech srl, Milan, Italy) for 2 years modestly improves patient- and physician-scales of overall symptoms when compared with taking mesalazine alone. There were also improvements in stool frequency and rectal bleeding (110981). Although some contradictory evidence exists (3261, 16841), most research shows that taking Visbiome or a combination of L. acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (Probio-Tec AB-25) does not prevent relapse in people who are already in remission (95337, 95338).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn children aged 4 months to 5 years with a previous UTI, clinical research shows that taking a specific combination of L. acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (Complete Probiotic Platinum) for 18 months increases the median time to the first incidence of recurrence by approximately 3 months and increases the percentage of children without a UTI during the study period from 83% to 97% (103436).\nless\nVaginal candidiasis. It is unclear if oral or intravaginal Lactobacillus acidophilus is beneficial for vaginal candidiasis.\nIn a small preliminary clinical trial in patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis who had undergone a week of oral fluconazole treatment followed by intravaginal L. acidophilus LA 02 and Limosilactobacillus fermentum LF10, 72.4% of patients demonstrated a lack of clinical recurrence over a 7 month observational period. All patients took fluconazole 200 mg three times in the first week followed by intravaginal application with at least 0.4 billion colony-forming units each of L. acidophilus LA 02 and Limosilactobacillus fermentum LF10, along with arabinogalactan and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on alternate days for 10 days and then once weekly for 10 weeks (111781). However, a combination of L. acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus (Femilac) given intravaginally, does not seem to reduce the risk of vaginal candidiasis infection following use of antibiotics (12108). There is also some evidence that eating yogurt enriched with L. acidophilus daily does not reduce the risk of recurrent vaginal candidiasis (1245).\nless\nVentilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Oral Lactobacillus acidophilus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking L. acidophilus LA-5 1.75 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 500 million CFUs, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB12 1.75 billion CFUs, and Saccharomyces boulardii 1.5 billion CFUs twice daily for 15 days reduces the risk of VAP to 12%, compared with 28% in those taking placebo. Half of the dose was given onto the oropharynx and half via a nasogastric tube (107524).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection. It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus acidophilus is beneficial for preventing C. difficile occurrence or recurrence.\nCurrent guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) state that there is insufficient information to recommend administration of probiotics for the primary prevention of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (107538). Evidence from clinical and observational research investigating the effect of L. acidophilus on C. difficile occurrence or recurrence is weak. Most studies use this species in combination with one or more additional probiotic species, including as Bio-K+ CI1285, containing L. acidophilus CL1285 and L. casei LBC80R, and as Bio-K+ 50 Billion, containing L. acidophilus CL1285, Lacticaseibacillus casei LBC80R, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus CLR2 (25494, 90231, 90934, 95369, 95403, 107529). Observational research has found that providing the Bio-K+ 50 Billion product as 50-100 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 5 days to patients who are on antibiotics for at least 2 days reduces the hospital-wide incidence of C. difficile by approximately 40%. The incidence rate was decreased by at least 50% in the highest risk individuals taking this combination (107529).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Lactobacillus acidophilus for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLactobacillus acidophilus is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, homofermentive, anaerobic bacteria. L. acidophilus is indigenous to the human intestinal tract, mouth, and vagina (90605, 101513, 111793). It is also found in foods such as sourdough and wine (101513).\n\nL. acidophilus is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605). Most researchers agree that the effectiveness of L. acidophilus and other probiotics for all indications depends on its ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAntibiotic adverse effect prevention\nIt is theorized that taking probiotics during antibiotic treatment can prevent or minimize normal flora depletion and pathogenic bacteria colonization. There is some evidence to support this theory (5500, 11382). However, there is some evidence that Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG attaches to intestinal epithelial cells better than L. acidophilus (4373).\n\nWhen probiotics latch on to and colonize the intestinal and urogenital mucosa, it seems to prevent epithelial attachment by pathogenic bacteria. This prevention may be partially related to the production of lactic acid (4369, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092). L. acidophilus might also inhibit the translocation of bacteria across the intestinal mucosa by strengthening the epithelial barrier and by promoting accelerated epithelial repair (8516). Most researchers agree that the effectiveness of lactobacilli and other probiotics for all indications depends on their ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, lactobacillus preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut and then they must be able to latch on to the intestinal epithelium. Various strains and preparations might vary in their effectiveness due to differences in their ability to adhere to the epithelial cells.\n\nSince probiotic strains may differ in specific metabolic activities, and not all species inhibit a wide range of pathogenic bacteria (6093), some researchers theorize that probiotic preparations containing several species might offer more benefit than a single species (6087, 6094). However, this theory has not yet been evaluated in studies.\nAnticancer effects\nThere is some preliminary evidence that Lactobacillus acidophilus might help protect against cancer. In animal models, L. acidophilus has been shown to decrease development of tumors in the colon after carcinogen challenge (4387).\nAntioxidant effects\nClinical research in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium bifidum for 6 weeks increases total antioxidant capacity and reduces C-reactive protein levels, plasma malondialdehyde levels, and the oxidative stress index. This activity is hypothesized to be caused by improved insulin sensitivity and an upregulation of antioxidative enzymes (98430).\nCardiovascular effects\nFermented dairy products, such as yogurt and milk containing Lactobacillus acidophilus seem to have a beneficial effect on cholesterol levels. Probiotic bacteria seem to bind bile acids to cholesterol, resulting in increased bile acid-cholesterol excretion. They also seem to increase fatty acid production in the intestine, which decreases circulatory fatty acid concentrations either by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis or redistributing cholesterol from the plasma to the liver (8559).\nGastrointestinal effects\nProbiotics including Lactobacillus acidophilus are being used for pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. Some evidence suggests that patients who develop pouchitis have a low number of bacteria, but a high number of fungal flora in the mucosa of the pouch. Treatment with a specific combination probiotic containing L. acidophilus and other probiotics (Visbiome, ExeGi Pharma) seems to decrease fungal flora and increase bacterial flora, including modification towards more anaerobic flora (14376). Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that intake of L. acidophilus NCFM, alone or in combination with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, tends to improve symptoms of functional abdominal pain. This effect is attributed to increased expression of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) in the colon (90287).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSome researchers think probiotics might have immunomodulating effects (4368, 4369, 8512).. Lactobacilli seem to modulate non-specific cellular and humoral immunity possibly by stimulating lymphocyte and macrophage activity (6089, 8565) and modulating cytokine production by mononuclear cells (4379, 8512, 105137). They also seem to decrease markers of hypersensitivity reactions and intestinal inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (4369, 11383). Some lactobacilli also seem to stimulate the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which protects against allergy (7743). In atopic dermatitis, lactobacilli might reduce serum levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL27 which attract T-cells to the skin (17117). They also appear to enhance synthesis of antibodies in response to microbial pathogens, particularly secretory immunoglobulin A (7754, 105137).\n\nLactobacillus acidophilus seems to stimulate macrophage activity (6089). Whether L. acidophilus administration can increase resistance to disease is unknown. Some preliminary research suggests that L. acidophilus and other probiotics might inhibit pathogens such as Candida albicans and prolong survival in immune deficiency states (7746). However, in healthy males given a live enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection, taking L. acidophilus does not seem to reduce symptoms, or improve measures of inflammation or immune markers (111784).\nVaginal health effects\nHydrogen-peroxide producing probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, may be bactericidal to the vaginal pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis. Their presence in the vagina has been associated with decreased frequencies of bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis (7745). In the vagina, lactic acid, produced from probiotics such as L. acidophilus, lowers vaginal pH, which can prevent pathogen growth. These bacteria also produce substances called bacteriocins that can inhibit growth of some bacteria and fungi, and biosurfactants that can prevent some bacteria from adhering to the epithelium (6089, 6090, 6091, 6096, 8514)."

Some lactobacilli species have been isolated in cases of bacteremia, sepsis, splenic abscess, endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, pancreatic necrosis, and meningoencephalitis. These cases are thought to be due to the translocation of bacteria from other locations in the body in which they occur naturally, such as the oral cavity, or the gastrointestinal or urogenital tract, and not to dietary or supplemental intake (107543, 110917, 110918, 110920, 110921).\n\nThere are various cases of L. delbrueckii urinary tract infections (UTI) (112553, 112557, 112558). In one case, a L. delbrueckii UTI occurred in an 82-year-old male with benign prostate hyperplasia and related urinary retention (112553). Any use of probiotic products containing L. delbrueckii was not mentioned in this report. In one case, a 49-year-old male with a L. delbrueckii UTI reported daily yogurt intake, possibly fermented with L. delbrueckii. He had urinary retention in the absence of benign prostate hypertrophy and initially presented with acute bacterial prostatitis (112557). Most cases of UTIs have occurred in older females. An 85-year-old female with recurrent UTIs denied probiotic use; however, exposure via ingested foods was possible (112558).\nless",

Oral Lactobacillus delbrueckii has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) total of L. delbrueckii along with six other probiotics (Balance, Protexin Co., UK) twice daily in conjunction with bismuth quadruple therapy does not seem to improve H. pylori eradication rates when compared with placebo and bismuth quadruple therapy (90291). Other clinical research shows that taking yogurt providing L. delbrueckii 100,000 CFUs and Streptococcus thermophilus for one week prior to triple therapy treatment for H. pylori infection increases the eradication rate by up to 10% when compared with a placebo yogurt and triple therapy. However, taking the yogurt was not effective for reducing medication-related adverse effects (112555).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Ltd.) containing L. delbrueckii, Bifidobacterium longum, and Enterococcus faecium 3 capsules twice daily for up to 7 weeks modestly reduces the incidence of severe oral mucositis when compared with placebo (102413). A small clinical study in patients with Candida-associated oral mucositis shows that, in addition to topical antifungal therapy, taking four 500-mg lozenges, with each lozenge containing L. delbrueckii 500,000 colony-forming units (CFUs), Streptococcus thermophilus 500,000 CFUs, and Bifidobacterium longum 5 million CFUs, 3 times daily for 4 weeks does not reduce symptoms to a greater extent than topical antifungal therapy alone (102432).\nless\nPouchitis. Oral Lactobacillus delbrueckii has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a specific product (Trilac, Allergon AB) containing L. delbrueckii 400 million colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus acidophilus 600 million CFUs, and Bifidobacterium bifidum 600 million CFUs per capsule can reduce pouchitis severity and the number of patients experiencing pouchitis when compared to baseline. This product was taken in doses of 2 capsules 3 times daily for the first month followed by 1 capsule twice daily for 8 months (90296). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral Lactobacillus delbrueckii has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking probiotics during pregnancy reduces the severity and duration of nausea and vomiting by 16% to 54%. There was also a small benefit on stool hardness. A specific probiotic (Probiotics 10, Nature's Bounty) was taken as 2 capsules daily for two back-to-back cycles of six days with probiotics and 2 days without. Each capsule contained a total of 10 billion colony-forming units of L. delbrueckii Lb-87, Ligilactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v and DSM 15312, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DSM 13434 and Lpc-37, Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-35, Lacticaseibacillus casei Lc-11, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04, along with inulin 200 mg (107199).\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. Oral Lactobacillus delbrueckii has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy shows that taking 96 mL fermented milk (Danone) 3 times daily, containing L. delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DN-114 001 starting one week before the initiation of radiation treatment does not delay the development of diarrhea when compared with taking a control sterilized milk product. The fermented milk was continued throughout treatment (112513).\nless\nVaginal candidiasis. Vaginal Lactobacillus delbrueckii has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that a combination of L. delbrueckii, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (Femilac) given intravaginally, does not seem to reduce the risk of vaginal candidiasis infection following use of antibiotics when compared with placebo (12108).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLactobacillus delbrueckii is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. It is found naturally in humans. L. delbrueckii is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605, 101513).\nAntibiotic adverse effect prevention\nIt is theorized that taking probiotics during antibiotic treatment can prevent or minimize normal flora depletion and pathogenic bacteria colonization. There is some evidence to support this theory (5500, 11382). When probiotics latch on to and colonize the intestinal and urogenital mucosa, it seems to prevent epithelial attachment by pathogenic bacteria. This prevention may be partially related to the production of lactic acid (4369, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092). Since probiotic strains may differ in specific metabolic activities, and not all species inhibit a wide range of pathogenic bacteria (6093), some researchers theorize that probiotic preparations containing several species might offer more benefit than a single species (6087, 6094). However, this theory has not yet been evaluated in studies.\nImmunomodulating effects\nSome researchers think probiotics might have immunomodulating effects (4368, 4369, 8512). Lactobacilli seem to modulate non-specific cellular and humoral immunity possibly by stimulating lymphocyte and macrophage activity (6089, 8565) and modulating cytokine production by mononuclear cells (4379, 8512, 105137). They also seem to decrease markers of hypersensitivity reactions and intestinal inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (4369, 11383). Some lactobacilli also seem to stimulate the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which protects against allergy (7743). In atopic dermatitis, lactobacilli might reduce serum levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL27 which attract T-cells to the skin (17117). They also appear to enhance synthesis of antibodies in response to microbial pathogens, particularly secretory immunoglobulin A (7754, 105137).\n\nSome strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii seem to have immunomodulatory effects in humans and animals. In adults 65 years and older, taking L. delbrueckii 8481 increased the percentage of natural killer cells and modified the T cell profile towards immature cell populations. The level of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-8 was also reduced (112547). In residents of nursing homes, consuming yogurt fermented with L. delbrueckii OLL1073R-1 or OLL1256 increases salivary levels of Immunoglobulin A. Specifically consuming L. delbrueckii OLL1073R-1 increases salivary levels of influenza A virus subtype H3N2-bound IgA (112560). These products also contained an unknown quantity of Streptococcus thermophilus strains. It is unclear if this species played a role in any potential effects. In an animal wound healing model, topical L. delbrueckii reduces inflammatory cell counts and increases fibroblast counts during the healing process (112559)."

However, L. gasseri continues to be classified under the Lactobacillus genus and has not undergone a name change.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC): Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, there is no evidence that L. gasseri is beneficial for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",

Oral and vaginal Lactobacillus gasseri have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical trial shows that using vaginal capsules (EcoVag Vaginal Capsules, Bifodan A/S) containing L. gasseri and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, 100 million to 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of each strain per capsule, following conventional treatment for 10 days in three subsequent menstrual cycles, increases the time from cure to relapse when compared with placebo. However, cure rates were not significantly improved in the first month of treatment (16745). Also, a combination product containing L. gasseri has been tried in patients with both bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis, which typically occurs after unsuccessful treatment of bacterial vaginosis with antibiotics. A clinical study in these patients shows that taking a specific combination product (prOVag, IBSS BIOMED S.A.) containing a total of 100 million CFUs of L. gasseri 57C, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 57B, and Limosilactobacillus fermentum 57A daily for 10 days in conjunction with standard metronidazole treatment increases the duration of symptom-free remission to 71 days, compared with 47 days in those taking metronidazole alone (99784).\nless\nCommon cold.

It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus gasseri is beneficial for gastroparesis.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate delayed gastric emptying shows that taking L. gasseri OLL2716 1 billion colony-forming units daily in yogurt for 12 weeks does not affect the overall condition or the average time to gastric emptying of a liquid test meal when compared with placebo yogurt. However, the odds of having a clinically relevant improvement in gastric emptying rate were increased by about 4-fold. Patients with severe gastroparesis were excluded from this study (112575). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect some differences between groups.\nless\nGout. It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus gasseri is beneficial for gout.\nA small clinical trial in patients with hyperuricemia and/or gout shows that taking L. gasseri PA-3 8.5 billion colony-forming units daily in a yogurt beverage for 8 weeks does not reduce serum uric acid levels in most individuals when compared with control yogurt. Patients discontinued urate lower medications starting 4 weeks prior to this study (112593). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus gasseri is beneficial for H. pylori symptoms or eradication.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with H. pylori infections shows that taking L. gasseri OLL2716 1 billion colony-forming units twice daily in yogurt for 4 weeks, starting 3 weeks prior to triple therapy, results in an 82.6% overall eradication rate compared to 69.3% of those given only triple therapy (90244). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus gasseri is beneficial for IBS.\nA small clinical trial in patients with IBS shows that taking L. gasseri CP2305 130 million colony-forming units daily in fermented milk powder for 4 weeks modestly reduces IBS symptom severity, and improves fecal characteristics and the number of bowel movements, when compared with placebo (112594).\nless\nJapanese cedar pollinosis. It is unclear if oral heat-killed Lactobacillus gasseri is beneficial for Japanese cedar pollinosis.\nClinical research in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis shows that taking tablets containing heat-killed L. gasseri OLL2809 10 billion cells daily for 8 weeks does not reduce symptoms in the overall population when compared with placebo. However, in the patients with the highest Japanese cedar pollen-specific IgE, nasal symptoms and the specific IgE levels were modestly reduced (112589).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral heat-killed Lactobacillus gasseri is beneficial for menopausal symptoms.\nClinical research in females ages 40-60 years shows that taking tablets containing heat-killed L. gasseri CP2305 10 billion cells daily for 6 consecutive menstrual cycles modestly improves perimenopausal symptoms when compared with placebo. The proportion of individuals with improvements in overall symptoms increased by up to 36%. However, the effect of taking L. gasseri on specific symptoms is unclear due to discrepant findings between questionnaires. The individuals in this study had mild climacteric symptoms and regular menstrual cycles (112582).\nless\nObesity. Most research shows that oral Lactobacillus gasseri is beneficial for weight loss. However, it is unclear if any benefits are clinically significant.\nClinical research in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking L. gasseri BNR17 1 billion or 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily in divided doses for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), total fat percentage, or waist or hip circumference when compared with placebo, although it did produce a modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue. There was no effect on lipid or glycemic indices (98433). Other clinical research in adults with increased visceral fat shows that taking L. gasseri SBT2055 200 million or 2 billion CFUs daily in fermented milk for 12 weeks modestly reduces visceral fat area, BMI, fat mass, and waist and hip circumference when compared with a fermented milk lacking in L. gasseri (112588). However, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant.\nless\nStress. It is unclear if oral heat-killed Lactobacillus gasseri is beneficial for acute or chronic stress.\nA small clinical trial in adults with acute stress shows that taking heat-killed L. gasseri CP2305 10 billion cells daily in fermented milk for 5 weeks modestly improves sleep quality when compared with a placebo milk. In males, but not females, there was also a modest improvement in stress-associated diarrhea, sleep latency, and sleep duration (112581). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect some differences between groups. Another small clinical trial in adults with chronic stress shows that taking tablets containing this strain of heat-killed L. gasseri 10 billion cells daily for 24 weeks modestly reduces feelings of anxiety and depression and improves sleep quality when compared with placebo (102297).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Lactobacillus gasseri for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nWhen taken orally, Lactobacillus gasseri is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Some preparations of L. gasseri may behave as probiotics and colonize the large bowel (90605).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLactobacillus gasseri is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. It is found naturally in humans. L. gasseri is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605, 101513).\nGastrointestinal effects\nLactobacillus gasseri is of interest for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the mechanism of action is unclear, there is some evidence in humans suggesting that taking L. gasseri increases the expression of various genes involved in cellular signaling in peripheral leukocytes and these changes are associated with clinical improvements (112594).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSome researchers think probiotics might have immunomodulating effects (4368, 4369, 8512).. Lactobacilli seem to modulate non-specific cellular and humoral immunity possibly by stimulating lymphocyte and macrophage activity (6089, 8565) and modulating cytokine production by mononuclear cells (4379, 8512, 105137). They also seem to decrease markers of hypersensitivity reactions and intestinal inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (4369, 11383). Some lactobacilli also seem to stimulate the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which protects against allergy (7743). In atopic dermatitis, lactobacilli might reduce serum levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL27 which attract T-cells to the skin (17117). They also appear to enhance synthesis of antibodies in response to microbial pathogens, particularly secretory immunoglobulin A (7754, 105137).\n\nThere is limited evidence specific to Lactobacillus gasseri. L. gasseri is of interest for allergies and respiratory illnesses. In adults ages 50-70 years, taking heat-killed L. gasseri TMC0356 (TMC0356) increases the number of cytotoxic T cells (112592). It is unclear if this translates to immunomodulating effects or whether live L. gasseri has similar benefits.\nMetabolic dysfunction effects\nLactobacillus gasseri is of interest for metabolic dysfunction, including metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. In an animal diabetic model, L. gasseri has anti-inflammatory effects, possibly by reducing inflammation at the gut lining. Serum levels of some inflammatory cytokines are reduced. L. gasseri also reduces levels of free fatty acids and increases levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood. In the pancreas, transcription of genes coding for the insulin proteins are also increased (112583).\nVaginal health effects\nHydrogen-peroxide producing lactobacilli are bactericidal to the vaginal pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis, and their presence in the vagina has been associated with decreased frequencies of bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis (7745). In the vagina, lactic acid from lactobacilli lowers vaginal pH, which can prevent pathogen growth. Lactobacilli might also produce substances called bacteriocins that can inhibit growth of some bacteria and fungi, and biosurfactants that can prevent some bacteria from adhering to the epithelium (6089, 6090, 6091, 6096, 8514). In an animal model, Lactobacillus gasseri reduces levels of G. vaginalis, as well as exfoliation of vaginal epithelial cells, inflammatory cell infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine levels. In vitro, L. gasseri inhibits the adhesion and biofilm formation of G. vaginalis (112590). Whether L. gasseri is beneficial in humans for this purpose is unclear. One clinical study shows that vaginal L. gasseri alone does not modulate the vaginal microbiome (111999). However, when used in combination with other probiotics, vaginal L. gasseri increased and pH was decreased (111961).\nWeight loss effects\nLactobacillus gasseri is of interest for weight loss (98433, 112588). In an animal obesity model, L. gasseri has resulted in weight loss and reductions in subcutaneous and abdominal fat. This is associated with changes in the expression of fatty acid oxidation- and fatty acid synthesis-related genes, as well as reduced serum levels of leptin and insulin (112585). In humans, the effect of L. gasseri is unclear. Taking L. gasseri has had mixed effects on overall weight or fat loss. However, visceral fat is reduced by a small amount (98433, 112588)."

However, there was no significant difference between groups on subjective feelings of sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, or tearing severity, or on symptoms as evaluated by the physician. The fermented milk provided at least one billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of L. helveticus (110926 ).\nless\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. Oral Lactobacillus helveticus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a combination of L. helveticus R0052 0.4 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011 7.6 billion CFUs (Lacidofil STRONG, Lallemand Health Solutions) daily during antibiotic treatment reduces the duration of diarrhea-like defecations by one day when compared with taking placebo.

Oral Lactobacillus helveticus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking a product containing a combination of L. helveticus R0052 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum R1012 800 million CFUs, and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 70 million CFUs (Puraflor, GSK Consumer Healthcare, Milano, Italy) daily for 4 weeks does not affect cognitive performance during acute stress when compared with placebo. The probiotics were provided in combination with inulin 500 mg, potassium 50 mg, magnesium 45 mg, glutathione 20 mg, lactoferrin 10 mg, and zinc 9 mg (110923 ). The effects of L. helveticus alone are not clear from this study. Also, a larger clinical trial is needed to confirm these results.\nless\nDepression. Oral Lactobacillus helveticus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of major depressive disorder shows that taking a total of 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of L. helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum daily modestly improves symptoms of depression when compared with placebo, but not when compared with the prebiotic galactooligosaccharide. All patients had been taking antidepressants for at least 3 months (102506) Also, preliminary clinical research in treatment-naïve patients with moderate depression shows that taking 2.7 billion CFUs of L. helveticus in combination with 0.3 billion CFUs of B. longum daily modestly improves symptoms of depression and sleep quality when compared with baseline (105129). However, a larger clinical trial in untreated patients with depression shows that taking a total of 3 billion CFUs of L. helveticus and B. longum does not improve symptoms of depression when compared with placebo.

            "Overview": "Lactobacillus johnsonii is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. It is found naturally in humans. Specific strains are found as probiotics in supplements and functional foods. Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605, 101513, 110931, 110936). Probiotics are often marketed for various purposes, including allergies and gastrointestinal health.",
            "Warnings": "In April 2020, the genus Lactobacillus was reclassified into 25 different genera (101513). However, L. johnsonii continues to be classified under the Lactobacillus genus and has not undergone a name change. One specific strain of L. johnsonii, L. johnsonii La1 was previously known as L. acidophilus La1.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, there is no evidence that L. johnsonii is beneficial for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 has been safely used in doses of up to 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily in clinical trials lasting up to 12 weeks (110929) or in doses of 4 billion CFUs daily for up to 6 months (14377).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of non-viable, heat-killed L. johnsonii formulations when used orally.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children of most ages. Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 has been used safely in infants in doses of approximately 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily in formula for 4 weeks (110937). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of L. johnsonii in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608). There is insufficient reliable information about the safety of non-viable, heat-killed L. johnsonii formulations in children when taken orally.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Lactobacillus johnsonii during pregnancy and lactation.

Some lactobacilli species have been isolated in cases of bacteremia, sepsis, splenic abscess, endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, pancreatic necrosis, and meningoencephalitis. Most of these cases are thought to be due to the translocation of bacteria from other locations in the body in which they occur naturally, such as the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, and not to dietary or supplemental intake (107543).\nless",

Two small clinical trials suggest that oral Lactobacillus johnsonii does not prevent endoscopic recurrence following resection in patients with Crohn disease.\nA small clinical trial in patients with Crohn disease shows that taking L. johnsonii LA1 (Nestec, Nestle, Verschez-les blancs, Lausanne, Switzerland) 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 12 weeks starting after ileo-caecal resection does not affect the post-treatment endoscopic recurrence or clinical relapse rates when compared with taking placebo (110929). An additional clinical trial in patients who had undergone surgical resection of less than 1 meter in the past 3 weeks shows that taking L. johnsonii LA1 2 billion CFUs twice daily for 6 months does not prevent endoscopic or clinical recurrence when compared with taking placebo (14377). Larger studies are needed to confirm these results.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus johnsonii is beneficial in children with allergic rhinitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 7-12 years with moderate to severe perennial allergic rhinitis related to house dust mite shows that taking L. johnsonii EM1 (TTY Biopharm Com. Taiwan) 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) in combination with levocetirizine 5 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly improves overall symptoms, as well as nasal congestion and conjunctival itching, when compared with taking levocetirizine alone. There was no difference between groups for other individual symptoms, quality of life, or lung function. During a subsequent 12-week crossover treatment period, children switched from levocetirizine alone to levocetirizine plus L. johnsonii continued to improve; however, there was no further improvement in children switched to levocetirizine alone and there was no significant difference between groups during this period (90273). This crossover study is limited by the lack of washout time between treatment periods.\nless\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus johnsonii is beneficial in patients with constipation.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with mild constipation shows that taking fermented milk containing L. johnsonii La1 one billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 3 weeks increases the number of defecations per week by 2.1. However, it is unclear if changes were statistically significant when compared with fermented milk without L. johnsonii (110933).\nless\nDiarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral Lactobacillus johnsonii for diarrhea prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. johnsonii for this purpose.\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral Lactobacillus johnsonii is beneficial in children with H. pylori infection.\nClinical research in H. pylori-colonized children aged 6 to 17 years shows that taking a commercial fermented dairy product containing live L. johnsonii La1 (Chamyto, Nestle´-Chile SA, Santiago, Chile) 1.6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) five days each week for 4 weeks modestly reduces H. pylori colonization when compared with baseline. However, changes in H. pylori colonization did not differ between children taking the fermented beverage containing live or heat-treated L. johnsonii or vehicle. The beverages were fermented with Lactobacillus helveticus (110934).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Although there has been interest in using oral Lactobacillus johnsonii for respiratory tract infection prevention, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. johnsonii for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate Lactobacillus johnsonii for these uses.",

It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605, 101513, 110931, 110936). Most researchers agree that the effectiveness of L. johnsonii and other probiotics for all indications depends on its ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAnti-Helicobacter pylori effects\nLactobacillus johnsonii is of interest for the treatment of H. pylori colonization (110934). In vitro and in animal research, a specific acid-resistant strain of this species, L. johnsonii No. 1088, had anti-bacterial effects against H. pylori. In animal research, this strain also suppressed gastrin-induced gastric acid secretion (110931).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe systemic antioxidant effects of lactobacilli such as Lactobacillus johnsonii may play a role in its potential clinical effects. In animal research, heat-killed L. johnsonii seems to reduce lipid peroxidation (110928).\nImmunological effects\nProbiotic bacteria has been suggested to affect the immune system by changing gut permeability. The Lactobacillus johnsonii cell wall glycoconjugates and other components play a role in adhesion to tight junctions in the gut lining (110930, 110933, 110935). In colorectal cells in vitro, L. johnsonii upregulates the expression of genes involved in the repair of damaged tight junctions (110935). In humans, taking L. johnsonii La1 for 28 days resulted in a small increase in serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) A. However, there was no effect on jejunal Ig or protein secretions, suggesting that there was no effect on the permeability of the jejunum (110938). In children with allergic rhinitis, taking L. johnsonii does not seem to affect eosinophil count or IgE levels (90273).\n\nL. johnsonii might also protect immune function in the skin. Human research shows that taking L. johnsonii La1 prior to ultraviolet exposure may protect against skin damage by preventing UV-induced changes in inflammatory and immune cells in the dermis (110939, 110940).\nProbiotic effects\nIn human research, oral Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 increased levels of fecal lactic acid, L. johnsonii La1, and total levels of Bifidobacterium and lactobacilli, while decreasing fecal pH. Pathogenic lecithinase-positive Clostridium was decreased (110933).\nVaginal effects\nLactic acid bacteria are of interest for vaginal health. In animal research, both oral and intravaginal Lactobacillus johnsonii HY7042 inhibited Gardnerella vaginalis-induced vaginosis and inhibited the vaginal and systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vitro, L. johnsonii was found to have bacteriocidal effects (110936)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nPregnancy-related iron deficiency. Oral lactoferrin seems to improve hemoglobin levels similarly to oral or parenteral iron therapy in patients with pregnancy-related iron deficiency.\nA meta-analysis of 4 clinical studies in patients with pregnancy-related iron deficiency anemia shows that taking bovine lactoferrin 200-250 mg daily for 4-8 weeks during the second or third trimester is equally effective to ferrous sulfate 150-520 mg for improving hemoglobin levels (97788). Another meta-analysis of 6 mostly small, low-quality clinical studies in pregnant patients with iron deficiency anemia, iron deficiency, or hereditary thrombophilia shows that taking lactoferrin improves hemoglobin and serum iron, but not serum ferritin, when compared with ferrous sulfate (110773). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and lack of information about lactoferrin and iron doses.\nless\nSepsis. Oral lactoferrin seems to reduce the risk of late-onset sepsis in some premature infants. However, the optimal dosing regimen and patient population is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of 12 clinical studies in premature infants shows that lactoferrin 150-200 mg/kg daily reduces the risk of late-onset sepsis by 20%, largely due to reductions in fungal infections specifically (104868). In contrast, other meta-analyses have reported conflicting findings (97783, 104856) and some suggest that any benefits may be relegated to certain sub-groups of premature infants, including infants fed with bovine formula (104856, 104868) or those with very low birth weight or extremely low birth weight (104856, 104868, 104869). These groups seemed to obtain greater benefits than other premature infants or those fed exclusively or almost exclusively with breast milk. Early data from one meta-analysis also suggests that lactoferrin may be more effective at preventing late-onset sepsis when combined with probiotics (104868). Fixed doses of 100-250 mg daily and weight-based doses up to 300 mg/kg daily have been studied (97783, 104856, 104868, 104869, 104870).\n\nHowever, many individual clinical studies, including 3 large studies, have failed to demonstrate clear benefits of lactoferrin. These clinical trials, one in very premature infants and the others in very low birthweight infants, show that lactoferrin 150 mg/kg daily, 200 mg/kg daily, or 100 mg daily does not reduce late-onset sepsis when compared with control (104857, 104858, 110771). Two of these trials had very few infants exclusively fed bovine formula, which may have limited potential benefits. Subgroup analyses from these trials also suggest that extremely low birth weight and/or extremely premature infants may have benefited from lactoferrin (104857, 104858).\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nFetal and premature infant mortality. Oral lactoferrin does not reduce the risk of all-cause mortality in premature infants.\nMany meta-analyses and large clinical trials show that taking lactoferrin does not reduce the risk of mortality from any cause in premature infants (104856, 104857, 104858, 104868, 110771).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Most research shows that oral lactoferrin does not reduce the incidence of NEC in premature infants.\nMany meta-analyses and large clinical studies show that lactoferrin does not reduce the incidence of NEC in premature infants (104856, 104857, 104858, 104868, 110771). Exploratory data from one meta-analysis suggest that lactoferrin combined with probiotics may reduce the incidence of NEC when compared with control (104868). However, since probiotics alone have demonstrated benefit for the prevention of NEC in clinical trials, it is unclear if lactoferrin confers any additional benefit.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Oral lactoferrin has only been studied in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study in adult females with acne shows that taking an oral supplement containing lactoferrin, zinc, niacinamide, and prebiotics once daily for 12 weeks, in addition to applying a topical combination retinoid-based cream, modestly improves the number of acne lesions (i.e., non-inflammatory, inflammatory, and total) when compared with the topical combination retinoid-based cream alone (112915). It is unclear if these effects are due to lactoferrin, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAnemia of chronic disease. Oral lactoferrin might improve hemoglobin levels in some patients with anemia of chronic disease. However, the optimal patient population is unclear.\nOne nonrandomized clinical study evaluated bovine lactoferrin in patients with anemia of chronic disease. In pregnant patients with anemia related to beta-thalassemia or hereditary thrombophilia, taking a specific bovine lactoferrin 100 mg capsule (Lattoglobina, Aqma Italia) twice daily with meals, starting at 6-8 weeks' gestation and continuing until delivery, improves hemoglobin levels by 50% and 15%, respectively, when compared with baseline. In non-pregnant patients, taking this same product twice daily for 30 days improves hemoglobin levels by 18% in patients with hereditary thrombophilia, but not in those with beta-thalassemia. The study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference from baseline (104865).\nless\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is unclear if oral lactoferrin is beneficial for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children or adults.\nA very small clinical study in long-term care patients shows that adding lactoferrin at an unspecified dose to 600 mL of gastronomy tube solution daily for 56 days reduces the risk for antibiotic-associated diarrhea when compared with placebo (97782). Conversely, a clinical study in children aged 1-18 years receiving antibiotic therapy for an acute respiratory or urinary tract infection shows that those taking bovine lactoferrin 100 mg twice daily are more than twice as likely to develop antibiotic-associated diarrhea during or for the two weeks following antibiotic therapy when compared with those taking placebo (106729). However, the validity of these findings is limited by differences in baseline characteristics between groups.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral lactoferrin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in adults with atopic dermatitis shows that taking a combination of lactoferrin 250 mg and a whey derived immunoglobulin-rich fraction 250 mg daily for 56 days improves symptoms in 13 of 22 patients, compared with 4 of 13 patients taking placebo (97789).\nless\nBacterial vaginosis. Oral lactoferrin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with recurrent bacterial vaginosis shows that adding a specific combination capsule (Respecta, Giellepi Spa Health Science) containing bovine lactoferrin 50 mg and 5 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus acidophilus GLA-14 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 on a varying schedule over 6 months, in conjunction with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, reduces the proportion of patients with vaginal discharge by 63%, itching by 57%, and a recurrent episode by 50% when compared with placebo. Patients took 2 capsules daily for 5 days, then 1 capsule daily for 10 days, followed by 1 capsule daily for 10 days of each month, beginning on the first day of the menstrual cycle. It is unclear if these effects are due to lactoferrin, other ingredients, or the combination (104872).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced anemia. It is unclear if oral lactoferrin is beneficial for chemotherapy-induced anemia.\nAn open-label clinical study in adults with advanced cancer and chemotherapy-induced anemia who are receiving treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin shows that taking oral lactoferrin (Lattoglobina, Grunenthal-Formenti) 200 mg daily for 12 weeks is as effective as intravenous ferric gluconate 125 mg weekly for improving hemoglobin and iron levels (97781).\nless\nCognitive function. Oral lactoferrin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking a product containing a combination of lactoferrin 10 mg, probiotics, prebiotics, minerals, and glutathione (Puraflor, GSK Consumer Healthcare, Milano, Italy) daily for 4 weeks does not affect cognitive performance during acute stress when compared with placebo (110923). It is unclear if this effect is due to lactoferrin, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCommon cold. It is unclear if oral lactoferrin is beneficial for preventing the common cold.\nA clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking bovine lactoferrin 200 mg or 600 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce the frequency or duration of self-reported symptoms of the common cold when compared with placebo (104859). Another clinical study in adults with frequent colds shows that taking a combination of bovine lactoferrin 400 mg and whey protein immunoglobulin-rich fraction 200 mg daily for 90 days reduces the number of colds by 57% when compared with placebo. There was no effect on cold severity (97786). It is not clear if this effect is due to lactoferrin, whey protein fraction, or the combination.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral lactoferrin is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.\nA small clinical study in adults hospitalized with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine, vitamin C, zinc, and acetylcysteine shows that taking lactoferrin 200 mg once or twice daily does not improve symptoms when compared with placebo (106731). Similarly, a large clinical study in adults hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 receiving standard therapy shows that taking a specific product containing bovine lactoferrin (Mosaic, Pharmaguida) 400 mg twice daily for 30 days does not reduce intensive care unit admission or death, nor improve illness severity scores or discharge within 2 weeks when compared with placebo (112913). However, observational research with this product in outpatient adults with asymptomatic to moderately symptomatic COVID-19 suggests that taking 200-1000 mg daily is associated with a median of 15 days to a negative SARS-CoV-2 test, compared with 24 days in a historical control group (106732). The validity of these findings is limited by the retrospective nature of the study and differences in symptom severity between the groups at baseline.\n\nThere is also interest in oral lactoferrin for prevention of COVID-19. A large clinical study conducted in healthcare workers in Peru who were screened and tested for COVID-19 shows that taking bovine lactoferrin 600 mg once daily for 65 days does not reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases when compared with placebo (112914). However, the study was stopped prematurely due to vaccine availability; it may not have been powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral lactoferrin is beneficial for reducing the incidence of diarrhea in children or adults.\nA large clinical study in weaned children 12-18 months of age shows that taking bovine lactoferrin 500 mg twice daily for 6 months does not reduce the incidence of diarrhea when compared with placebo (97787). However, a clinical study in infants with anemia who were exclusively breast-fed from 4-6 months before weaning and transitioning to infant formula from 6-9 months shows that fortification of each 100 grams of formula with 38 mg of bovine lactoferrin for 3 months improves vomiting and nausea when compared with formula without fortification. Similarly, fortification of each 100 grams of formula with 76 mg of bovine lactoferrin for 3 months improves diarrhea-related illness, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea when compared with formula without fortification (106726).\n\nLactoferrin has also been evaluated in adults. A large clinical study in healthy adults working at kindergartens or nursery schools in the winter shows that taking bovine lactoferrin 600 mg daily for 12 weeks is associated with a 1-day duration of diarrhea, compared with 2 days in those taking placebo (106728).\nless\nGingivitis. Oral lactoferrin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in adults with mild gingivitis shows that taking bovine lactoferrin 60 mg, bovine lactoperoxidase 7.8 mg, and glucose oxidase 7.8 mg daily for 12 weeks improves gingival health and plaque index scores when compared with placebo. A lower dose product containing bovine lactoferrin 20 mg, bovine lactoperoxidase 2.6 mg, and glucose oxidase 2.6 mg daily for 12 weeks improves plaque index scores, but not gingival health scores, when compared with placebo. It is unclear if these effects are due to lactoferrin, other ingredients, or the combination (104867).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Research on the use of oral lactoferrin as an adjunct for H. pylori eradication is inconclusive and conflicting.\nMonotherapy with human recombinant lactoferrin, even at high doses of 5 grams daily, does not suppress or eradicate H. pylori infection (13317). However, research on its use as an adjunct to standard therapy is conflicting. Some studies suggest that lactoferrin improves efficacy when added to a triple therapy regimen of rabeprazole, clarithromycin, and tinidazole (13316, 13332). However, research using lactoferrin with a triple therapy regimen of esomeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin found no difference in eradication rates. It is possible that lactoferrin activity on the bacterial cell wall interferes with the cell wall activity of amoxicillin (13315). Other research shows that using lactoferrin in addition to a sequential therapy regimen of esomeprazole, amoxicillin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin or a triple therapy regimen of esomeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin is associated with eradication rates of 95% or 86%, respectively, compared with eradication rates of 83% and 70%, respectively, with the use of either regimen alone (106730). However, using lactoferrin in addition to a sequential therapy regimen (esomeprazole, amoxicillin, tinidazole, and clarithromycin) and probiotics does not increase eradication more than sequential therapy and probiotics alone (97790).\nless\nHepatitis C. It is unclear if oral lactoferrin is beneficial for hepatitis C.\nSome clinical research shows that lactoferrin decreases serum levels of hepatitis C virus RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in adults with hepatitis C (13320, 13321). Some experts recommend starting lactoferrin 1 to 3 months before starting interferon to identify lactoferrin responders (13321, 13322, 13323, 13324). Lactoferrin doses of 1.8 or 3.6 grams daily appear to be necessary for efficacy (13323, 13324); lower doses don't seem to have any effect (13313, 13314).\nless\nInfant development. Oral lactoferrin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in healthy, full-term, exclusively formula-fed infants shows that taking a formula fortified with bovine lactoferrin 0.6 grams/L and bovine milk fat globule membrane 5 grams/L for 12 months improves cognitive development scores by about 8% after 12 months, but not after 18 months, when compared with control formula. This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups at 18 months. It is unclear if any effect is due to lactoferrin, milk fat globule membrane, or the combination (104866).\nless\nIron deficiency anemia. It is unclear if oral lactoferrin is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of iron deficiency anemia in infants and children.\nAn open-label clinical study in children aged 1-10 years with cerebral palsy and iron deficiency anemia shows that taking bovine lactoferrin (Pravotin, Hygint) 100 mg twice daily for 4 weeks improves hemoglobin by 1.4 grams/dL, compared with 0.8 grams/dL in those taking iron hydroxide polymaltose complex providing elemental iron 3 mg/kg twice daily. Lactoferrin also improves serum ferritin, but not the rest of the serum iron profile (106725). Conversely, a small open-label clinical study in children aged 1-18 years with iron deficiency anemia in Egypt shows that the improvement in hemoglobin, serum iron, ferritin, or transferrin saturation is less with lactoferrin 100 mg daily, or twice daily if over age 3, when compared with iron bisglycinate chelate 0.75 mg/kg daily or iron polymaltose complex 6 mg/kg daily for a month. However, improvement in hemoglobin and iron studies was similar when comparing 30% iron saturated lactoferrin (100 mg lactoferrin and 30 mg iron) daily, or twice daily if over age 3 years, with iron bisglycinate chelate or iron polymaltose complex (110189).\n\nLactoferrin has also been evaluated for the prevention of iron deficiency anemia. A clinical study in healthy, full-term formula-fed infants aged 6 weeks to 6 months shows that feeding a low-iron infant formula supplemented with lactoferrin has no effect on iron status or incidence of iron deficiency when compared with the low-iron formula alone (106724).\nless\nPreterm labor. It is unclear if vaginal lactoferrin is beneficial for preventing preterm labor.\nObservational research in patients diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis in the first trimester of pregnancy and a previous history of preterm labor has found that using a lactoferrin vaginal tablet 300 mg daily for 21 days is associated with a 44% reduced incidence of preterm birth when compared with no intervention. The validity of this study is limited by the use of a retrospective chart review (105405).\nless\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if topical lactoferrin is beneficial in psoriasis.\nA small open-label clinical study in patients with mild to moderate stable plaque-type psoriasis shows that applying lactoferrin 10% or 20% ointment topically daily in addition to taking bovine lactoferrin 100 mg orally daily (Lattoglobina, Grünenthal-Formenti) for 4 weeks improves symptoms of psoriasis, such as redness and scaling, by up to 37% when compared with use of oral lactoferrin alone (97784).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral lactoferrin is beneficial for treating or preventing respiratory tract infections.\nA clinical study in healthy children aged 12-32 months shows that taking bovine lactoferrin 48 mg daily for 13 weeks does not reduce symptoms of respiratory tract infections when compared with placebo (104861). However, a clinical study in infants with anemia who were exclusively breast-fed from 4-6 months before weaning and transitioning to infant formula from 6-9 months shows that fortification of each 100 grams of formula with 38 mg of bovine lactoferrin for 3 months improves rhinorrhea, wheezing, and skin rash when compared with formula without fortification. Similarly, fortification of each 100 grams of formula with 76 mg of bovine lactoferrin for 3 months improves respiratory-related illness and wheezing when compared with formula without fortification (106726).\n\nThere is also interest in oral lactoferrin for prevention of respiratory tract infections. However, two meta-analyses that each included 6 clinical studies in infants, children, and adults who consumed a bovine lactoferrin supplement or bovine lactoferrin enhanced formula, with some studies included in both analyses, have conflicting results. One meta-analysis of 1194 patients shows that lactoferrin reduces the risk of developing a respiratory infection by 43% when compared with placebo or various controls (110774). Conversely, the second meta-analysis of 1157 patients shows that lactoferrin does not reduce the risk of developing a respiratory infection in adults but may reduce the risk by 22% in infants and children when compared with placebo or unenhanced formula (110775). The validity of the findings from these meta-analyses is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, which enrolled patients of a broad age range and utilized widely varying dosing regimens. Furthermore, some studies are of poor quality.\nless\nVaginal candidiasis. Oral lactoferrin has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with recurrent vaginal candidiasis shows that taking a specific combination capsule (Respecta, Giellepi Spa Health Science) containing bovine lactoferrin 50 mg and 5 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus acidophilus GLA-14 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 on a varying schedule over 6 months, in conjunction with clotrimazole 100 mg daily for the first 7 days, reduces the proportion of patients with vaginal discharge by 63%, itching by 100%, and a recurrent infection by 71% when compared with placebo. Patients took 2 capsules daily for 5 days, then 1 capsule daily for 10 days, followed by 1 capsule daily for 10 days of each month, beginning during the premenstrual phase. It is unclear if these effects are due to lactoferrin, other ingredients, or the combination (104863).\nless\nVentilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). It is unclear if oral lactoferrin is beneficial for preventing VAP.\nA clinical study in critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults shows that taking lactoferrin 500 mg four times daily for up to 28 days does not reduce the incidence of VAP or other infections, or increase antibiotic-free days, when compared with placebo (104873).\nless\nGastroenteritis-associated nausea and vomiting. It is unclear if oral lactoferrin prevents the development of gastroenteritis-associated nausea and vomiting in children or adults.\nA large clinical study in children aged 3-6 years shows that consuming yogurt fortified with bovine lactoferrin 100 mg 3-5 days weekly for 15 weeks reduces the odds of school absence due to vomiting by 19% when compared with consuming the yogurt less than 3 days per week. However, consuming the yogurt did not reduce absences due to gastroenteritis, the presumed cause of vomiting (104862). A large clinical study in healthy adults working at kindergartens or nursery schools in the winter shows that taking bovine lactoferrin 200 or 600 mg daily for 12 weeks is associated with a 12% prevalence of acute gastrointestinal symptoms, compared with a prevalence of 22% in those taking placebo (106728).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate lactoferrin for these uses.",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with lactoferrin.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Distribution\nAfter oral consumption, bovine lactoferrin can be detected in neonatal plasma, saliva, stool, and urine (104871).\nExcretion\nIn neonates, the concentration of bovine lactoferrin in saliva and stool declines significantly within 12-24 hours after the last dose. Bovine lactoferrin cannot be detected in neonatal serum or other fluid excretions within 7 days of discontinuing treatment (104871).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein in the transferrin family. It has higher affinity for iron than serum transferrin. Lactoferrin is found in various body fluids, but is highest in colostrum and milk. In human milk, lactoferrin is the major whey protein. Human colostrum (the first postpartum milk produced) contains high levels of lactoferrin, up to 7 mg/mL. Mature milk has a lactoferrin content of about 1 mg/mL. Lactoferrin is produced by exocrine glands and is found in high concentrations in mucosal secretions including those of the eye, nose, throat, respiratory tract, and vagina. It is also in seminal fluid, saliva, and intestinal mucus. Lactoferrin is also produced and stored in some neutrophil granules (13324, 13327, 13328, 13329, 13330, 97788).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLactoferrin is used for skin and intestinal inflammatory disorders. Preliminary research suggests the small intestines have lactoferrin receptors. Binding of lactoferrin to its receptors might increase production of interleukin (IL)-18, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and caspase-1. In patients with hepatitis C, oral bovine lactoferrin is associated with increased levels of IL-18, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 (13324). In older adults, oral recombinant human lactoferrin does not reduce levels of IL-6 or soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (106733). However, a meta-analysis of small clinical studies in adults shows that lactoferrin supplementation reduces IL-6 but does not reduce levels of C-reactive protein (110775). The production of other cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1 beta, seem to be regulated by lactoferrin in laboratory models (97784).\n\nAnimal research suggests that lactoferrin protects the intestinal tract by blocking inflammation. Several mechanisms are proposed, including lactoferrin's ability to sequester iron, bind bacterial endotoxin, inhibit cytokine release, and reduce hydroxy radical production (13331, 97783). Other preliminary research suggests that lactoferrin might protect the small intestine from methotrexate toxicity by inhibiting epithelial cell proliferation (13332). In healthy volunteers, orally administered lactoferrin seems to lessen indomethacin-induced enteropathy, possibly through an antioxidant effect (13319).\n\nSystemic anti-inflammatory effects of lactoferrin are thought to be related to changes in cytokine production within the intestinal lining. These cytokines enter the circulation, influencing the activity of white blood cells (97783).\nAntibacterial effects\nLactoferrin has antibacterial activity through several mechanisms. It exerts a bacteriostatic effect by sequestering iron, which is essential for bacterial growth. Lactoferrin also has bactericidal effects by binding to the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on bacterial cell surfaces and causing cell lysis. It may also inhibit the adhesion and invasion of bacteria in host cells. Other preliminary research suggests a peptide in lactoferrin (LF-33) can neutralize bacterial endotoxin. Lactoferrin also might inhibit bacterial aggregation and biofilm development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans (13322, 13327, 13327, 13333, 97787). Some evidence suggests that lactoferrin might prevent the attachment of Helicobacter pylori to the stomach (13316, 13317, 13322, 13332, 13336). However, clinical research on the use of lactoferrin for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is mixed.\n\nIn vitro, lactoferricin B, a peptide derived from lactoferrin, has antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram positive and gram negative bacteria (2491). The lactoferrin constituent, lactoferricin, has activity against Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Staphylococcus aureus. Bovine lactoferricin appears to be more active than human, mouse, or goat lactoferricin (13328). The antibacterial effects of lactoferrin in animal models is thought to be related to the intestinal production of lactoferricin B during digestion (97783).\n\nLactoferrin has been evaluated in clinical research for the prevention of infections, with mixed results. Preliminary clinical research in adults on mechanical ventilators shows that taking lactoferrin 500 mg four times daily for up to 28 days does not prevent infections or increase antibiotic-free days when compared with placebo (104873). Additionally, preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking bovine lactoferrin 200-600 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce the frequency of infections, but may reduce the duration of infections by 33%, when compared with placebo (104859). Preliminary clinical research in healthy children aged 1-6 years also shows that taking lactoferrin 48-100 mg 3-7 days per week for up to 15 weeks does not prevent respiratory infection symptoms, but may reduce symptoms of gastrointestinal infections, when compared with control (104861, 104862).\n\nLactoferrin appears to confer antibacterial defense to breast-fed neonates (13324, 13325). Lactoferrin is in amniotic fluid and greatly increases with intrauterine infection (13326).\nAntifungal effects\nLactoferrin appears to have antifungal activity. Preliminary research suggests that it is active against Candida and Trichophyton species (13327).\nAntiviral effects\nLactoferrin has antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, respiratory syncytial virus, hantavirus, rotavirus, poliovirus, adenovirus, and enterovirus 71 (13324, 13327, 13334, 13335, 13340).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using lactoferrin for various skin conditions. Preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking lactoferrin 200-600 mg daily for 12 weeks improves self-reported skin moisture and texture scores. Lactoferrin 600 mg daily appears to be more effective than 200 mg daily (104860).\nImmune effects\nLactoferrin plays a role in immune system function. Its production is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli. It seems to bind with epithelial cells at the site of infection and inhibits inflammatory cytokine production (13330, 13339). Preliminary evidence suggests that lactoferrin supplementation might increase the phagocytic activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the proportion of natural killer (NK) cells in the host defense system (2490). However, a meta-analysis of 4 small clinical studies in adults shows that lactoferrin supplementation does not impact NK cell activity (110775). Lactoferrin is produced and stored in some neutrophil granules. It is released during neutrophil activation and degranulation in sites of infection or inflammation (13327).\n\nLevels of lactoferrin are lower in the serum of patients with HIV infection (13341). Deficiency of lactoferrin is associated with altered neutrophil functions, as well as recurrent bacterial infections and autoimmune diseases (13341).\nPrebiotic effects\nLactoferrin may have prebiotic effects, creating an environment for the growth of beneficial bacteria. In one case report, Lactobacillus was the predominant bacteria in the vaginal flora following use of lactoferrin 700 mg daily orally and 150 mg daily vaginally (97785).\nSleep effects\nA clinical study in healthy children aged 12-32 months shows that taking bovine lactoferrin 48 mg daily for 13 weeks improves morning symptoms, but not total score or scores of any other subdomains of the Japanese Sleep Questionnaire for Preschoolers (JSQ-P) survey, when compared with placebo (106727)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of lady's bedstraw are the above ground parts (99207). Constituents of lady's bedstraw include iridoid glycosides, flavonoids, anthraquinones, triterpenes, and phenolic compounds, including chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and hyperoside (99207, 105746).\nAnti-cancer effects\nLady's bedstraw is traditionally used as an anti-cancer agent. In vitro, lady's bedstraw has demonstrated cytotoxic effects against head and neck cancer cell lines. Lady's bedstraw inhibited the growth of cancer cells, possibly by a mechanism involving p-glycoprotein. The motility of cancer cells was also inhibited (99207).\nAntioxidant effects\nConstituents of lady's bedstraw have established antioxidant effects (99207). In a rat model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, pretreatment with a methanolic extract of lady's bedstraw for 4 weeks prior to injury alleviates oxidative stress-induced myocardial damage. Most prooxidant markers were reduced in cardiac tissue, including superoxide anion radicals, nitrites, and measures of lipid peroxidation. Additionally, antioxidant activity was upregulated in cardiac tissue, as measured by levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase (105746).\nCardioprotective effects\nA methanolic extract of lady's bedstraw seems to exert cardioprotective effects in a rat model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, the extract mitigates left ventricular hypertrophy and improves in vivo cardiac function. Pretreatment with the extract for 4 weeks prior to injury preserves cardiac contractility and coronary vasodilatory response, preserves and improves systolic function, and alleviates structural damage following a period of ischemia and reperfusion. These effects are thought to be due at least in part to the upregulation of antioxidant activity (105746)."

The average laminaria-based supplement might contain as much as 1000 mcg of iodine. Ingesting more than 1100 mcg iodine daily (the tolerable upper intake level) can cause hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or exacerbate existing hyperthyroidism (9556, 94046).

The concentration of arsenic in laminaria may vary between different batches, and also depends upon the part of the world where it was harvested (645, 10275, 15588). The concentration of arsenic has been reported to be higher in preparations from Australia than from Great Britain (645, 10275).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAbortion. Despite traditional use for the induction of second trimester abortion, most research shows that intravaginal laminaria does not significantly reduce time to delivery or improve abortion rates, and it may actually worsen some outcomes when compared with standard of care.\nOne clinical study shows that intravaginal administration of laminaria along with misoprostol does not improve second trimester abortion rates at 24 and 48 hours after treatment initiation when compared with using only misoprostol. Also, using laminaria along with misoprostol does not shorten delivery time when compared with misoprostol alone (95688). Another small clinical study shows that adding intravaginal laminaria to misoprostol therapy significantly increases induction time and the need for opioid analgesics when compared with misoprostol alone (109576). Also, a small clinical study in patients undergoing second trimester abortions shows that intravaginal laminaria increases pain with cervical ripening and induction-to-delivery time when compared with mifepristone (109577). A retrospective study in 126 patients undergoing second trimester abortions has found that intravaginal administration of laminaria (Dilateria, Cooper Surgical) one day before using misoprostol might actually prolong delivery time by about 6 hours and does not improve abortion rates at 24 hours after induction when compared with misoprostol alone (105806). Some research shows that intravaginal administration of laminaria (Dilateria, Milex Products Inc.) one day before using prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) suppositories to induce second trimester abortions shortens the delivery time by about 3 hours when compared with PGE2 suppositories alone; however, the incidence of febrile episodes is about 2.3-fold higher for patients treated with laminaria (94045). Also, one small clinical study shows that intravaginal administration of laminaria the night before a scheduled abortion reduces procedure time by around 4 minutes, increases cervical dilation at the time of abortion, and reduces the need for additional dilation when compared with misoprostol treatment on the day of abortion. However, more patients preferred misoprostol over laminaria (109575).\n\nLaminaria has also been compared with a mechanical cervical dilation device, called Dilapan-S. A small clinical study in patients undergoing second trimester surgical abortion shows that intravaginal administration of laminaria for cervical preparation has no effect on pain scores or analgesic use following dilator placement or dilation and evacuation (D&E) when compared with Dilapan-S.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLaminaria contains iodine, and is considered to be a rich source of iron and potassium (19, 9556). Iodine is present in concentrations from 0.03% to 1% in laminaria (18). Other constituents of laminaria include alginates, fucoidan, laminarin, and cellulose (fiber) (6, 94044). Fucoidan refers to various sulfated polysaccharides, consisting primarily of fucose and galactose, found in brown seaweed species (109573). Dietary fiber content in laminaria is approximately 30% (94044, 94047).\nAnticoagulant effects\nLaminarin, a constituent of laminaria, has anticoagulant activity similar to heparin when more extensively sulfated (6).\nAntiviral effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that alginate-containing kelp extracts might have antiviral effects, possibly by inhibiting viral enzyme activity (9554). However, the risk of adverse effects resulting from laminaria's iodine content may outweigh the benefits of its use as a routine preventative measure (515).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe basal portion of the blades of laminaria is used as a hypotensive agent; the constituents histamine and lamine may be responsible for hypotensive effects (6).\nGastrointestinal effects\nLaminaria forms a viscous colloidal solution of gel in water, allowing it to be used as a bulk laxative (6). The constituent algin (sodium alginate) has bulk laxative and demulcent (soothing) effects (272). Some clinical research suggests that laminaria can regulate the composition of gut microbiota (109574).\nGenitourinary effects\nLaminaria forms a viscous colloidal solution of gel in water and has been used to dilate or ripen the cervix. For this use, laminaria \"tents\" are inserted cervically. They absorb ambient moisture, gradually swelling to a diameter of 1/2 inch over 4-6 hours (6). The mechanism of cervical \"ripening\" might be similar to that of a foreign body that disrupts the normal chorioamniotic balance and initiates prostaglandin synthesis. That, in turn, causes myometrial contractions and cervical ripening. An alternative theory is that laminaria causes ripening because it contains high levels of the prostaglandin precursor, arachidonic acid. Still another theory is that laminaria causes partial detachment of the placenta and induces cervical dilation (6). Despite these various proposed mechanisms of action, clinical research has shown little to no benefit with the use of topical laminaria for the induction of labor or second trimester abortion (94045, 95688, 95689, 102765, 105805).\nHypoglycemia effects\nA small clinical study in healthy adults of normal weight shows that consuming laminaria 5 grams with a starchy meal reduces postprandial blood glucose in a weight-adjusted model when compared with a control meal containing pea protein. This suggests a dose-dependent response, with adults below the median weight experiencing a reduced blood glucose response. Similarly, insulin and C-peptide were reduced in the weight-adjusted model. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels were increased, both with and without weight adjustment, when compared with control (105807).\nLipid effects\nLaminarin, a constituent of laminaria, has antilipemic activity when partially sulfated (6). However, research in humans shows that taking laminaria orally does not significantly affect serum lipid profiles in healthy young females (94044). It is unclear if laminaria affects lipid levels in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nRadioactive protective effects\nAlginate-containing kelp reduces absorption of radioactive strontium in animals and humans and it has been used for managing radioactive intoxication (6).\nWeight loss effects\nClinical research suggests that laminaria may increase feelings of fullness due to its fiber content; this might aid in weight loss (94044, 105807). A small clinical study in healthy adults of normal weight shows that consuming laminaria 5 grams with a starchy meal improves satiety and fullness scores when compared with control; however, energy intake at the subsequent ad libitum meal is unchanged. The validity of these findings may be limited by an inability to mask the seaweed taste (105807). Animal research suggests that fucoidan, a constituent of laminaria, may reduce body weight. Fucoidan supplementation ameliorated weight gain and fat accumulation in mice fed a high-fat diet (109573)."

Instead, larch arabinogalactan is fermented by human colonic microflora (31802, 31813, 31818, 31828, 31835, 93103). This fermentation produces the short chain fatty acids acetate, butyrate, and propionate. Some laboratory research suggests that intact larch arabinogalactan may have a direct effect on the immune system by transferring through gut-associated lymphoid tissue (93103).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLarch arabinogalactan is a polysaccharide from the bark of the Larch tree. Arabinogalactans are long, densely branched, high-molecular weight polysaccharides found in many plants. The highest concentrations of arabinogalactans are found in larch trees (15617). The major sugars of arabinogalactan are galactose and arabinose (31819). Larch arabinogalactan contains side chains with single galactose units as well as linked galactose and arabinose (31824). Arabinogalactan from other plant species (31786) and even within the same plant species (31792, 31804) may not be structurally identical.\nDrug delivery\nBecause arabinogalactans are water soluble and contain many hydroxyl groups, they are considered promising for use in drug delivery systems. Some animal research suggests that combining ibuprofen with larch arabinogalactan in a 1:10 complex decreases the effective analgesic and anti-inflammatory dose of ibuprofen by increasing its bioavailability. In theory, this complex should allow ibuprofen to be administered in lower doses, reducing the risk for toxic effects while maintaining its therapeutic effectiveness (93101).\nGastrointestinal effects\nLarch arabinogalactan is a soluble, non-viscous fiber which ferments in the gut (3529, 3530, 15617, 15620, 93103). Doses of 15 grams or 30 grams daily for 6 weeks increases gut Lactobacillus and decreases fecal ammonia. But it doesn't affect short-chain fatty acid production, fecal weight, bowel transit time, or fecal enzyme activity (15620). These effects suggest it might be beneficial as a dietary fiber supplement for some uses (3529, 3530); however, clinical research shows that larch arabinogalactan 8.4 grams daily for 6 months or 15 grams or 30 grams daily for 6 weeks does not significantly reduce cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, blood pressure, or weight in health volunteers (15617, 15620).\nHepatic effects\nLarch arabinogalactan has been shown to concentrate in the liver (15619). Some researchers think it might block hepatic receptors for metastatic cells and decrease liver metastases (3529, 3530). In animal research, pretreatment with arabinogalactan reduced liver metastases and prolonged survival (31799, 31809, 31811, 31812).\nImmunological effects\nLarch arabinogalactan is thought to have immunostimulatory effects by increasing release of interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6, and stimulating phagocytosis and natural killer cell activity. Arabinogalactans are also found in other plants with immunostimulatory activity, including echinacea (3529, 3530, 15618, 93103). In vitro research suggests that pretreatment with arabinogalactan enhances natural killer cytotoxicity against K562 tumor cells. This was suggested to be due to increased release of interferon gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1b, and IL-6 (31827). However, some preliminary clinical research shows that taking larch arabinogalactan 1.5 grams or 4.5 grams daily for 4 weeks does not increase levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, or interferon-gamma when compared with placebo (93105).\n\nSome preliminary clinical research has evaluated whether a specific larch arabinogalactan extract (ResistAid; Lonza Ltd) can enhance the immune response to various vaccinations in healthy adults. One small clinical study shows that taking this extract 4.5 grams daily with breakfast increases the IgG immune response to the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine, but may not affect IgA, white blood cells, complements, or cytokines after 51 or 72 days (17370). Another small study shows that taking this extract 1.5 grams daily with breakfast increases the IgG immune response to the tetanus diphtheria toxoid vaccine after 30 days; however, a higher dose of 4.5 mg daily was not beneficial. This same small study shows that taking this extract 1.5 or 4.5 grams daily with breakfast does not affect the IgG or IgM immune response to the trivalent influenza vaccine after 15 or 30 days (104281).\nOther\nIn animal models, injecting larch arabinogalactan increases vascular permeability. Some evidence suggests that larch arabinogalactan's effect of permeability is due to interactions with antibodies. Repeated injections results in desensitization to larch arabinogalactan (15619).\nRenal effects\nSome preliminary clinical research suggests that dietary fiber, including arabinogalactan, reduces the mean plasma urea in uremic patients (31815). It was suggested that this was due to the inhibition of colonic bacterial production of ammonia."

It is unclear if this effect was due to L-arginine, other ingredients, or other factors.\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, arginine can cause flushing, rash, and hives (3460, 32138, 102587, 104223). The skin reactions were likely of allergic etiology as oral L-arginine has been associated with eosinophilia (32138). In one case report, intravenous administration caused allergic reactions including urticaria, periorbital edema, and pruritus (11830). Excessively rapid infusion of L-arginine has caused flushing, local venous irritation, numbness. Extravasation has caused necrosis and superficial phlebitis (3330, 16817).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, L-arginine has been reported to cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal discomfort, and bloating (1363, 31855, 31871, 31972, 31978, 32261, 90198, 91197, 96811, 99243)(102587, 102592).\n\nOrally, L-arginine has been reported to cause esophagitis in at least six adolescents. Symptoms, which included pain and dysphagia, occurred within 1-3 months of treatment in most cases (102588). There are at least two cases of acute pancreatitis possibly associated with oral L-arginine. In one case, a 28-year-old male developed pancreatitis after consuming a shake containing 1.2 grams of L-arginine daily as arginine alpha-ketoglutarate. The shake also contained plant extracts, caffeine, vitamins, and other amino acids. Although there is a known relationship between L-arginine and pancreatitis in animal models, it is not clear if L-arginine was directly responsible for the occurrence of pancreatitis in this case (99266).\n\nIntravenously, excessively rapid infusion of L-arginine has been reported to cause nausea and vomiting (3330, 16817).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIntravenous L-arginine has been associated with lower back pain and leg restlessness (32273). Orally, L-arginine has been associated with asthenia (32138).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, L-arginine has been associated with headache (31855, 31955, 32261, 91197, 102587, 102592), insomnia, fatigue (102587, 102592), and vertigo (32150, 102592).\nless\nOncologic\nIn breast cancer patients, L-arginine stimulated tumor protein synthesis, which suggests stimulated tumor growth (31917).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nWhen inhaled, L-arginine can cause airway inflammation and exacerbation of airway inflammation in asthma (121). However, two studies assessing oral L-arginine in patients with asthma did not detect any adverse airway effects (31849, 104223).\nless\nRenal\nIntravenously, L-arginine has been associated with natriuresis, kaliuresis, chloruresis, and systemic acidosis (32225). Orally, L-arginine can cause gout (3331, 3595).\nless\nOther\nOrally, L-arginine has been associated with delayed menses, night sweats, and flushing (31855).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAngina. Oral L-arginine seems to improve symptoms and exercise tolerance in patients with angina.\nClinical research shows that taking L-arginine orally seems to decrease symptoms and improve exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with mild to severe angina (3593, 7815, 7816, 31866, 31923). Some patients with severe angina who have frequent attacks at rest despite treatment with standard antianginal agents might also benefit from L-arginine (3593). However, L-arginine does not seem to improve objective measures of blood vessel dilation or increase circulating concentrations of nitric oxide (7817, 99262). Also, when used in combination with ten 200 mcg injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-165 plasmid DNA, L-arginine 6 grams daily orally for 3 months does not improve angina severity in patients with coronary artery disease who underwent surgical angiogenesis compared to patients who did not receive this combination (32001). In addition, intravenous infusion of arginine 10% solution does not improve exercise capacity in patients with stable angina when compared with placebo (31843, 32293).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Oral L-arginine might improve symptoms of ED. When taken with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, L-arginine seems to provide a small additional benefit.\nTaking L-arginine orally in high doses, 5 grams daily, improves subjective assessment of sexual function in males with organic ED when compared with placebo (222, 102586). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 4 small clinical studies in patients with ED, including those with diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease risk factors, shows that although PDE5 inhibitors improve sexual function better than L-arginine, the combination of PDE5 inhibitors and L-arginine may be more effective than either treatment alone (105065). In most clinical trials, doses of L-arginine 2.5-5 mg daily for 6-12 weeks were used alone or in addition to PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil 50 mg or tadalafil 5-10 mg daily (102586, 102587, 102592, 104222). Higher doses have also been investigated. One clinical trial shows that taking L-arginine (Bioarginina, Farmaceutici Damor S.p.A., Napoli, Italy), 2 grams three times daily for 3 months improves sexual function compared with placebo (110387). However, taking lower doses, 1.5 grams daily, might not be effective in patients with mixed-type ED (2038).\n\nL-arginine has also been examined in combination with other ingredients. A meta-analysis of 2 small clinical studies in males with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking L- arginine, up to 3 grams daily, in combination with maritime pine for 1-6 months improves a subjective assessment of sexual function when compared with control (112715). Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that taking L-arginine orally in low doses, 1.7 grams daily in combination with maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) or taking 0.69 grams daily along with maritime pine bark extract and aspartic acid (Edicare, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) modestly improves symptoms of ED (10416, 50924). Another preliminary clinical trial has investigated the effects of a combination of L-arginine 2.5 grams daily for 6 months and tadalafil 5 mg daily for 3 months, both starting with the initiation of weekly extracorporeal shock wave (ESW) therapy. When compared with ESW alone, this combination modestly improves sexual function for up to 12 months (110388). The effect of L-arginine alone is not clear from these studies.\nless\nHypertension. Oral L-arginine can modestly reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\nOral L-arginine seems to have additive vasodilating effects when used with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or nitrate vasodilators such as isosorbide mononitrate (7822, 20192, 31916). A meta-analysis of clinical research in a variety of populations shows that taking L-arginine reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP; DPB) by an average of 6.40 mmHg and 2.64 mmHg, respectively. Sub-analyses show that these reductions occur in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Beneficial effects were limited to adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 19.9 kg/m2 (110384). The effect of L-arginine on blood pressure levels in adults exposed to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) has also been investigated. Clinical research in adults with hypertension shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams three times daily for 2 weeks modestly reduces SBP and DBP elevations following a 2-hour exposure to TRAP during an outdoor walk compared with taking placebo (110383). Doses have included 4-24 grams daily, with the best evidence of benefit for doses of less than 9 grams daily, for 2-24 weeks (7818, 10636, 31871, 31923, 32167, 32201, 110383, 110384).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Oral L-arginine may help prevent NEC in premature infants.\nIn a meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials, L-arginine 260 mg/kg orally in a single dose or two divided doses daily reduces the absolute risk of NEC in premature infants by about 62% when compared with placebo. To prevent one case of NEC, 6 infants would need to be treated with L-arginine (8474, 91194, 96803).\nless\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). Short-term use of intravenous or oral L-arginine may improve symptoms of PAD, but long-term use does not seem to be beneficial.\nClinical research shows that using L-arginine intravenously or orally for up to 8 weeks increases flow-mediated dilation and improves symptoms of intermittent claudication associated with PAD (3465, 31857, 31905). However, long-term administration of L-arginine orally for up to 6 months does not improve walking speed, walking distance, or absolute claudication distance in patients with PAD and intermittent claudication (31957, 31985).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. Intravenous L-arginine may have beneficial effects in pre-eclampsia. However, it is unclear if oral L-arginine is effective.\nOne small clinical study shows that intravenous L-arginine 30 grams as a one-time dose decreases systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 11 mmHg when compared to baseline in pregnant patients with hypertension or pre-eclampsia (31847), while intravenous L-arginine 20 grams daily for 5 days decreases SBP and DBP by about 2% when compared with placebo (31978). Another small clinical study shows that oral use of L-arginine 3 grams daily for 3 weeks reduces SBP and DBP by around 7 and 5 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo (31938); however, taking L-arginine 12 grams daily by mouth for 5 days does not seem to improve blood pressure in these patients (11828). Another preliminary clinical trial allowing for both oral and intravenous dosing shows that taking L-arginine 3.5 grams by mouth every 6 hours or 10 grams via intravenous infusion every 8 hours shortly before or immediately after delivery and continuing until postpartum day 3 does not improve blood pressure when compared with placebo (31959). The reasons for the disparate findings are unclear, but the small study sizes, as well as variations in the dose, duration, and timing of therapy before and/or after delivery, may explain some of the differences.\n\nOral L-arginine has also been evaluated for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. One clinical study in patients at high risk for pre-eclampsia shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily starting the 20th week of gestation reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia by about 74% when compared with placebo (96811). Based on these results, one case of pre-eclampsia is prevented for every 6 high-risk pregnant patients treated with L-arginine 3 grams daily. Another clinical study also shows that taking two bars of a specific medical food (Heart Bars, Nellson Nutraceutical) containing L-arginine 6.6 grams and antioxidant vitamins daily starting at 14-32 weeks gestation and continuing until delivery reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia by 44% when compared with a bar containing antioxidant vitamins alone in patients at high risk of pre-eclampsia (91197). Based on these results, one case of pre-eclampsia is prevented for every 11 high risk patients treated with this L-arginine-containing medical food.\nless\nPregnancy-induced hypertension. Intravenous L-arginine may have beneficial effects in pregnancy-induced hypertension.\nSome clinical research in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension shows that intravenous infusion of L-arginine 20 grams daily for up to 5 days decreases systolic blood pressure by 2% to 3% and diastolic blood pressure by about 3% when compared with placebo (31933, 31961, 31978). Clinical research in patients with pre-existing hypertension has also been conducted. One clinical trial shows that taking L-arginine 4 grams by mouth daily for 10-12 weeks does not seem to reduce blood pressure in those with pre-existing hypertension or mild gestational hypertension. However, these results are confounded by the fact that more patients taking placebo needed to be placed on antihypertensive therapy during the study. L-arginine reduced the risk of being placed on antihypertensive drug therapy during the pregnancy by 47% when compared with placebo (32191). Based on this study, for every 5 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension treated with L-arginine over placebo, antihypertensive drug therapy is avoided in one additional patient. L-arginine has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients in patients with pre-existing hypertension. Preliminary clinical research in patients with pre-existing hypertension and a previous history of pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or other placenta vascular disorder shows that taking L-arginine and other ingredients starting at 14 weeks gestation prevents an increase in blood pressure and reduces the percentage of patients requiring new antihypertensive medication by about 73% compared with 24.5% of those not taking this combination. In this study, L-arginine 3 grams daily was taken with magnesium 350 mg and salicylate 100 mg. Therefore, the effect of L-arginine alone is unclear. All patients in the study were taking low dose aspirin 100 mg daily (110382).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). Oral or intravenous L-arginine does not seem to improve CKD.\nMost preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine, either orally for up to 6 months or intravenously short-term, does not improve kidney function, glomerular filtration rate, or renal plasma flow in patients with CKD, although proteinuria may be reduced in some patients (31844, 31904, 32235, 32303).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Oral L-arginine does not seem to reduce cholesterol levels.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking L-arginine 21 grams daily for 4 weeks does not reduce plasma lipids (1363). Furthermore, meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking L-arginine for up to about 6 months does not reduce total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in populations of healthy individuals or those with cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, there was a very small effect on fasting triglyceride levels (102590, 102591).\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). Oral L-arginine does not seem to improve outcomes after MI.\nPatients who have had an ST-segment MI who take L-arginine within 24 hours to 21 days, titrated up to a dose of 3 grams three times a day for up to 6 months, do not seem to have reduced vascular stiffness or increased ejection fraction (13221, 32137). Also, there is some concern that long-term use of L-arginine might actually worsen outcomes and increase mortality in these patients (13221). Population studies also suggest that intake of L-arginine does not reduce the risk of experiencing an acute coronary event such as MI or coronary heart disease-related mortality (3332, 6896, 7821, 10637).\nless\nTuberculosis. Oral L-arginine does not seem to improve symptoms or the clearance of tuberculosis infection.\nClinical research shows that taking L-arginine (ArgimaxH) 6 grams daily orally for 8 weeks, with or without vitamin D, does not improve symptoms of tuberculosis or the clearance of tuberculosis infection when used with standard treatment (91196).\nless\nWound healing. Oral L-arginine does not seem to improve wound healing.\nClinical research shows that taking L-arginine (as arginine aspartate) 17 grams orally in three divided doses daily for 2 weeks does not improve epithelialization in healthy, elderly patients with catheter wounds, although it may improve collagen deposition (32247). Also, taking L-arginine (as L-arginine hydrochloride) 26 grams daily for 5 days perioperatively does not improve angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, or neutrophil count in patients undergoing skin graft donation when compared with placebo (20692). In addition, taking a wound-specific oral nutrition supplement containing L-arginine 4.5 grams, zinc, and vitamin C twice daily for 4 weeks, along with standard wound care for 8 weeks, is no more effective for wound healing than a standard oral nutrition supplement along with standard wound care (90198).\n\nL-arginine has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Taking L-arginine enterally or orally, before or after surgery, in combination with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and either eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or fish oil, seems to improve wound healing when compared with a control group (5531, 32174). Another observational study conducted in Italy in newborns shows that applying a specific topical powder containing L-arginine, arnica extract, zinc oxide, and other ingredients (Cicaben, Orsana Italia S.r.l.) to the newborn's umbilical cord stump 3 to 4 times daily until stump detachment reduces the rates of mild complications 48 hours after discharge such as a wet cord stump but does not change the time to cord stump detachment or the rates of purulent secretions or umbilical granulomas when compared with standard dry care. However, no differences were noted between the groups one week after discharge (113662). The validity of these results is limited by the observational nature of the study and the ability of the parents to select a treatment group. It is unclear if the effects in these studies are due to L-arginine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may prevent ARDS.\nA meta-analysis of three small studies shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily, starting in the second or third trimester usually until delivery, reduces the risk of ARDS in the infant by about 54% when compared to control, including placebo or no treatment (110379).\nless\nAltitude sickness. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with altitude sickness.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 4 grams orally three times daily for 2 days while ascending to a high altitude and for 24 hours while at high altitude does not reduce altitude sickness when compared with placebo (31955).\nless\nAnemia of chronic disease. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease.\nOne very small clinical study in elderly adults with chronic kidney disease and anemia shows that taking L-arginine orally 1.3 grams daily might increase hemoglobin and erythropoietin levels in some patients when compared to baseline (31988). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for anthracycline cardiotoxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this purpose.\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with asthma.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with severe asthma shows that taking L-arginine 0.05 gram/kg ideal body weight twice daily does not reduce asthma exacerbations when compared with placebo (104223). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in exacerbation rates between groups. While other studies have shown adverse airway effects in patients with asthma (121, 31849), this study demonstrated no change in exacerbations and reported no adverse airway effects.\nless\nAthletic performance. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may improve measures of athletic performance.\nA meta-analysis of 5 small clinical trials shows that taking L-arginine seems to modestly improve measures of cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by a 0.07 L/minute increase in maximal oxygen uptake, when compared with control (105064).\n\nL-arginine has also been examined for its effects on athletic performance. Most research suggests that taking L-arginine does not improve athletic performance. However, clinical trials are small and may not be adequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes Taking L-arginine as a single dose of 5 or 6 grams or as 5-10 grams daily for 2-4 weeks does not improve grip strength, strength during resistance exercise, power output during cycling, or muscle function during recovery from intense resistance exercise in healthy adults (91190, 97393, 99265, 110381, 110389). Also, taking L-arginine 5 grams daily for 4 weeks (Bioarginina Farmaceutici Damor) or 8 grams daily for 8 days does not increase swim speed (110381, 110386). In contrast, some research suggests that drinking a single beverage containing the same dose of L-arginine 6 grams increases the time to exhaustion during high-intensity exercise when compared with placebo (32180). Also, a meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that supplementation with L-arginine has a large beneficial effect on aerobic performance and a small beneficial effect on anaerobic performance. However, publication bias was evident in the aerobic performance data, limiting these conclusions. Doses found to be beneficial in this analysis included an acute dose of L-arginine 0.15 gram/kg 60-90 minutes before performance or chronic dosing of 1.5 grams to 2 grams daily for 4-7 weeks for aerobic performance. The chronic dose of L-arginine most likely to be beneficial for anaerobic performance is unclear from this analysis due to inclusion of studies using arginine alpha-ketoglutarate (110395). With the exception of a few studies which include a very small number of healthy females (99265, 110395, 110386), research on the use of L-arginine for athletic performance has focused almost exclusively on healthy males. Also, studies are heterogeneous with respect to sport and endpoints. Therefore, whether results can be applied to females or specific athletes is unclear.\n\nL-arginine has also been evaluated in overweight males. One small clinical study shows that taking a single dose of L-arginine 6 grams 90 minutes prior to high-intensity interval training seems to improve exercise tolerance by improving ventilation, heart rate, and oxygen uptake when compared with placebo (105060).\n\nL-arginine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Research in male soccer players shows that taking L-arginine 1.2 grams and L-citrulline 1.2 grams daily for 7 days increases total power output over a 10-minute cycling test and improves subjective perceptions of exertion when compared with placebo (100956). Another study shows that taking L-arginine 1.5 or 3 grams daily, in combination with grape seed extract, increases physical working capacity at fatigue threshold when compared with pretreatment in untrained, college-aged males (32164). Additionally, a study in trained athletes shows that taking L-arginine 6 grams, in combination with nitrate obtained from fresh spinach, 3 hours prior to exercise improves peak power, average power, and agility when compared with placebo (116207). It is unclear if these benefits are due to L-arginine, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in children with beta-thalassemia.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 6-18 years treated conventionally for pulmonary hypertension related to beta-thalassemia shows that taking L-arginine 0.1 mg/kg daily for 60 days reduces Doppler echocardiography pulmonary arterial pressure by 35% compared with baseline. This measurement was increased by up to 15% in children given conventional treatments only; however, a statistical comparison between these treatment groups was lacking (110391).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with breast cancer.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 30 grams daily for 3 days prior to chemotherapy does not improve the clinical response rate in breast cancer patients when compared with placebo (32282).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with cognitive impairment.\nA small clinical trial in frail adults aged 65 years of age and up with hypertension shows that taking L-arginine (Bioarginina) 1.66 grams twice daily for 4 weeks modestly improves cognitive function when compared to placebo (110385).\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with CHF.\nOne small clinical study in patients with CHF stage 2-3 shows that taking L-arginine 15 grams daily for 5 days, in combination with conventional treatment, seems to improve glomerular filtration rate (GFR), creatinine clearance, and sodium and water elimination after saline loading, indicating an improvement in kidney function (3596).\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for preventing complications after CABG surgery.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that venous infusion of L-arginine hydrochloride 30 grams as a 10% solution over 15 minutes helps maintain mean arterial pressure, coronary vascular resistance, and graft blood flow when compared with a placebo infusion in patients that have undergone CABG (31840). Administering L-arginine 7.5 grams in 500 mL of cardioplegic solution also seems to reduce wedge pressure and intensive care unit stay in patients undergoing CABG; however, it does not reduce hospital stay duration or postoperative complications when compared with cardioplegic solution alone (31958, 31886).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.\nA small clinical trial in patients with severe COVID-19 shows that receiving oral L-arginine (Argin, Nutrigrow, India) 3 grams daily for a maximum of 10 days while on oxygen support does not affect the percentage of patients weaned off oxygen support after 10 days, the length of time requiring oxygen support, the duration of hospitalization, or the incidence of adverse thrombotic events, compared with placebo (110392). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect differences between groups. An interim analysis of a small clinical trial in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 shows that adding oral L-arginine (Bioarginina, Farmaceutici Damor) 1.66 grams twice daily to standard therapy throughout hospitalization increases the rate of respiratory support reduction by 60% after 10 days of therapy, but not after 20 days of therapy, when compared with placebo. L-arginine also significantly reduced the length of hospital stay. The median hospital stay was 25 days and 46 days, respectively, for L-arginine and placebo (106500).\n\nL-arginine has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients for post-acute COVID symptoms. Preliminary clinical research in adults with persistent fatigue following a COVID infection shows that taking L-arginine 1.66 grams plus vitamin C 500 mg (Bioarginina C, Farmaceutici Damor) twice daily for 28 days increases the distance walked in 6 minutes by 30 meters and reduces the percentage of patients with fatigue by about 89%, when compared with placebo. Grip strength was also increased (110390).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone are unclear.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking L-arginine orally with glutamine, nucleotides, and omega-3 fatty acids reduces the recovery time, the need for ventilation, and infection rates in critically ill patients, but does not reduce the risk of mortality (31853).\nless\nCyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this purpose.\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with cystic fibrosis.\nPreliminary clinical research in teens and adults with cystic fibrosis shows that twice daily inhalation with L-arginine 500 mg for 2 weeks does not improve lung function when compared with inhaling 2.6% hypertonic saline twice daily (96807).\nless\nDental caries. Small clinical studies suggest that using a dentifrice containing L-arginine might prevent dental caries.\nA meta-analysis of small studies shows that use of a dentifrice containing L-arginine 1.5% w/w in combination with calcium base (Dical or calcium carbonate) and fluoride 1450 ppm 2-3 times daily for up to 2 years reduces the risk of developing dental caries by a small to moderate amount when compared with a dentifrice containing only fluoride in children and adults (96806). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that using a confection containing an L-arginine complex (CaviStat) for one year reduces the number of dental caries in molars of children when compared with a sugarless mint control (32011).\n\nL-arginine has also been investigated as a prebiotic in combination with probiotics. In 5- to 9-year-old children with low caries risk, clinical research shows that taking one lozenge daily for 10-12 months containing arginine 20 mg along with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, modestly reduces caries severity, but does not reduce caries progression, active caries lesions, plaque, or gingivitis, when compared with placebo (113241, 113242).\nless\nDental hypersensitivity. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using a toothpaste containing L-arginine, calcium, and fluoride twice daily reduces dentin hypersensitivity when compared with pretreatment or control (32130, 32131, 32132, 32177). However, a small clinical study in adults shows that applying a paste containing L-arginine 8%, calcium carbonate, and potassium nitrate twice for 30 minutes does not reduce sensitivity when compared with control (117116). Another clinical study in adults shows that applying a topical combination of L-arginine 10% and ibuprofen to tooth enamel surfaces for 10 minutes prior to in-office tooth bleaching reduces the risk and intensity of tooth sensitivity when compared with placebo (115354). It is unclear whether the effects are due to L-arginine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in adults with depression.\nA small, single-center clinical study in Iran in adult females with major depressive disorder taking an antidepressant shows that adding L-arginine (Made, Jalinous Pharmaceutical Company) 2 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve symptoms of depression when compared with placebo (116205).\nless\nDiabetes. Small, low-quality studies suggest that oral L-arginine does not improve glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of small, low-quality studies shows that taking L-arginine 2-20 grams daily for up to 77 weeks decreases fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels in adults without diabetes. However, no improvements occurred in adults WITH type 2 diabetes. This may be explained by previous studies which suggest L-arginine affects glucose control only in the early steps of beta-cell dysfunction. L-arginine did not improve insulin resistance or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with or without diabetes (104225). Also, a prospective observational study in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes has found that taking a specific product (Flebotrofine, AMNOL Chimica Biologica) containing L-arginine for 3 months is not associated with improvements in HbA1c, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with baseline. Other ingredients in this product included diosmin, troxerutin, hesperidin, black currant extract, and gotu kola extract (108151). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if oral or subcutaneous L-arginine is beneficial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.\nA very small clinical study shows that administering L-arginine subcutaneously at the site of diabetic foot ulcers does not decrease healing time or rate of amputation when combined with conventional therapies (14914). Also, taking a specific drink containing L-arginine 7 grams, L-glutamine 7 grams, and calcium hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.5 grams (Juven/Abound, Abbott Nutrition) orally twice daily for 16 weeks does not improve diabetic foot ulcer healing when compared with a control drink in non-ischemic patients or those with normal albumin levels. However, in specific populations with low albumin and/or poor limb perfusion, up to 74% more patients had total wound healing when compared with the control drink (96637).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with diabetic neuropathy.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily for 3 months does not improve circulation, disability, or nerve function in patients with diabetic neuropathy when compared with placebo (32145).\nless\nHead and neck cancer. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with head and neck cancer.\nSmall clinical studies suggest that enteral nutrition supplemented with L-arginine does not seem to have any beneficial effects on markers of immune function such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), length of postoperative hospital stay, or fistula rates; however, it seems to reduce wounds and general infections after surgery in patients with head and neck cancer when compared with control (10160, 32008).\nless\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with heart failure.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with heart failure shows that taking L-arginine 3.0-12.6 grams orally daily for 6-12 weeks does not consistently improve exercise tolerance or peripheral vascular resistance (3595, 6028, 32138). However, some research shows that taking L-arginine 1000 mg three times daily for 10 weeks modestly improves measures of cardiac function compared with placebo (110380). Although some research disagrees (32138), most research shows that taking L-arginine modestly improves quality of life (3595, 110380).\nless\nHeart transplant complications. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients that have received a heart transplant.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 6 grams orally twice daily for 6 weeks increases walking distance and oxygen uptake and delays the ventilatory threshold in heart transplant patients when compared with baseline (32150).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related wasting. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical study in patients with HIV/AIDS shows that taking L-arginine orally, in combination with hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) and glutamine for 8 weeks, increases body weight, particularly lean body mass, and positively affects immune status when compared with placebo (1909). However, other clinical research in HIV-positive patients shows that taking L-arginine 7.4 grams daily orally, in combination with omega-3 fatty acids and a balanced oral nutritional supplement for 6 months, does not improve body weight or fat mass, total energy intake, or immune status when compared to taking the nutritional supplement alone (113).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral L-arginine can prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in adults with prediabetes.\nClinical research shows that taking L-arginine (Bioarginine, Farmaceutici Damor) 3.2 grams orally twice daily for 18 months does not reduce the incidence of diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). However, when assessed one year after treatment discontinuation, patients who took L-arginine had a 58% lower risk of developing diabetes when compared with placebo (91195).\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral L-arginine improves outcomes in people undergoing an assisted reproductive technology (ART) program.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 16 grams daily decreases the cancellation rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and increases the number of oocytes collected in females undergoing an ART program when compared with control. However, taking L-arginine does not seem to improve the number of viable pregnancies (31842). A small clinical study of females undergoing an ART program shows that taking a combination product containing L-arginine 1 gram with folate 200 mcg or L-arginine 2 grams, folate 400 mcg, and vitamin E 10 mg daily for 12 weeks does not affect the hCG-positive rate or clinical pregnancy rate when compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis suggests that taking these combination products might improve HCG-positive and clinical pregnancy rates in females who are undergoing ART due to male infertility (104224). However, this small study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes, limiting the validity of these findings.\nless\nInterstitial cystitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may improve pain in interstitial cystitis.\nTaking L-arginine orally seems to reduce some symptoms, especially pain, that are associated with interstitial cystitis (107, 114, 3460, 31855, 32267). Research shows that patients with interstitial cystitis having a bladder capacity greater than 800 mL and/or a history of recurrent genitourinary infections might respond more favorably to L-arginine than patients with bladder capacity less than 800 mL and/or no history of recurrent genitourinary infections. Three months of treatment may be necessary before significant symptom improvement occurs (3460). However, L-arginine does not seem to reduce the need to urinate at night or improve urgency or frequency of urination (3460, 31855).\nless\nIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Small clinical studies suggest that oral or intravenous L-arginine may increase birthweight in IUGR.\nA meta-analysis of mainly small studies shows that L-arginine given orally or intravenously in the third trimester for a time period of 7 days or until delivery increases the birthweight by up to 650 grams in patients with an IUGR pregnancy. Furthermore, there is evidence from a small number of these studies that L-arginine supplementation decreases the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and fetal intracranial hemorrhage (96804). A more recent meta-analysis of small studies also shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily, starting in the second or third trimester usually until delivery, reduces the risk of an IUGR infant by about 32% when compared to control, including placebo or no treatment (110379). Doses used in clinical research have usually been 3 grams daily orally, although some studies have used up to 20 grams intravenously (31930, 31937, 96804, 110379). However, supplementation with L-arginine does not seem to increase birthweight or reduce neonatal mortality or morbidity when compared with placebo in patients with severe IUGR (32083).\nless\nKidney transplant. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may not improve kidney function in patients after kidney transplantation.\nAlthough preliminary clinical research showed some benefit, evidence from other clinical research shows that infusion with L-arginine does not increase renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate in kidney transplant patients treated with cyclosporine, including those experiencing transplant dysfunction (112, 31876, 32229). Other evidence suggests that intravenous L-arginine improves kidney function only in transplant patients receiving organs with a short cold ischemia time or those receiving kidneys from young donors (31887).\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in males with infertility.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 4 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve semen quality in males with oligospermia when compared with placebo (32209). However, one small clinical study shows that a specific formulation of L-arginine aspartate and maritime pine bark extract (Prelox), taken for 6 months, improves sperm quality in males with idiopathic male infertility when compared to baseline (32061). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if this effect is due to L-arginine, maritime pine bark, or the combination.\nless\nMigraine headache. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for migraine, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this condition.\nMitochondrial myopathies. Small clinical studies suggest that intravenous L-arginine may modestly improve symptoms in patients with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome).\nPreliminary clinical research shows that infusions of L-arginine, 0.5 grams/kg administered within one hour of stroke-like symptoms, improves headaches, nausea, vomiting, transient blindness, and the appearance of bright spots when compared to pretreatment in patients with MELAS (31943, 99263). Also, taking oral L-arginine 4-24 grams daily for 18 months seems to reduce the frequency and severity of stroke-like symptoms associated with MELAS when compared to baseline (31943). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking oral L-arginine 0.3-0.5 grams/kg daily in three divided doses for 2 years does not reduce the severity of MELAS symptoms, including migraine and stroke-like episodes. If a stroke-like episode did occur, administration of intravenous L-arginine 0.5 grams/kg improved headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbance (99263). The validity of this research is limited by the small study sizes and the absence of comparator groups.\nless\nMuscular dystrophy. There is limited evidence on the oral use of L-arginine in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nA very small study in five children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, shows that drinking a beverage containing L-arginine hydrochloride (L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Selectchemie) 2.5 grams three times daily, in addition to metformin 250 mg twice daily, for 16 weeks improves motor function by 4% and increases distance walked in two minutes by 9.6 meters when compared to baseline (96805). The validity of these findings is limited by the very small study size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nNitrate tolerance. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for nitrate tolerance.\nA very small crossover study in adults with stable angina shows that taking L-arginine orally 700 mg four times daily for up to 10 days seems to prevent tolerance to transdermal nitrate when compared with placebo (8475).\nless\nObesity. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may be beneficial for weight loss.\nA meta-analysis of mainly small clinical trials shows that taking L-arginine daily for at least 8 weeks modestly reduces body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference when compared with placebo. However, when taking L-arginine for less than 8 weeks, BMI and body weight were not affected. The optimal dose of L-arginine was 2-6 grams (110398). An additional small clinical study suggests that taking a specific arginine supplement (NOW Foods) 3 grams by mouth three times daily for 12 weeks, in addition to receiving dietary counseling, reduces waist circumference by 4-6 cm and reduces body weight by 1.8-2.9 kg when compared to baseline in obese females 18-40 years of age (91193). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nOral mucositis. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a specific combination of L-arginine 7 grams, L-glutamine 7 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.2 grams (Abound; Abbott) in water twice daily during chemoradiotherapy treatment for head and neck cancer does not reduce the incidence of severe oral mucositis when compared with a historical control (99243). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo control. Additionally, a small open-label study in patients undergoing chemoradiation for head and neck cancer shows that taking a specific combination product (Abound, Abbot) containing L-arginine, glutamine, and HMB twice daily throughout chemoradiation treatments decreases the incidence of grade 3 or higher oral mucositis and ameliorates body weight loss when compared with no intervention (113726). However, the incidence of grade 2 or higher oral mucositis was not reduced. It is unclear if this effect is due to L-arginine, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of the study is limited by the lack of blinding.\nless\nPain (acute). Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA single-center clinical study in adults in Brazil undergoing dental surgery shows that taking L-arginine 555 mg with ibuprofen 30 minutes prior to receiving an alveolar nerve block increases the number of nerve blocks associated with no pain or only mild pain when compared with placebo, but not when compared with ibuprofen (117115).\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with periodontitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that using L-arginine aspartate (Yuria-Pharm, Ukraine) 1 gram three times daily orally for 10 days after scaling and root planing, modestly reduces bleeding on probing but not periodontal pocket depth, when compared with untreated controls (108926).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for improving physical performance in older adults.\nA small study in physically active females 65 years of age and older shows that taking L-arginine 8 grams as a single dose does not improve lower body strength, measured by knee flexion and extension tests, or functional performance, measured by sit-stand, tandem gait, and timed up-and-go tests, when compared with placebo (96812).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of N-acetylcysteine 1200 mg daily plus L-arginine 1600 mg daily for 6 months modestly improves menstrual function and decreases insulin resistance in patients with PCOS when compared to baseline (32094). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPostoperative infection. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSmall clinical studies show that taking L-arginine, enterally or orally, either before or after surgery, in combination with fish oil, or with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), seems to reduce the rate of perioperative infection when compared with a control group. The risk of infection was 41% lower when compared to taking no arginine-based formulations. However, there is no good evidence to support the use of L-arginine alone for this purpose, and it is possible that this effect is due to the other ingredients or the combination of ingredients (5531, 32174, 32196).\nless\nPostoperative pain. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small, single-center clinical study in adults in Brazil undergoing dental surgery shows that taking L-arginine 370 mg in combination with ibuprofen prior to surgery, with or without dexamethasone, reduces the total amount of postoperative medication needed when compared with placebo. Although taking L-arginine with ibuprofen and dexamethasone reduced patient-reported pain overall, there was no difference at individual time points (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8 hours) (116208). It is unclear if these effects are due to L-arginine, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSmall clinical studies show that taking L-arginine, enterally or orally, either before or after surgery, in combination with fish oil, or with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), seems to reduce the recovery time after surgery or serious illness when compared with a control group. This seems to be related to a reduced number of perioperative infections and improved wound healing. However, there is no good evidence to support the use of L-arginine alone for this purpose, and it is possible that this effect is due to the other ingredients or the combination of ingredients (5531, 32174, 32196). Additionally, 2 small single-center clinical studies in Japan and Iran in adults show that taking a combination of L-arginine 7-14 grams, glutamine 7-14 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate 1.5-3 grams (Heallagen or Abound) daily for 2-4 weeks before heart surgery reduces hospital stay by 1-4 days and intensive care unit stay by 1 day when compared with control (110394, 116206). Additionally, walking distance was improved after surgery (116206). Furthermore, recovery, based on some biochemical and other measurements, was improved, but there was no difference in overall postoperative complications (110394). However, in another clinical study, taking a combination product (Abound, Abbott) containing L-arginine 7 grams, glutamine 7 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate 1.2 grams orally daily for 3 days before and 7 days after abdominal surgery did not reduce the incidence of wound infection or other complications when compared with placebo (99413). The discrepancies between these studies may be related to differences in the dose or duration of the combination product, the outcomes measured, and/or the type of surgery.\nless\nPressure ulcers. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOral L-arginine has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of grade II-IV pressure ulcers. Two small clinical studies in hospitalized patients show that administering an oral nutritional supplement enriched with L-arginine, zinc, and vitamin C improves ulcer healing when compared with a standard diet (31953, 87173).\n\nA small, retrospective study in sedentary older adults in care facilities shows that taking a specific nutritional supplement (Abound, Abbott) containing L-arginine 7.4 grams, L-glutamine 7.4 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.3 grams twice daily until the complete healing of the pressure ulcer reduces time to complete healing to 170 days on average, compared with 218 days on average in the control group (110396). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients living in long-term care facilities with grade II-IV pressure ulcers shows that taking an oral nutritional supplement enriched in protein, energy, L-arginine, vitamin C, and zinc daily for 9 weeks reduces ulcer area and decreases oozing when compared to baseline (32045). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPreterm labor. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may prevent preterm labor.\nA meta-analysis of three small studies shows that taking L-arginine 3-6.6 grams daily, starting in the second or third trimester usually until delivery, reduces the risk of preterm labor by about 50% when compared to control, usually placebo (110379).\nless\nPulmonary hypertension. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in children with pulmonary hypertension related to beta-thalassemia.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 6-18 years treated conventionally for pulmonary hypertension related to beta-thalassemia shows that taking L-arginine 0.1 mg/kg daily for 60 days reduces Doppler echocardiography pulmonary arterial pressure by 35% compared with baseline. This measurement was increased by up to 15% in children given conventional treatments only; however, a statistical comparison between these treatment groups was lacking (110391).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer shows that taking a combination of L-arginine 7 grams, L-glutamine 7 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.2 grams (Abound, Abbott) in water twice daily from the first day of radiation to approximately 1 week after completion does not reduce the number of patients with severe dermatitis when compared with taking no supplement. However, there was a 34% reduction in the incidence of moderate dermatitis and the overall duration of dermatitis was reduced (96639).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for respiratory tract infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for these conditions.\nRestenosis. It is unclear if intravenous L-arginine helps to prevent restenosis after stent implantation.\nSome clinical research suggests that intravenous and intracoronary infusion of L-arginine during stent implantation followed by oral L-arginine for 2 weeks does not reduce the risk of restenosis when compared with placebo (31925). However, local delivery of 6 mL of L-arginine 100 mg/mL for 15 minutes after stent deployment seems to reduce neointimal formation at 6 months after stent placement when compared with placebo (31883).\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia.\nA small clinical study shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams twice daily for 3 weeks, in conjunction with an individualized medication regimen, does not improve positive, negative, or depressive symptoms associated with schizophrenia when compared with taking the medication regimen alone (99264).\nless\nSexual dysfunction. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for sexual dysfunction in females.\nA small, single-center clinical study in Iran in adult females with major depressive disorder and taking an antidepressant shows that taking L-arginine (Made, Jalinous Pharmaceutical Company) 2 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve patient-reported symptoms of sexual dysfunction (e.g., arousal, desire, lubrication) when compared with placebo (116205).\n\nHowever, results from combination therapy differ. Clinical research in females with sexual dysfunction who are taking oral contraceptives shows that taking a specific combination product (Lady Prelox, Horphag Research) containing L-arginine, maritime pine bark extract, L-citrulline, and rose hip extract daily for 8 weeks improves symptoms of sexual dysfunction by 18% when compared with a control group (91963). Taking the same product in a dose of 2 tablets twice daily for 8 weeks, in addition to the lifestyle management program, improves vaginal dryness in pre- and post-menopausal patients when compared with lifestyle management alone (103611). It is unclear if this effect is due to L-arginine, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nSickle cell disease. Small clinical studies suggest that oral or intravenous L-arginine may modestly improve complications in patients with sickle cell disease.\nTwo small clinical studies in hospitalized children aged 3-19 years with sickle cell disease-related veno-occlusive crisis shows that administering L-arginine intravenously or orally 100 mg/kg three times daily for 5 days or until discharge reduces total opioid use by 26% to 54%, pain scores at discharge by 23%, and median length of hospital stay by about 36 hours when compared with placebo (97392, 105063). Another very small clinical study in patients aged 13-63 years with sickle cell disease shows that taking L-arginine 0.1 grams/kg orally three times daily for 5 days reduces pulmonary hypertension when compared to baseline (11428).\nless\nStress. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that taking a single dose of L-arginine 50 mg plus L-theanine 200 mg modestly reduces stress associated with a stress-loading test when compared with placebo, but was no more effective than taking L-theanine alone (110393).\nless\nValproic acid-induced toxicities. Although there is interest in using intravenous L-arginine for valproic acid toxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate L-arginine for these uses.",

Arginine has caused hyperkalemia, occasionally with fatal cardiac arrhythmia, in patients with kidney insufficiency or failure (32213, 32218).\nless\nMYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI)\nThere is concern that L-arginine might worsen outcomes in patients following an MI. In a study of patients who had an ST-segment MI within 3-21 days, taking L-arginine supplements up to 3 grams daily for 6 months seemed to increase the risk of mortality. Death occurred in 8.6% of patients taking L-arginine, compared to 0% in the placebo group. Most of the deaths were in patients over 60 years of age. Researchers theorize that L-arginine might worsen outcomes in some patients by increasing reactive oxygen species and homocysteine. L-arginine might also increase the activity of an isoform of nitric oxide synthetase that is induced by atherosclerotic disease (13221). Advise patients who have had a recent MI to avoid taking L-arginine supplements.\nless\nPERIOPERATIVE\nTheoretically, L-arginine might interfere with blood pressure control during and after surgical procedures due to its ability to lower blood pressure (7822, 10636).

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "Presentation\nAdministration of high doses of L-arginine in children has caused hypersensitivity reactions, hematuria, and death. Symptoms of overdose may include vomiting, respiratory distress, and metabolic acidosis (16817).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with L-arginine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nBioavailability: L-arginine has an oral bioavailability of 68% (108). In another study, a 10 gram oral dose of L-arginine had a 20% bioavailability (31838). The arginase 1 (ARG1) and arginase 2 (ARG2) genes may alter the bioavailability of L-arginine in humans. Observational research in adults who took an average of 10.8 grams of L-arginine daily found that a higher prevalence of the minor allele of ARG1 rs2246012 was associated with higher blood L-arginine concentrations. Genetic variation in ARG1 may impact L-arginine absorption (105061).\nMetabolism\nThe degradation of arginine produces nitric oxide, polyamines, proline, glutamate, creatine, and agmatine (32048). More specifically, arginase hydrolyzes arginine into urea and ornithine. L-arginine is broken down into nitric oxide and L-citrulline. L-citrulline can be converted again into arginine (32048, 110389).\nExcretion\nL-arginine has an elimination half-life of approximately 80 minutes. Renal clearance appears to be more prominent after intravenous dosing of arginine (108, 31838).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nL-arginine is an amino acid necessary for protein synthesis. It is found naturally in foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products (3330). L-arginine is best known for its effects on the vascular system. L-arginine is a substrate for the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme. In human research, taking L-arginine has been shown to increase blood levels of nitric oxide (NO) (110391). In vascular endothelial cells, NOS converts L-arginine to NO, also known as endothelium-derived relaxation factor (EDRF), which causes vasodilation. L-arginine can improve coronary endothelial function and brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilation and reduce monocyte/endothelial cell adhesion in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or hypercholesterolemia, resulting in increased coronary blood flow (110, 116, 1362, 1363, 3330, 13710, 14913, 32017).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn human research, L-arginine does not seem to have anti-inflammatory effects based on blood levels of inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (102589, 102590, 112128). Similarly, L-arginine does not seem to alter levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (112128). In some individuals, including those over 60 years and those with cancer, CRP levels might be increased (102589).\nAntibacterial effects\nL-arginine has been studied for antibacterial effects (32013, 31909, 32041, 32024, 32196). Nitric oxide might be involved in host inflammatory and microbial killing responses (3460). When used in the mouth, L-arginine is thought to be converted to ammonia by oral non-pathogenic bacteria, increasing the local pH and reducing the cariogenicity of other bacteria (96806).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in L-arginine for adjunctive use in treating breast cancer. The enzyme amino-peptidase N/CD13 (APN) has been associated with the growth of cancers such as breast cancer. Laboratory research shows that certain L-arginine derivatives inhibit the APN N/CD13 enzyme (32092). In addition, there is some evidence that L-arginine modifies immune system function and might potentiate tumor cell response to anti-cancer drugs and possibly reduce the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy agents. L-arginine seems to increase lymphocyte reactivity to polyclonal mitogenic agents and might also enhance natural cytotoxicity (3331). However, L-arginine also promotes the growth of tumors by providing a source of nitrogen. In some situations the nutritional value of L-arginine may outweigh its antitumor effects (7814).\nAnticonvulsive effects\nNitric oxide can help prevent seizures. L-arginine can increase nitric oxide levels. Animal research shows that giving L-arginine to rats with drug-induced seizures increases the time to first seizure and decreases seizure-induced mortality. This therapeutic effect may be due to increased nitric oxide levels (32121).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPeople with diabetes appear to have lower than normal levels of L-arginine, and increased levels of the enzyme asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADME), which might contribute to peripheral vascular disease in people with diabetes (14913). L-arginine is metabolized to L-ornithine, then to L-proline, which is used in collagen synthesis and wound healing (14914). However, if metabolized through a different pathway, L-arginine may have a negative effect on diabetic ulcers. Increased levels of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) can increase the metabolism of L-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) and may impair diabetic ulcer healing due to NO's free radical effects on tissues (14915). L-arginine may help increase glucose disposal (31875), increase insulin sensitivity (32269), and increase plasma insulin levels in response to meals (32136) in diabetic and pre-diabetic patients. It has been proposed that L-arginine increases adiponectin secretion in the adipose tissue and may increase insulin sensitivity by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, which can improve glucose uptake and utilization by the muscles (104225).\nAntioxidant effects\nResearch is conflicting on whether L-arginine protects against oxidative stress. Some evidence shows that L-arginine has antioxidant effects and can reduce lipid peroxidation. This might prevent damage by oxidant radicals and attenuate damage from numerous conditions including myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis, and stress (31926, 31931, 31964, 32161, 32179, 32259, 110385). However, a meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies shows that L-arginine does not improve antioxidant status as measured by superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. Additionally, 4 clinical studies in the meta-analysis found that L-arginine does not modulate markers of oxidative stress including thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, carbonyls, uric acid, malondialdehyde (MDA), neutrophil MDA, creatine, and lactate dehydrogenase (112128).\nCardiovascular effects\nL-arginine has been assessed for a number of cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. L-arginine has been studied for its antihypertensive effects. The production of NO from L-arginine and NO-induced vasodilation may be responsible for mildly reducing blood pressure (10636, 32266). However, a meta-analysis of patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, shows that taking L-arginine does not improve flow-mediated dilation or NO (99262). L-arginine reduces the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme, decreasing the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and also increases aldosterone, which signals for increased water and sodium retention. Therefore, the blood pressure lowering effects of L-arginine can be attributed to reducing angiotensin I conversion (7820).\n\nSome evidence is available indicating the effect on coronary blood flow is larger in African-Americans than in Caucasians (8472). L-arginine seems to prevent nitrate tolerance by improving nitric acid bioavailability and may act as an antioxidant, decreasing production of vascular superoxide (8475).\n\nThe production of NO from L-arginine substrate is impaired in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) (8016). Intravenous L-arginine can have many beneficial hemodynamic effects in heart failure, including decreased heart rate (8 beats/minute), decreased mean arterial pressure (14 mmHg), increased cardiac output (0.7 l/minute), and increased stroke volume (14 mL) (8444).\n\nThe beneficial effect of L-arginine on NO may help patients with vaso-occlusive crisis or pulmonary hypertension secondary to sickle cell disease. Adults and children experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis have lower plasma concentrations of arginine when compared to sickle cell patients not experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (97392). L-arginine donates nitrogen for NO synthesis. L-arginine also decreases levels of circulating plasma endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor (11428). In most people with a normal diet, the concentration of L-arginine inside the cells of the body is adequate to ensure that the NOS enzyme is producing NO at maximal capacity. As a result, L-arginine supplementation is likely to be more effective in patients who have a deficiency of L-arginine (7820).\n\nL-arginine has actions on the cardiovascular system and other systems that are independent of the conversion to NO. Among other actions, L-arginine can directly reduce blood viscosity, reduce the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme, and reduce lipid peroxidation (7820). The decrease in blood viscosity can be attributed to L-arginine induced decreases in platelet aggregation (31864, 32188, 32220, 32239, 32257, 32260, 32263, 32276). However, L-arginine does not seem to have anti-inflammatory effects based on blood levels of inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (102589, 102590). In some individuals, including those over 60 years and those with cancer, CRP levels might be increased (102589).\nExercise effects\nL-arginine has been used to improve exercise performance. It is possible that L-arginine works by improving oxygen utilization in active young adult males (32104). However, L-arginine supplementation does not seem to have this effect in trained athletes (32170, 32158).\n\nL-arginine supplementation in healthy adults and trained athletes may reduce levels of creatine kinase, lactate, and/or ammonia during or following exercise. It is unclear if these changes are significant enough to play a role in improved exercise performance (31894, 110381, 110389, 116207).\n\nFinally, in rats, L-arginine oral supplementation appears to attenuate oxidative stress that is induced by exercise (32005).\nGenitourinary effects\nBesides its effect on the systemic cardiovascular system, NO also increases the relaxation of urinary tract smooth muscle (3259, 3460, 31878) and is involved in erectile function. Although L-arginine appears to be helpful for erectile dysfunction, L-arginine may not affect the hemodynamics of the corpus cavernosum (222). L-arginine also increases gastrin concentrations and inhibits tubular reabsorption of protein (3331, 3460, 8015). L-arginine can increase renal plasma flow and decrease renal vascular resistance, and increase glomerular filtration rate, natriuresis, kaliuresis, and creatinine clearance in some patients (7822, 31839, 31860, 31879, 31904, 31910, 31962, 32062, 32224, 32251)(32284, 104222).\nHeavy metal protective effects\nL-arginine may have protective effects for heavy metal exposure. In animals, L-arginine appears to reduce mercury accumulation in the thymus after exposure to mercury (32058).\nHormonal effects\nPhysiologic actions of L-arginine include stimulating the release of growth hormone (GH), prolactin, glucagon, and insulin (7820, 31862). L-arginine also increases levels of testosterone in males (102586, 104222).\nImmunological effects\nL-arginine enhances immune function in laboratory research, as well as in human research when given with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (5532, 5533, 7819, 32036, 32109, 32192). In patients with colorectal cancer, L-arginine improved cellular and humoral immune activity via an increase in CD4+ T cells and IgA, IgG, and IgM levels, (117114). However, in elderly immunocompromised nursing home residents with pressure ulcers, L-arginine supplementation did not appear to improve or worsen immune function (31863, 31946). Supplementing sickle cell patients with L-arginine also did not result in notable improvement in immune function (32171).\nNeurological effects\nL-arginine may have neuroprotective effects. In an animal amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model, L-arginine protected motor neurons from injury, delayed onset of motor dysfunction, and prolonged life span. This protective effect may be attributed to preservation of arginase I activity and neuroprotective polyamines in the spinal cord (32088).\nNutrigenomics\nThe arginase 1 (ARG1) and arginase 2 (ARG2) genes may impact the bioavailability of L-arginine in humans. Observational research in L-arginine supplement users found that a higher prevalence of the minor allele of ARG1 rs2246012 is associated with higher blood L-arginine concentrations. Genetic variation in ARG1 may impact L-arginine absorption. Genetic variation in ARG2 genes may impact arginine levels in adults that do not take L-arginine supplements (105061).\nOcular effects\nIn healthy volunteers, L-arginine increases choroidal blood flow and retinal vein blood flow which may be helpful for patients with glaucoma (31948).\nPulmonary effects\nInhaling L-arginine increases the production of nitric oxide in the lungs. Orally, animal models show L-arginine decreases airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. However, in humans, L-arginine does not seem to reduce inflammation or improve lung function (96807, 104223).\nReproductive effects\nL-arginine has been used to help with infertility. Laboratory research suggests that nitric oxide from L-arginine may stimulate motility and metabolism of sperm from asthenospermic patients (32163). L-arginine supplementation affects nitric oxide production and improves uterine blood flow and endometrial thickness in females (104224).\nWeight loss effects\nL-arginine has been studied for weight loss in obese patients (91193). In animals, dietary L-arginine appears to increase lipolysis in adipose tissue (32173). Some human research suggests that L-arginine can increase the production of postprandial hormones involved in appetite suppression, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) (110397).\nWound-healing effects\nL-arginine is metabolized to L-ornithine, then to L-proline, which is used in collagen synthesis and wound healing (14914). L-arginine is a precursor for collagen synthesis and together with fibroblast NO production is thought to be important for wound healing (3259, 3260)."

Collagen crosslinking deficiency is part of this disorder. This can result in bone pain and skeletal deformities, a condition known as osteolathyrism (58026, 58029, 58038). In two patients, osteolathyrism resulted in a fusion failure of the vertebral and iliac epiphyses (58038). Other findings related to osteolathyrism include an absence of ossification centers of the iliac crests, ischial tuberosities, and vertebrae, and a bowing with thickening of the femoral shaft (58026).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, lathyrus consumption is associated with the disease lathyrism.

Symptoms of neurolathyrism include muscular rigidity, spasticity, weakness, paralysis of leg muscles, weak pulse, shallow breathing, convulsions, or death (6). Prolonged neurotoxicity is characterized by poor central motor coordination and reduced nerve conduction in the lower limbs (6, 58008, 58021, 58023, 58034, 58036). Other symptoms include increased micturition and neurogenic bladder (58027, 58036).

The neurotoxic effects are linked to the constituent beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha, beta-diaminopropionic acid (beta-ODAP). Beta-ODAP is a neurotoxin, which can cause irreversible paralysis by affecting predominantly Betz cells (58002, 58009, 58012, 58013, 58014, 58018, 58024, 58033, 58034, 58038). Several methods have been evaluated for deactivation of beta-ODAP. Typically, they involve soaking the seeds in water followed by steaming or sun drying. Roasting the seeds at high temperatures for twenty minutes also helps to destroy the neurotoxic constituent. However, these methods are only 80-85% effective (6). Lathyrus does not result in neurotoxicity in most people. It is thought that some people are able to metabolize or detoxify beta-ODAP (58012). Beta-ODAP is structurally similar to the excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate, possibly inducing excitotoxicity as an agonist of non-NMDA receptors (59002, 58013, 58018, 58039).\n\nThe constituent beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) causes skeletal abnormalities and damage to blood vessels (6).

Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, there is no evidence that L. sakei is beneficial for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLatilactobacillus sakei is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. It is found naturally in humans, as well as in some fermented foods. L. sakei is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605, 101513, 108583, 110906, 110907, 110908). Most researchers agree that the effectiveness of L. sakei and other probiotics for all indications depends on its ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAnti-obesity effects\nProbiotic bacteria are of interest for obesity prevention and treatment. This is related to differences in the microbiota composition, including the increased abundance of Firmicutes and Clostridia, and reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes, in adults with obesity versus non-obesity (110908). Clinical research related to the use of Latilactobacillus sakei for body fat reduction or maintenance is limited. One clinical trial in adults with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 25 kg/m2 shows that taking L. sakei CJLS03 does not reduce body weight although there is a small effect on body fat and waist circumference (110907). The mechanism of action is unclear.\n\nSome research shows that L. sakei, but not other lactobacilli, is more prevalent in the fecal microbiota of adults with obesity when compared with adults with non-obesity. However, this does not seem to be a cause of obesity and may be related to dietary fat intake and not body fat mass. In humans, L. sakei is more prevalent in the feces of adults with the highest vs. lowest fat intake, independent of body mass index (BMI). Also, animal and/or in vitro research suggest that a diet higher in saturated fat promotes reactive oxygen species formation in the colon, promoting the growth of the catalase-producing L. sakei ob4.1 which is involved in the maintenance of colon epithelial cell adhesion (110908). This suggests that L. sakei may have beneficial effects.\nCardiovascular effects\nProbiotic bacteria are of interest for cardiovascular disease prevention. Some probiotic bacteria seem to bind bile acids to cholesterol, resulting in increased bile acid-cholesterol excretion. They also seem to increase fatty acid production in the intestine, which decreases circulatory fatty acid concentrations either by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis or redistributing cholesterol from the plasma to the liver (8559). Although the effects of Latilactobacillus sakei on cholesterol levels have not been shown in humans, some in vitro research suggests that L. sakei might prevent cholesterol synthesis. In human hepatoma cells, L. sakei UONUMA strains were found to inhibit the production of the enzyme sterol-delta24-reductase (DHCR24), but not 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase or other enzymes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (110906).\nImmunological effects\nClinical research in patients with atopic dermatitis shows that taking live, but not heat-killed, Latilactobacillus sakei reduces levels of eosinophils. However, there was no effect on levels of Immunoglobulin E or on eosinophil activities (108583). Due to discrepancies with findings between trials, the effect of taking L. sakei on levels of chemokines in the promotion of T cell activation is unclear (108583, 110909)."

It is found in coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and vegetable fats (106418).\nCholesterol effects\nLauric acid is a saturated fatty acid and therefore contributes to increased heart disease risk if present in the diet in large amounts. Like the trans-fatty acids, it increases total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but in contrast, it also increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (14082). Therefore, lauric acid might not increase heart disease risk as much as trans-fatty acids. Lauric acid does not seem to affect triglyceride or lipoprotein(a) levels (14083, 14084, 14085, 14087).\nCoagulation effects\nSome preliminary clinical research suggests that lauric acid might increase levels of coagulation factor VIIa in females, but not in males (14088).\nGlycemic effects\nPreliminary research in young, healthy males shows that infusing lauric acid into the duodenum at a rate of 0.3 kcal/minute for 90 minutes moderately reduces the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of plasma glucose when compared with an infusion of saline. It does not affect plasma insulin or glucagon levels, or glucose to insulin ratio. It is thought to reduce postprandial glucose levels by slowing gastric emptying and increasing release of the gut incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which enhances hepatic and peripheral glucose uptake (106420). Additionally, a very small clinical crossover study in healthy lean males receiving a nutrient drink shows that infusing lauric acid into the duodenum at a rate of 0.3 kcal/minute for 45 minutes alone or in combination with L-tryptophan appears to have mixed results on plasma glucose AUC, gastric emptying, plasma cholecystokinin (CCK), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). The combination of lauric acid and L-tryptophan modestly delays the rise in glucose, slows gastric emptying, and stimulates CCK and GLP-1, but does not affect overall glucose response. Lauric acid infusion alone may delay the rise in C-peptide and insulin when compared with control, but not when compared with L-tryptophan (112005).\nMetabolic effects\nIn animal research, administering lauric acid (a medium-chain saturated fatty acid) results in fewer metabolic derangements than administering palmitic acid (a long-chain saturated fatty acid). Feeding mice a high-fat diet containing 3% lauric or palmitic acid for 12 weeks increases body weight, total fat mass, and hepatic steatosis in all mice. However, when compared with the palmitic acid diet, the lauric acid diet increases visceral fat mass, reduces inflammation, and improves muscle glucose uptake. It also has less effect on systemic insulin resistance, liver weight, or liver function tests when compared with palmitic acid (106418).\nPsychological effects\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy females shows that administering 2.5 grams of lauric acid via nasogastric tube does not influence emotion ratings after experimental induction of positive or negative emotions when compared with administration of saline (106422).\nSatiety effects\nPreliminary research in young, healthy males shows that infusing lauric acid into the duodenum at a rate of 0.4 kcal/minute for 90 minutes decreases the energy intake from a meal eaten immediately after the infusion, when compared with an infusion of saline (106419). This effect is thought to be due to stimulation of cholecystokinin release and suppression of ghrelin release in the gut (106421). This decrease in energy intake is not seen when lauric acid is infused at a slower rate (106421)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAnxiety. Orally, lavender seems to improve anxiety in some patients. Lavender oil aromatherapy and aromatherapy massage also seem to improve chronic and situational anxiety in some patients.\nGuidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that lavender essential oil at doses of 80-160 mg daily or dried lavender flower at doses of 500-1500 mg twice daily is provisionally recommended for monotherapy or adjunctive use in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Essential oil capsules and standardized dried flower formulations are preferred over tea preparations (110318). Additionally, guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Society for Integrative Oncology provide a weak recommendation for the use of lavender essential oil inhalation in people with cancer procedure-related anxiety. The recommendation is based on low-quality evidence (114626, 114642).\n\nMost meta-analyses and clinical trials in patients with subthreshold anxiety, mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and mild to severe anxiety show that taking capsules containing a specific lavender oil ingredient (Silexan, Dr Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. KG) 80-160 mg orally daily for 6-10 weeks improves objective and subjective measures of anxiety and increases response rates and complete remission rates when compared with placebo. However, heterogeneity and small sample sizes limit the validity of these findings (58077, 58080, 58098, 95640, 97257, 103061, 103069, 112255, 114628). Subgroup analyses of 5 clinical studies suggest that Silexan is more effective in older adults with higher somatic symptom burden and those with anxiety-related difficulties in concentration and poor memory at baseline (112255). Additionally, an individual patient-level analysis of 5 clinical studies shows that while Silexan is beneficial in mild to severe anxiety, treatment effects may be more pronounced in those with greater severity at baseline (114628).\n\nLimited research has compared Silexan to some conventional prescription medications. One clinical study shows that taking Silexan 80 mg daily for 6 weeks improves anxiety and quality of sleep similarly to low-dose lorazepam 0.5 mg in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (58077). Another clinical study in adults with generalized anxiety disorder shows that taking Silexan 80-160 mg daily for 10 weeks reduces symptom severity similarly to paroxetine 20 mg daily (93004). A network meta-analysis suggests that the higher dose of Silexan (160 mg) might be more effective when compared with paroxetine 20 mg or lorazepam 0.5 mg (103069).\n\nLimited research has assessed other oral formulations of lavender. A small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with mild to moderate anxiety shows that taking a dried lavender flower powder 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces anxiety by about 6% when compared with placebo, as measured on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (97256). The clinical significance of this improvement is not clear.\n\nLavender aromatherapy has also been evaluated. Meta-analyses of clinical trials in adults with chronic or situational anxiety show that inhalation aromatherapy or aromatherapy massage using lavender oil moderately reduces anxiety when compared with control. Most often, the control group received no intervention although occasionally they received standard or routine care. In some studies, plain water or diluted lemon juice were used as controls. Most treatments with lavender aromatherapy were given as single sessions of 1-30 minutes. However, occasionally multiple sessions were used (101720, 103061, 109974). A meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in adults undergoing hemodialysis shows that aromatherapy with 2% to 100% lavender oil reduces anxiety when compared with control groups receiving no intervention (114625). Most other individual clinical trials of aromatherapy with lavender, alone or in combination with bergamot, are in agreement with these findings (58103, 95637, 97258, 99713, 101722, 101724, 108752, 109854, 109981, 116183), although some research does not support the use of lavender aromatherapy for anxiety (29504, 58053, 97258, 101724, 109853). The poor quality of most of the available research makes it difficult to determine which patients, if any, are most likely to benefit.\nless\nDepression. Oral lavender, in the form of tea, tincture, powder, or a specific oil (Silexan), seems to reduce depressive symptoms in some adults. Clinical research also shows that lavender oil aromatherapy may improve symptoms of depression.\nGuidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that lavender essential oil at doses of 80-160 mg daily or dried lavender flower at doses of 500-1500 mg twice daily is weakly recommended for monotherapy or adjunctive use in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) (110318). Essential oil capsules and standardized dried flower formulations are preferred over tea preparations.\n\nA meta-analysis of five clinical trials shows that oral lavender is moderately more beneficial than a control group for reducing symptoms of depression (109860). Most studies included in the analysis were low- to moderate-quality with variation in patient demographics. Studies in the analysis investigated the effects of oral lavender oil or powder in menopausal or postpartum adults, or in adults with MDD, and compared lavender with routine care, placebo, medication, or no intervention. Doses have included powdered lavender leaves 1-2 grams daily for 8 weeks, lavender tea made from 2 grams powder per teabag once or twice daily for 2 weeks, and a specific oral capsule containing lavender oil (Silexan, Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. KG) 80 mg daily for 70 days (103060, 104433, 109860).\n\nSome research has compared lavender with traditional antidepressants. A large clinical study in adults with mild to moderate MDD shows that taking Silexan 80 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces symptoms of depression as measured on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and also improves functional impairment, when compared with placebo. These improvements were similar to those seen in a control group taking sertraline 50 mg daily (114631). Conversely, a small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate MDD shows that drinking 60 drops per day of a 1:5 tincture of lavender appears to be slightly less effective than imipramine 100 mg daily; however, lavender might have some additive antidepressant effects when used in combination with imipramine (9792). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size.\n\nLavender has also been taken in combination with other products. A small clinical study in adults with depression and anxious distress shows that taking 5 mL of a syrup containing lavender flower extract and Chinese dodder extract twice daily for 6 weeks seems to reduce depression to a similar degree as citalopram 20 mg daily (104437). It is unclear if the benefit is due to lavender, Chinese dodder, or the combination.\n\nLavender oil aromatherapy has also been evaluated. A meta-analysis of nine clinical trials shows that lavender oil aromatherapy is moderately more beneficial than control for reducing symptoms of depression. Most studies included in the analysis were low- to moderate-quality with variation in patient demographics. Studies in the analysis investigated the effects of lavender oil aromatherapy in a variety of populations, and no studies were specific to adults with MDD. Lavender aromatherapy was compared with no intervention, routine care, other aromatherapy oils, or distilled water (109860). A small clinical study in adults with post-stroke depression shows that lavender aromatherapy via microcapsules placed inside of a nonwoven bag under the pillow each night for 4 weeks reduces symptoms of depression when compared with control (114627). However, in hospitalized patients undergoing microvascular breast reconstruction, lavender oil aromatherapy does not improve symptoms of perioperative depression when compared with coconut oil (109853).\n\nLavender oil has also been studied in combination with other oils as aromatherapy. A small clinical study in community-dwelling older adults shows that inhalation or massage with lavender, sweet orange, and bergamot oils twice weekly for 8 weeks improves depressive symptoms in 55% to 65% of patients when compared with a control (98474). Another small clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that a combination of aromatherapy with lavender and bergamot oils three times daily for 8 weeks along with routine care modestly improves symptoms of depression when compared with routine care alone (109981). It is unclear if any benefit is due to lavender, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Limited clinical research suggests that lavender oil aromatherapy might reduce dysmenorrhea symptoms.\nA clinical study in young adults with dysmenorrhea shows that applying 3 drops of lavender oil to a piece of cotton and inhaling for 30 minutes daily for the first 3 days of menstruation modestly reduces pain when compared to inhaling the scent of diluted milk (95635). Another small clinical study in patients with dysmenorrhea shows that applying 3 drops of lavender oil to the hands and inhaling for 5 minutes every 6 hours for the first 3 days of menstruation seems to reduce abdominal pain and backache when compared with inhaling the scent of sesame oil (90510). Lavender oil has also been added to abdominal massage. A clinical crossover study in young females with dysmenorrhea shows that administering a gentle abdominal massage with lavender essential oil for 15 minutes moderately reduces pain immediately after treatment when compared with a massage with petrolatum (58106). It is unclear if the benefit persists after the end of the treatment. Additionally, because all available research has been conducted in the Middle East, it is unclear if these results can be extrapolated to other geographic locations.\nless\nPain (acute). Most clinical research suggests that lavender aromatherapy modestly reduces acute pain from needle insertion or other procedures in infants and adults. The benefit of oral lavender or lavender aromatherapy for other forms of acute pain is unclear.\nLavender oil aromatherapy has shown modest benefit for limiting acute pain in adults undergoing a variety of medical procedures. A meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies shows that lavender aromatherapy, inhaled or as topical application, reduces the severity of pain experienced with arteriovenous fistula catheter insertion for hemodialysis when compared with control (114632). A clinical study in adults with diabetes shows that topical lavender oil sprayed 3 times on the arm five minutes before insulin injection reduces injection site pain when compared with placebo (112254). Additionally, a clinical study in adults undergoing surgical drain removal shows that administering lavender aromatherapy as 2 drops of lavender oil in the oxygen mask reduces pain similarly to a cold compress and to a greater extent than oxygen alone or a control group receiving no intervention (114633). Clinical research also shows that inhaling 10% lavender oil from a heat lamp for 10-15 minutes prior to gynecological exams reduces pain experienced during the exam when compared with no treatment (95639). However, lavender aromatherapy may not reduce pain related to extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL). A clinical study in adults with kidney stones shows that inhaling 4 drops of diffused lavender oil does not reduce pain or the use of self-administered opioids after ESWL when compared with standard care. These results were unchanged when lavender aromatherapy was combined with music (112258). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding and the high variability in kidney stone size between groups.\n\nLavender oil aromatherapy also seems to modestly reduce pain in infants undergoing various medical procedures. One clinical study in term infants shows that aromatherapy with lavender oil 0.5% for one minute before vaccination modestly reduces pain and decreases crying time by about 20 seconds when compared with sweet almond oil (109869). Another small clinical study in term infants shows that being placed in an incubator with lavender essential oil scent overnight before receiving a blood draw modestly reduces overall pain scores to a similar extent as 2 mL of 30% glucose solution and to a greater extent than no intervention (103066). A small clinical study in preterm infants shows that inhaling the scent of 6 lavender oil drops on a cotton ball for 3 minutes before and 30 seconds after a heel-lancing procedure reduces pain scores when compared with exposure to an unscented cotton ball (104442). Another small clinical study in preterm infants shows that placing cotton soaked with lavender oil in front of the infant's nose for 5 minutes before and 2 minutes after venipuncture reduces pain intensity during and after venipuncture to a similar extent as cotton soaked in breastmilk but to a greater extent than cotton soaked with distilled water (114638). A small clinical study also shows that applying a gauze pad containing one drop of lavender oil under the nose, starting 2 minutes before frenotomy and continuing throughout the procedure, modestly reduces pain when compared with routine care, which includes swaddling, oral sucrose, and pre-frenotomy sucking. Post-frenotomy crying was also reduced by about 50%, or 10 seconds (109868). Lavender oil seems to be similarly effective to vanilla oil for this purpose (109810).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCancer-related pain. Using lavender oil for massage or as an aromatherapy diffusion does not seem to provide any additional pain relief in patients with advanced or terminal cancer.\nClinical research in patients with advanced or terminal cancer shows that diffusing lavender oil as aromatherapy or using lavender oil for massage does not improve pain scores when compared with control treatments without lavender oil (29504, 58053).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlopecia areata. Topical lavender oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with alopecia areata shows that applying lavender oil in combination with essential oils from thyme, rosemary, and cedarwood daily for 7 months seems to improve hair growth in 44% of participants when compared with 15% of those using only carrier oils (5177). It is unclear if this effect is due to lavender oil, other oils, or the combination.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Although there is interest in using topical lavender oil for eczema, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lavender oil for this condition.\nBurns. It is unclear whether lavender oil aromatherapy is beneficial as adjunct treatment for reducing pain associated with dressing changes in children with burns.\nPreliminary clinical research in young children with second-degree burns shows that lavender oil aromatherapy, provided as 0.5 mL dripped onto a gauze pad and placed 20 cm away from the child's nose for 15 minutes before a dressing change, modestly reduces pain severity at 1 and 30 minutes after the dressing change when compared with placebo aromatherapy with jojoba oil. Use of lavender oil aromatherapy also attenuated increases in heart and respiratory rates after the dressing change (109857).\nless\nCancer-related fatigue. It is unclear whether lavender oil aromatherapy is beneficial for reducing cancer-related fatigue in adults.\nA clinical study of adults in Iran with various forms of cancer shows that applying two drops of lavender oil 100% to a cotton ball attached to the collar for 20 minutes at bedtime for 5-7 days modestly improves sleep when compared to a control group receiving lavender oil 1% and may be similarly effective to peppermint oil (103063). The validity of this study is limited by the inclusion of patients with various forms of cancer, including hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.\nless\nCanker sores. Topical lavender oil might improve canker sore healing and reduce swelling and pain.\nA clinical study shows that applying 2 drops of lavender oil to canker sores three times daily might reduce redness, swelling, and pain when compared with placebo (58099).\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. It is unclear whether lavender oil aromatherapy is beneficial for reducing fatigue in hospitalized adults undergoing chemotherapy.\nA single-blind clinical study in adults in Turkey who were receiving chemotherapy for hematological malignancies and had been hospitalized for at least 6 days shows that applying 2 drops of lavender oil on a sponge placed on the shoulder for 20 minutes prior to bed for 5 nights slightly improves patient-reported fatigue and sleep quality when compared with a control group using normal saline (116184). The clinical significance of these small improvements is unclear.\nless\nColic. Two clinical studies suggest that lavender oil, applied topically during massage of the belly or inhaled as aromatherapy, might modestly reduce duration of crying in infants with colic.\nA small clinical trial shows that using lavender oil diluted with almond oil to massage the belly of infants for 5-15 minutes beginning at the onset of colic reduces average weekly crying times by about 7 hours when compared with infants not receiving aromatherapy massages (58096). It is unclear if this effect is due to lavender oil, massage, or the combination. Another moderate-sized clinical study in infants 4-8 weeks old with colic shows that inhaling lavender oil as aromatherapy for 4-6 hours daily for 7 days reduces the duration of night crying when compared with placebo (112260).\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Small clinical studies suggest that lavender aromatherapy might modestly improve sleep and reduce pain in patients who have undergone CABG surgery.\nOne small clinical study shows that placing three drops of lavender oil (Barich Essence Company) on the pillow every night for 5 nights modestly improves sleep quality, but not sleep latency, duration, or efficiency, when compared with placebo (109861). Another small clinical study shows that placing 2 drops of lavender oil on a cotton ball for overnight aromatherapy starting on the second evening after surgery modestly improves sleep quality on the second and third nights of use, but not the first night, when compared with distilled water (109856). Also, a small clinical study shows that applying 5 drops of lavender oil 20% to a gauze which is worn around the neck for 30 minutes after CABG surgery modestly reduces postoperative pain on the day of surgery and the day after surgery when compared with pre-aromatherapy pain levels. These changes were greater than those seen in patients inhaling distilled water (109850). However, one small clinical study shows that inhaling 2 drops of lavender oil 2% for 20 minutes on postoperative days 2 and 3 does not reduce mental stress when compared with placebo (93009).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral lavender is beneficial for improving the symptoms of mild to moderate COVID-19.\nA small clinical trial in adults with olfactory dysfunction related to COVID-19 shows that taking lavender syrup 9 mL twice daily for 3 weeks in combination with routine treatments modestly reduces symptoms when compared with routine treatments alone. However, there was no change in symptom scores or the percentage of participants with complete improvement in olfactory or taste dysfunction. The lavender syrup was made by preparing a water extract of the dried aerial parts and mixing with honey and water (109864).\n\nA clinical study in adults with mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, suspected by not confirmed to be caused by COVID-19, shows that taking lavender syrup 9 mL twice daily for 3 weeks with standard care reduces severity of cough and anosmia, but not anxiety or any other respiratory symptoms, when compared with standard care alone (114635). The interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of a placebo group and the lack of confirmation of COVID-19 infection.\nless\nDementia. Small clinical studies suggest that diffused aromatherapy with lavender oil may modestly improve agitation symptoms in patients with dementia; however, lavender oil applied to the patient or the patient's clothes might not be beneficial.\nSome small and heterogeneous clinical studies in patients with dementia show that applying lavender oil aromatherapy via a diffuser for either 20 minutes twice daily, 2 hours daily, or once nightly for up to 3 weeks seems to improve agitation when compared with baseline, water, or a sunflower oil placebo (16393, 58052, 95632). However, using aromatherapy that is applied to the person's clothes or arms does not seem to help. Small clinical studies in patients with moderate or advanced dementia show that applying lavender oil to a pad attached to a patient's shirt does not reduce agitation when compared with placebo (12213, 99710). Another clinical study in nursing home residents with dementia and frequent agitated behavior shows that applying 1 mL of 30% lavender oil to each forearm does not reduce agitation or improve mood when compared with applying placebo oil (93014).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if lavender aromatherapy massage is beneficial for diabetic neuropathy.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with neuropathic pain related to diabetes shows that a gentle foot massage with lavender essential oil 3% in sunflower oil for 10 minutes nightly for 1 month reduces neuropathic pain and improves quality of life when compared with a placebo sunflower oil massage or routine care alone (109858).\nless\nFall prevention. It is unclear if lavender aromatherapy prevents falls in elderly patients.\nA clinical study in nursing home residents aged 65 years or older shows that attaching a patch with lavender oil (Aromaseal Lavender, Hakujuji Co.) onto the neckline of clothing once daily for one year seems to have a non-significant trend toward reduced fall incidence when compared with placebo (58101).\nless\nFatigue. Small clinical studies suggest that lavender aromatherapy may modestly reduce fatigue in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as kidney failure, heart disease, or cancer. The effects of lavender for fatigue in otherwise healthy adults is unclear.\nMost, but not all, small clinical studies in adults with kidney failure show that receiving aromatherapy with lavender essential oil during hemodialysis sessions for 4 weeks reduces fatigue when compared with baseline, a control group, or a placebo group (95642, 98524, 109867). A meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in patients undergoing hemodialysis shows that aromatherapy with 5% to 100% lavender essential oil reduces fatigue when compared with control groups inhaling almond oil or receiving no intervention (114625).\n\nLavender aromatherapy has also been tried in patients hospitalized with various forms of cardiac disease. A small clinical trial shows that placing 3 drops of lavender oil on a cotton ball and inhaling for 20 minutes nightly for 7 days improves fatigue scores by 21 points, compared with a 2-point improvement in those receiving placebo (107959). The validity of these findings is limited due to the short duration of treatment.\nless\nHypertension. Lavender has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults with mild hypertension shows that aromatherapy with lavender oil 0.3% and ylang ylang oil 0.7%, provided via a fabric sticker placed on participant shirt collars, modestly reduces systolic blood pressure after 3 days of use and heart rate after 14 days of use when compared with control stickers containing no essential oils (114641).\nless\nInsect repellent. Although there is interest in using topical lavender to repel insects, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lavender for this condition.\nInsomnia. Inhalation aromatherapy or aromatherapy massage with lavender oil may improve some subjective measures of sleep, but results are conflicting and improvements appear minimal at best. Additionally, most small clinical studies suggest it does not improve sleep in hospitalized patients.\nLavender oil aromatherapy seems to improve sleep quality in some patients, although it is unclear which patient populations may be most likely to be benefit. A clinical study in healthy college students with self-reported sleep problems shows that wearing a patch containing lavender oil 55 mcL on the chest, in addition to practicing sleep hygiene, improves self-reported sleep quality, but not sleep quantity, when compared with wearing a placebo patch (93012). Another small clinical study in elderly patients that have trouble sleeping in nursing homes shows that placing 2 drops of lavender oil to a cotton pad on a nightstand at bedtime for 4 weeks moderately improves sleep quality and reduces fatigue when compared with control (103062). A meta-analysis of three clinical trials shows that lavender modestly improves postpartum sleep quality when compared with control, including placebo or no intervention. However, each trial used a different form of lavender, including a topical cream, a tea, and aromatherapy. Also, the individual trials included in the analysis show that only the cream and aromatherapy resulted in statistically significant improvements in sleep quality (109866). Conversely, a small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with insomnia who received sleep hygiene guidance shows that inhaling lavender oil 6% before bed nightly for 1 month does not improve sleep quality when compared with sunflower oil. The oil was inhaled from the bottle for two, two-minute sessions and then poured on a cotton ball and placed near the head while sleeping (109852).\n\nLavender aromatherapy has also been evaluated for insomnia in patients with comorbid disease states. A clinical study in patients with insomnia and type 2 diabetes shows that lavender oil aromatherapy for 5 minutes at bedtime nightly for 4 weeks improves sleep when compared with almond oil (103065). Preliminary clinical research in adults with kidney failure shows that foot massage with lavender oil 1.5% for 3 weeks during hemodialysis modestly improves sleep quality when compared with routine care, but is no more effective than sweet orange oil (109859). Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with post-stroke depression shows that lavender aromatherapy via microcapsules placed inside of a nonwoven bag under the pillow each night for 4 weeks improves sleep quality, latency, and duration when compared with control (114627).\n\nAromatherapy with lavender oil does not seem to improve sleep in most hospitalized patients, including patients in intermediate care units, hospitalized cardiac patients, and in patients undergoing microvascular breast reconstruction. Aromatherapy treatments have included lavender aromatherapy throughout hospitalization, placing 3 mL of lavender oil 3 feet away from the bed during sleep, and hand and lower leg massage with lavender essential oil 1.5% in sweet almond oil at bedtime (93013, 101727, 109853). However, studies have generally been small and did not use proper controls. Also, some small clinical studies suggest that lavender aromatherapy might have modest beneficial effects in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (109856, 109861).\nless\nKidney failure. Small clinical studies suggest that lavender aromatherapy may modestly reduce fatigue and improve sleep quality in adults receiving hemodialysis. Lavender oil massage may also modestly improve symptoms of restless leg syndrome (RLS) in these patients.\nMultiple small studies have evaluated lavender aromatherapy, provided during hemodialysis sessions, for reducing fatigue. A small clinical study shows that applying 5% lavender essential oil (Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company) to a cotton ball on the patient's collar for inhalation for 15-20 minutes twice daily during each session for 1 month reduces fatigue by an additional 44% and 40% when compared with baseline and control, respectively (98524). Another preliminary clinical trial shows that applying lavender oil 7% in sweet almond oil to a gauze pad placed 20 cm from the patient's nose for 2 minutes improves fatigue when compared with placebo aromatherapy. By the third week of four total weeks of treatment, most patients given lavender oil aromatherapy had only mild fatigue, compared with moderate or severe fatigue in the control group (109867). Also, a small clinical trial shows that aromatherapy or aromatherapy foot massage with lavender and sweet orange oil for 10-20 minutes during each session for 2 months reduces fatigue when compared with no treatment. Aromatherapy massage seems to be more effective than aromatherapy alone (103068). However, one small clinical study shows that applying the oil for inhalation for 10 minutes during each session for 1 month does not reduce fatigue when compared with control (95642). The difference in these findings might be due to study size, lavender oil concentration, or the frequency and duration of aromatherapy sessions.\n\nLavender aromatherapy has also been evaluated for reducing insomnia in adults on hemodialysis. A small clinical study shows that foot massage with lavender oil 1.5% for 3 weeks during hemodialysis sessions modestly improves sleep quality when compared with routine care. However, it does not seem to be more effective than using sweet orange oil (109859).\n\nSome small clinical studies in patients undergoing hemodialysis show that massaging the feet or lower legs with lavender oil reduces the severity of RLS by up to 45% when compared with routine care, massage only, or baby oil as placebo (95638, 103064, 109865). However, massage with lavender oil does not seem to be more beneficial than glycerin oil 2% or sweet orange oil 1.5% for reducing RLS severity (103064, 109859). Doses have included 10-15 mL of 1.5% or 5% lavender oil for 10- to 45-minutes during hemodialysis sessions for 3-4 weeks (95638, 103064, 109859, 109865).\nless\nLabor pain. Small studies suggest that lavender oil aromatherapy may help to modestly reduce pain during childbirth.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in Iran shows that lavender oil aromatherapy applied by various means, such as mask or massage, reduces labor pain when compared with control (104440). All included studies were conducted in Iran, so it is unclear if the benefit can be extrapolated to other geographic locations.\nless\nLice. Topical lavender oil has only been evaluated in combination with other essential oils; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical studies in patients with head lice shows that applying lavender oil in combination with tea tree oil reduces the number of hatched and unhatched live lice when compared with control (19188, 19189). When applied with tea tree oil three times weekly, lavender oils seems to improve lice eradication when compared with two weekly treatments of pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide (19189). It is not known if these effects are due to tea tree oil, lavender, or the combination.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if either lavender aromatherapy or oral lavender reduce menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.\nA meta-analysis and individual clinical studies in postmenopausal adults show that lavender aromatherapy for 4-12 weeks, alone or in combination with other essential oils, reduces menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes when compared with placebo (95634, 99711, 103067). However, heterogeneity and small sample sizes limit the validity of these findings. A small clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that aromatherapy with lavender 2% oil for 20 minutes at bedtime every day for 1 month improves quality of life scores when compared to baseline (99711). Another small clinical study in menopausal adults shows that receiving aromatherapy with lavender oil and lemon oil for 5 minutes daily for 30 days seems to improve sleep and quality of life when compared with placebo (104439). However, a small clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that a combination of lavender and bergamot oils administered via inhalation three times daily for 8 weeks with routine care does not improve sexual function when compared with routine care alone (109981).\n\nOral lavender has also been evaluated for improving menopausal symptoms. A small clinical study in postmenopausal adults shows that taking lavender essential oil 80 mg daily by mouth for 2 months does not improve overall menopausal symptom scores when compared with placebo. Although it modestly improved symptoms of sexual dysfunction, it did not improve other vasomotor, physical, or psychological menopausal symptoms when compared with placebo (114629).\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if lavender aromatherapy improves migraine symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with migraine headaches shows that rubbing 2-3 drops of lavender oil on the upper lip for inhalation might reduce headache pain and associated symptoms such as nausea and photophobia. Of 129 headaches treated with lavender oil, 92 responded completely or partially, compared with 32 of 68 headaches in the placebo group (18209).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if lavender aromatherapy can improve memory in patients with MS.\nA small preliminary clinical trial in patients with MS shows that dripping 2 drops of lavender oil (Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company) on a cotton ball for inhalation for 10 minutes twice daily for 2 weeks improves working memory by a small amount when compared with inhaling distilled water (109855).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral lavender or lavender aromatherapy is beneficial for reducing fatigue in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS).\nA small clinical trial in adults with MS shows that taking lavender 600 mg three times daily for 60 days improves fatigue by a large amount when compared with placebo (109851). Another small clinical study in adults with MS living in Turkey shows that lavender aromatherapy, provided as 3 drops of lavender oil on cotton pads placed 15-20 cm from the bed pillow nightly for 30 days, reduces fatigue severity and improves sleep quality when compared with no intervention (114630).\nless\nNeuropathic pain. Although there is interest in using topical lavender oil for neuropathic pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lavender for this condition.\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if lavender aromatherapy with massage reduces osteoarthritis pain.\nA small clinical study in patients with osteoarthritis shows that applying 5 mL of 3% lavender oil (Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company) to the knee through self-administered massage three times weekly for 3 weeks can reduce pain by 23% when compared to massage with placebo oil and by 36% when compared with no treatment. However, any benefits of treatment begin to wear off after treatment completion (95645).\nless\nOtitis media. Topical lavender oil has only been evaluated in combination with other essential oils; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in children ages 5-18 years with otitis media and otalgia shows that administering ear drops containing lavender and other herbal extracts, alone or in combination with a topical anesthetic, improves ear pain when compared with baseline. However, it is possible that the pain is self-limited and any pain reduction is due to natural resolution (39500).\nless\nPerioperative anxiety. It is unclear if lavender aromatherapy is beneficial for perioperative anxiety.\nA large clinical study in adults shows that inhaling lavender 2% before, during, and after dental procedures reduces dental pain intensity and perioperative dental anxiety when compared with control. Inhaled lavender seems to have the greatest effect on perioperative anxiety when used in the waiting room (112250). Conversely, a clinical study in adults with kidney stones undergoing extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) shows that inhaling 4 drops of diffused lavender oil does not reduce anxiety when compared with standard opioid analgesia. These results were unchanged when lavender aromatherapy was combined with music (112258). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding and the high variability in kidney stone size between groups.\n\nLavender has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A clinical study in adults undergoing port catheter placement under modified anesthesia shows that preoperative and intraoperative placement of an aromatherapy patch containing lavender and peppermint essential oils (Elequil Aromatabs, Beekley Corporation) near the head does not reduce benzodiazepine or opioid requirements or time to discharge when compared with a placebo patch (114623). It is unclear if the use of an oxygen mask during the procedure resulted in inadequate exposure to the aromatherapy oils.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if lavender is beneficial for PCOS.\nA small clinical study in adults with PCOS between the ages of 18-45 who had not received any prior treatment for the condition shows that taking lavender 250 mg twice daily for 90 days increases serum progesterone levels and reduces menstrual cycle length similarly to metformin 500 mg three times daily (114634).\nless\nPostdural puncture headache. It is unclear if lavender aromatherapy improves postdural puncture headache severity.\nA small clinical study in adults with postdural puncture headache shows that receiving lavender oil aromatherapy for 15 minutes modestly improves pain immediately after treatment when compared with placebo. However, the pain relief is not maintained at 30 minutes after treatment (104441).\nless\nPostherpetic neuralgia. It is unclear if lavender aromatherapy is beneficial for alleviating pain in postherpetic neuralgia.\nA small clinical study in adults with postherpetic neuralgia shows that aromatherapy with either lavender oil 1% or oils containing two of its major constituents (linalool 1% or linalyl acetate 1%), placed on gauze and then inhaled with natural breathing for 5 minutes, reduces the intensity and severity of pain when compared with almond oil control (114624). The validity of this finding is limited by the short-term nature of the study; any benefit beyond 5 minutes was not evaluated.\nless\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if lavender aromatherapy reduces PONV.\nA small clinical study in postoperative patients shows that inhaling the scent of 2 drops of lavender oil from a cotton pad for 5 minutes improves nausea scores in 83% of people, compared with 44% of those inhaling a placebo. There was no difference in vomiting scores between groups (99712). Another small clinical study in patients after percutaneous nephrolithotomy shows that inhaling the scent of 3 drops of lavender essential oil from a gauze for 5 minutes immediately after the operation, and again 3 and 6 hours later, does not improve nausea or vomiting when compared with a control group that was not receiving aromatherapy (103872).\n\nA specific combination patch providing both lavender and peppermint essential oils (Elequil Aromatabs, Beekley Corporation) has also been evaluated, with conflicting findings. A clinical study in adults undergoing port catheter placement under modified anesthesia shows that preoperative and intraoperative placement of this patch near the head does not reduce antiemetic requirements, the proportion of patients requiring antiemetics, or average PONV scores when compared with a placebo patch (114623). It is unclear if the use of an oxygen mask during the procedure resulted in inadequate exposure to the essential oils. Conversely, a small clinical study in patients with anxiety prior to primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty shows that placement of this patch on the gown at least 1 hour before surgery, with re-application every 12 hours postoperatively for 2 days, reduces PONV on postoperative day 2 when compared with a placebo patch (114622). It is unclear if this effect is due to lavender, peppermint, or the combination.\nless\nPostoperative pain. The evidence for the use of lavender aromatherapy for pain after various types of surgical procedures is conflicting.\nSome small clinical studies in patients post-Cesarean section shows that, when used in conjunction with standard analgesic therapy, applying 2 drops of lavender oil 2% to a face mask or applying 3 drops of lavender to a cotton ball for inhalation modestly reduces postoperative pain when compared with control or placebo (58093, 101724, 116183). A small clinical study in adults undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery shows that applying lavender oil to a gauze which is worn around the neck may modestly reduce postoperative pain on the day of surgery and the day after surgery when compared with distilled water (109850). However, aromatherapy with lavender throughout hospitalization does not seem to improve postoperative pain in patients undergoing microvascular breast reconstruction when compared with coconut oil (109853). Additionally, a clinical study in adults hospitalized after abdominal surgery shows that a lavender oil-infused warm water foot bath for 20 minutes each night for 3 nights after surgery does not reduce postoperative pain when compared with a standard warm water foot bath (114637). Likewise, a clinical study in adults hospitalized after total knee or hip arthroplasty shows that lavender aromatherapy administered via inhalers and used as needed does not reduce pain or analgesic use when compared with control (114639).\n\nLavender oil aromatherapy has also been evaluated in children. A small clinical study in children aged 6-12 years post-tonsillectomy shows that rubbing lavender oil onto the palms and inhaling for 3 minutes every 6 hours as needed reduces acetaminophen use when compared with control (90513).\n\nA specific combination patch providing both lavender and peppermint essential oils (Elequil Aromatabs, Beekley Corporation) has also been evaluated, with conflicting findings. A clinical study in adults undergoing port catheter placement under modified anesthesia shows that preoperative and intraoperative placement of the patch near the head does not reduce time to readiness for discharge, opioid requirements, or pain intensity scores when compared with a placebo patch (114623). It is unclear if the use of an oxygen mask during the procedure resulted in inadequate exposure to the essential oils. Conversely, a small clinical study in patients with anxiety prior to primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty shows that placing the patch on the gown at least 1 hour before surgery, with re-application every 12 hours postoperatively for 2 days, reduces opioid use on postoperative day 2, as well as pain scores and acetaminophen use on postoperative day 7, when compared with a placebo patch (114622). It is unclear if any effect is due to lavender, peppermint, or the combination.\nless\nPostpartum complications. It is unclear if topical or inhaled lavender reduces postpartum complications such as pain and swelling.\nSome clinical research in patients receiving an episiotomy during childbirth shows that adding lavender oil to water or sitz baths for up to 10 days might reduce episiotomy redness and discomfort when compared with using no lavender and standard treatment, such as povidone-iodine. However, findings are mixed as to whether adding lavender oil to baths helps to reduce edema and analgesic use (58085, 58092, 58116, 58121).\n\nLavender aromatherapy has also been studied to improve wellbeing in postpartum patients. A small clinical study in postpartum patients immediately following a natural birth shows that inhaling lavender oil from a cotton ball for 10-15 minutes in the morning, 6 hours later, and at bedtime, improves perceived pain, fatigue, distress, and mood within 1 hour of treatment and also the next morning when compared with placebo (95631).\nless\nPostpartum depression. Small clinical studies suggest that aromatherapy with lavender oil may modestly improve or prevent depressive symptoms in postpartum patients.\nA clinical study in healthy postpartum patients shows that placing 3 drops of lavender essential oil on the palms three times daily for 4 weeks after delivery moderately reduces depressive symptoms and anxiety when compared with usual care only (95637). There is limited research on the benefits of lavender aromatherapy in patients diagnosed with postpartum depression. A small clinical trial in these patients shows that a combination of lavender and rose essential oils, administered via inhalation or aromatherapy massage using hand \"M\" technique for 15-minute sessions, twice weekly for 4 weeks, reduces depression scores when compared with no intervention (58103).\nless\nPre-procedural anxiety. It is unclear if lavender aromatherapy can reduce preoperative or preprocedural anxiety; results from clinical research are generally of low-quality and benefits are modest at best.\nA meta-analysis of four small clinical studies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery shows that lavender aromatherapy modestly reduces preoperative anxiety when compared with control (103058). Similarly, a meta-analysis of 19 small to moderate-sized clinical studies in adults undergoing various types of surgical procedures shows that lavender aromatherapy modestly reduces preoperative anxiety when compared with routine care or placebo (114636). However, most of the studies included in these meta-analyses were conducted in the Middle East, and it is unknown if these results are generalizable to other geographic areas. There is conflicting clinical evidence regarding the effect of lavender aromatherapy on anxiety prior to a dental procedure (58078, 101725, 103059). Small clinical studies also show mixed results as to whether lavender oil aromatherapy applied to a gauze bandage or oxygen mask improves anxiety in patients waiting for breast surgery when compared with usual care. (95641, 101729).\n\nLavender aromatherapy might reduce anxiety prior to less risky and extensive procedures such as needle injections. Small clinical studies in adults receiving botulinum toxin type A injections or children receiving dental injections show that lavender oil aromatherapy reduces heart rate and cortisol levels when compared with placebo (58089, 104438). Another clinical study in preoperative patients undergoing insertion of a peripheral venous cannula shows that inhalation of 1% lavender oil from a gauze pad for 5 minutes modestly reduces pain and anxiety scores and improves patient satisfaction when compared with control (95636). However, a clinical study in patients undergoing a colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows that inhaling lavender oil does not reduce anxiety, although it does improve patient satisfaction, when compared with placebo (58066). Reasons for conflicting findings are unclear but may relate to the severity of anxiety, the specific outcomes measured, and cultural differences occurring in different geographic locations.\nless\nPruritus. Topical lavender has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in older females with pruritus shows that aromatherapy massage utilizing a 4:1:1 mixture of lavender, Roman chamomile, and sandalwood oils diluted to 1.5% in sweet almond oil, three times weekly for 1 month, modestly improves pruritus and reduces pruritus-related stress when compared with sandalwood oil alone. However, it does not improve skin pH or level of hydration (112365). It is unclear if these findings are due to lavender, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPsychological well-being. It is unclear if topical or inhaled lavender improves well-being.\nA small clinical study in healthy females shows that adding 3 mL of a mixture containing 20% lavender oil and 80% grapeseed oil to daily baths modestly improves mood when compared with baths containing grapeseed oil alone (15534). However, lavender may not impact well-being in patients with cancer. Clinical research shows that that adding lavender oil for an aromatherapy massage in patients with advanced or terminal cancer does not improve well-being or quality of life when compared with no massage treatment or massage with inert oil (29504, 58053).\nless\nRestless legs syndrome (RLS). Most small clinical studies suggest that lavender oil aromatherapy massage may be beneficial for RLS in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Its benefits in other patient populations are unclear.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients undergoing hemodialysis show that massaging the feet or lower legs with lavender oil reduces the severity of RLS by up to 45% when compared with routine care, massage only, or baby oil as placebo (95638, 103064, 109865, 114632). However, massage with lavender oil does not seem to be more beneficial than glycerin oil 2% or sweet orange oil 1.5% for reducing RLS severity (103064, 109859). Doses have included 10-15 mL of 1.5% or 5% lavender oil for 10-45 minutes during hemodialysis sessions for 3-4 weeks (95638, 103064, 109859, 109865).\nless\nStress. Some clinical studies suggest that inhaling lavender oil as aromatherapy may reduce stress. However, overall research is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of 21 moderate- to high-quality, small- to medium-sized studies shows that inhaling lavender oil modestly reduces stress when compared with control. Most studies included in the analysis have used lavender oil as aromatherapy; other studies have used a cream (109863). In contrast, a clinical study in pharmacy students shows that inhaling lavender oil 3% in almond oil twice daily for 30 minutes during the exam period does not reduce academic stress or associated symptoms, including headache, blood pressure, or heart rate, when compared with inhaling an odorless oil, although both were more effective than no intervention (101723).\n\nLavender oil aromatherapy has shown conflicting results when evaluated for reducing stress in healthcare professionals. A small study in hospital nurses with work-related stress shows that inhaling lavender oil as aromatherapy for 2 hours daily for 4 weeks does not reduce job-related stress when compared with placebo or rose oil aromatherapy (112256). However, another small clinical study in healthcare professionals at an outpatient clinic shows that inhaling lavender oil through a diffuser during work shifts reduces work stress and increases job satisfaction when compared with placebo (112251).\nless\nToothache. Although there is interest in using topical lavender oil for toothache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lavender oil for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate lavender for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nA specific lavender oil ingredient (Silexan, Dr Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe) 80-160 mg daily has been commonly used for up to 10 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nInhalation (Aromatherapy):Lavender essential oil drops have been administered through various methods, including via application to the palms, application to a cotton pad attached to clothes, diluted with water and diffused, and many others.

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn clinical trials, lavender has been administered orally, topically, or via inhalation. When administered topically, lavender oil has been applied directly to the affected area, rubbed into the skin via massage, or added to bath water (5177, 58103, 58099, 95645, 15534, 95638, 114637). When administered via inhalation, lavender oil is commonly diluted to a 1% to 5% formulation, which can then be added to a diffuser or inhaler, or placed onto a cotton ball, gauze pad, or the inside of an oxygen face mask (16393, 58052, 58093, 58101, 58103, 95631, 95635, 95636, 95641, 95642)(98524, 114624, 114630, 114632, 114633, 114636, 114641). It has also been microencapsulated and placed in non-woven fabric pouches (114627).\n\nIn most research, lavender oil is not standardized to specific constituents. However, several trials have evaluated a standardized proprietary lavender oil ingredient (Silexan, Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. KG) ( 114628,114631). This proprietary lavender oil is prepared from fresh flowering tops of lavender by steam distillation, and the final product is standardized to contain about 70% linalool and linalyl acetate. The product is available as immediate-release soft gelatin capsules in 80 or 160 mg doses (93004).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with lavender.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nTopically, lavender oil is quickly absorbed by the skin. The lavender constituents linalool and linalyl acetate are detectable in the blood five minutes after topical application, peak at 19 minutes, and largely disappear from the blood within 90 minutes (58137). Orally, the linalool constituent of lavender is absorbed quickly (93007).\nExcretion\nOrally, the linalool constituent of lavender is eliminated quickly, with a half-life of 4 hours after a single dose and a half-life of 9 hours after 2 weeks of treatment (93007).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of lavender are the flowers, leaves, and oil. The flower contains rosmarinic acid (109851). Lavender contains several potential active constituents including cineole from the essential oil and borneol and camphor from the leaves (12219). The oil also contains linalool, perillyl alcohol, linalyl acetate, lavandulyl acetate, and carophyllene epoxide (16393, 58082, 114624, 114637). The aerial parts also contain chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid (114634).\nAnalgesic effects\nThere is some evidence that lavender has analgesic effects (7107, 58090, 58092, 58093, 58099).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal models, lavender leaf extract and essential oils seem to have anti-inflammatory properties (12219).\nAntibacterial effects\nEvidence from in vitro research shows that lavender oil has antibacterial activity against strains of nontuberculous mycobacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (58102, 58110, 58129).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is some interest in lavender as an anticancer agent. The constituent perillyl alcohol seems to have some anticancer activity in vitro and in animal models (6, 58117, 58119, 58131). Perillyl alcohol appears to induce apoptosis in cancer cells (58117).\nAntifungal effects\nEvidence from in vitro research shows that lavender oil and its constituent linalool can inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum (58061, 58136).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is some interest in using lavender to lower cholesterol levels. Theoretically, lavender might potentiate the effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors due to the cineole and perillyl alcohol content (6, 58113). Also, some research suggests that the lavender constituent perillyl alcohol reduces cholesterol synthesis by blocking the conversion of lathosterol to cholesterol (58122).\nEndocrine effects\nLavender oil has demonstrated modest estrogenic effects and antiandrogenic effects in vitro (15254). However, animal research in developing rats has not demonstrated estrogenic activity with topical application of doses equivalent to 5000 to 1,000,000 times the maximum estimated daily skin exposure in prepubescent males. Antiandrogenic activity of lavender oil in animals was not evaluated (95644).\nHair growth effects\nLavender might have stimulant effects on hair growth (5177). However, the mechanism of this effect is not known.\nMusculoskeletal effects\nThere is some evidence that lavender has spasmolytic effects on smooth muscle (6, 58044, 58107). In vitro research suggests that the lavender constituent cineole exerts spasmolytic effects by inhibiting acetylcholine-induced muscle contractions (58107).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nLavender seems to induce relaxation and sedation (58067). Lavender decreases EEG potentials and decreases alertness in humans (7). Lavender oil aromatherapy appears to reduce the time it takes to fall asleep, improve sleep, and reduce sleepiness at awakening (18208, 58062). This might be related to the increased melatonin levels following lavender oil inhalation as shown in older individuals (101721). Some preliminary clinical evidence shows that lavender increases arousal in humans (58067). However, other preliminary research shows that inhalation of lavender and bergamot oil decreases arousal (34415, 58100). There is also some evidence from animal models that lavender might have anticonvulsant effects and possibly potentiate chloral hydrate and pentobarbital effects (7, 58114). It is thought that the anticonvulsant effects of lavender may be due to the potentiation of the neurotransmitter GABA (58114).\nWound healing effects\nAnimal research and preliminary clinical research shows that, when applied topically, lavender oil can increase mucosal repair and accelerate the healing of recurrent aphthous ulceration. This effect may be due to the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects of lavender oil (58099)."

Laxogenin is found in low levels in many plants, and has been identified in Smilax sieboldii, chive, Allium chinense, and Solanum unguiculatum (99191, 99192, 99193). A similar compound, 5-alpha-hydroxy laxogenin, is synthetically derived from the plant compound diosgenin (99191).\nMuscle mass effects\nLaxogenin is taken to promote muscle growth. The theoretical effects of laxogenin are based on its role as a plant growth-promoting hormone. The structure of laxogenin is similar to that of animal steroid hormones (99191, 99194). There is no human or animal research showing that laxogenin or 5-alpha-hydroxy laxogenin promote muscle growth (99191).

However, oral supplementation with L-carnitine does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In fact, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that L-carnitine supplementation is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, as well as ventricular arrhythmias and the development of angina and does not increase the development of heart failure or myocardial reinfarction (59037). Also, another meta-analysis suggests that L-carnitine does not affect mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with a previous myocardial infarction (90630).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, L-carnitine has been reported to cause skin rash in a small number of cases (16105, 91724).\n\nTwo patients in a hair growth study using topical carnitine reported mild itching and increased dandruff, while a third reported strong itching with reddish bumps and a burning sensation (58390). When a specific formulation containing L-carnitine, licochalcone, and 1,2-decanediol was applied to the face, mild skin dryness and tightness was reported by 12% of volunteers, compared with 4% to 8% of those in the vehicle-only control group (26493).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally and intravenously, L-carnitine has been associated with nausea, epigastric discomfort, vomiting, abdominal cramps, heartburn, gastritis, anorexia, and diarrhea (3616, 3624, 59030, 95069, 95070, 101562, 107410, 111870, 111887, 111891).

Intravenous L-carnitine 3 grams in 500 mL of 5% dextrose, administered once daily for 14 days (59230), or intravenous DL-carnitine 40 mg/kg administered 30 minutes prior to exercise (59216) have also been used.\nless\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). Oral and intravenous L-carnitine may improve exercise capacity and symptoms of heart failure in patients with CHF.\nSeveral small clinical trials in patients with CHF show that taking L-carnitine 1.5-3 grams daily in single or divided doses for up to 34 months or administering intravenous L-carnitine 5 grams daily for 7 days seems to improve symptoms and increase exercise capacity when compared with placebo (3625, 3626, 58145, 58771, 58824). Also, taking a specific combination product containing L-carnitine 2250 mg and coenzyme Q10 270 mg (Carni Q-Gel, Tishcon Corporation) daily for 12 weeks appears to improve symptoms of CHF when compared with no treatment (58392).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral or intravenous L-carnitine may slightly improve lipid levels. Oral, but not intravenous, L-carnitine may also improve lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a).\nMost meta-analyses of clinical research in patients with or without hyperlipidemia show that L-carnitine, given orally at a dose of 76 mg to 3 grams daily or intravenously at a dose of 15-20 mg/kg three times weekly, appears to reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels by up to 9.5 mg/dL, 8.3 mg/dL, and 11.2 mg/dL, respectively, while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by up to 1.6 mg/dL. Sub-analyses in patients with elevated levels of specific lipids shows that L-carnitine might be most beneficial in these populations (95073, 102019, 111886). However, clinical research is generally very low to moderate quality. Also, any effects of L-carnitine on these lipids are modest and might not be considered clinically significant. An umbrella meta-analysis of meta-analyses of clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine orally reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels by only 1.1 mg/dL, 4.8 mg/dL, and 2.5 mg/dL, with increases in HDL cholesterol of 0.7 mg/dL (111896). More information is needed on the effects of L-carnitine on lipid levels specifically in patients with hyperlipidemia.\n\nSome research has also evaluated the benefits of L-carnitine in people with hyperlipidemia and elevated lipoprotein(a) levels or those undergoing hemodialysis. Preliminary clinical research and a meta-analysis of clinical research in these populations shows that taking L-carnitine 1-2 grams daily for 8-24 weeks reduces levels of lipoprotein(a) by about 9 mg/dL when compared with control (58155, 95073). However, giving L-carnitine intravenously 1 gram three times weekly or 4 grams daily does not improve lipoprotein(a) levels in these patients (95073). Also, oral or intravenous L-carnitine does not improve LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglyceride levels in these patients (58155, 95073). Whether L-carnitine reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with hyperlipidemia is unknown.\nless\nKidney failure. Intravenous, but not oral, L-carnitine is FDA-approved for the prevention and treatment of L-carnitine deficiency in patients with kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis. Any other benefits with the use of L-carnitine in patients on hemodialysis are unclear.\nPatients with kidney failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis often experience L-carnitine deficiency, which can lead to lipid, red blood cell, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle abnormalities (26496). Use of intravenous L-carnitine for the prevention and treatment of L-carnitine deficiency in people with kidney failure who are undergoing hemodialysis is an FDA-approved indication for L-carnitine. L-carnitine 10-20 mg/kg is given as a slow (2-3 minute) bolus injection, with dose adjustments made based on subsequent pre-dialysis L-carnitine concentrations (3616). However, oral L-carnitine is not FDA-approved for this purpose. There is concern that long-term administration of high doses of oral L-carnitine may result in accumulation of toxic metabolites, including trimethylamine and trimethylamine-N-oxide, in patients with kidney failure (3616).\n\nResearch in other areas are conflicting. Most clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 0.7-3 grams or 10 mg/kg daily or administering L-carnitine 2-6 grams or 30-60 mg/kg weekly via intravenous infusion can improve cardiac function, intravenous fistula complications, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and C-reactive protein levels in patients on hemodialysis (9790, 26496, 58257, 58437, 58842, 59009, 59178, 111877). A meta-analysis of 18 clinical studies in adults with kidney-related anemia undergoing hemodialysis shows that receiving oral or intravenous L-carnitine reduces erythropoietin responsiveness and erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) requirement, but not hemoglobin level, when compared with placebo or conventional therapy, regardless of treatment duration or route of administration (107406). Despite an earlier meta-analysis suggesting that L-carnitine does not reduce the incidence of dialysis-related hypotension or muscle cramping (58511), a more recent meta-analysis shows that L-carnitine reduces the incidence of dialysis-related hypotension by 74% when compared with placebo (111878). However, sub-analyses suggest that only oral L-carnitine, and doses of over 4.2 grams weekly for at least 12 weeks, are effective for preventing hypotension (111878). A meta-analysis and some preliminary clinical research also show that muscle cramping is reduced by up to 78% when compared with controls (104176, 111878). Additionally, observational research has found that administering at least 1 gram of L-carnitine per dialysis session for at least 10 sessions monthly is associated with a 10% to 20% decrease in the number of hospitalization days during the subsequent month (58409).\n\nHowever, L-carnitine may not be beneficial for improving other measures in people with kidney failure receiving dialysis. While some research shows that L-carnitine decreases lipoprotein(a) levels (44187), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (26496, 91723, 107399), and total cholesterol levels (107399), most research shows that it does not improve serum lipid levels (9790, 26496, 44187, 58257, 58320, 58842, 58939, 59009, 59025, 59031)(59036, 59059, 59080, 90633, 91723, 107399). Additionally, while one small clinical trial shows that taking L-carnitine can improve performance on some exercise tests (104179), most research shows that L-carnitine does not improve respiratory function or exercise performance. The effect on quality of life is unclear (58154, 58437, 58472, 58743, 59031, 90633, 111867, 111877).\nless\nMale infertility. Oral L-carnitine, taken alone or in combination with acetyl-L-carnitine, may increase sperm motility in males with infertility, leading to a greater likelihood of pregnancy in female partners.\nAlthough some clinical research has yielded conflicting results (58209, 58588, 59020, 90627, 111861), most clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 1-3 grams daily in divided doses for up to 24 weeks, with or without acetyl-L-carnitine 1 gram daily, increases sperm count and motility, and improves sperm morphology, in males with infertility of various etiologies (12352, 58167, 58182, 58194, 58334, 58469, 58831, 58849, 59129, 59189)(59190, 101560, 107394, 111861, 111459, 111888, 111890). However, it is unclear if taking L-carnitine increases the odds of pregnancy. One meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows that taking L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine in combination increases the odds of pregnancy by 3.7-fold over placebo. However most clinical research investigating the effect of L-carnitine alone or with acetyl L-carnitine on pregnancy rates disagrees (12352, 58182, 101560, 111861, 111459, 111888). The number of studies investigating the effect of L-carnitine alone or with acetyl-L-carnitine on pregnancy rate is small and the duration of supplementation may be inadequate.\n\nTaking L-carnitine 1 gram and acetyl-L-carnitine 0.5 grams twice daily after taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 2 months seems to increase sperm count and motility in males with abacterial prostatovesiculoepididymitis, an inflammation of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and epididymis (9791).\n\nSome studies have also evaluated L-carnitine in combination with other ingredients. One clinical trial in males with asthenospermia shows that taking L-carnitine 150 mg, acetyl-L-carnitine 50 mg, L-arginine 1660 mg, and Panax ginseng 200 mg daily for 3 months increases sperm motility and sexual satisfaction when compared with no treatment (32189). Another small clinical trial shows that taking this combination along with prulifloxacin 600 mg daily for 6 months improves sperm concentration and motility when compared with prulifloxacin alone in patients with chronic prostatitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis infection (59006). Other small and preliminary clinical studies have investigated the effects of a specific combination product providing L-carnitine 1 gram twice daily for 6 months, along with acetyl-L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, selenium, zinc, vitamin C, folic acid, vitamin B12, and citric acid (Proxeed Plus). Taking this combination product has been shown to improve measures of sperm quality such as sperm count, sperm concentration, total motility, and progressive motility when compared to baseline. The effect on sperm volume and morphology is unclear. Most research has been conducted in patients with oligoasthenozoospermia, although some benefit has also been shown in patients with varicocele-related infertility, especially those with more severe varicocele (102017, 107395, 111296). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator group. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nThe effect of L-carnitine in combination with other ingredients on pregnancy rate has also been examined. One meta-analysis of moderate-quality clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine in combination with micronutrients increases the odds of pregnancy by 3.5-fold over placebo or no treatment (111888).\nless\nMyocarditis. Oral DL-carnitine may prevent myocarditis in children with diphtheria.\nMyocarditis is a complication of diphtheria. Clinical research in children with diphtheria shows that taking DL-carnitine 100 mg/kg daily for 4 days reduces the risk of myocarditis and mortality when compared with no treatment (3620, 3621).\nless\nValproic acid-induced toxicities. Although more well-designed research is needed to confirm these findings, oral and intravenous L-carnitine may improve neurologic and hepatic function and reduce ammonia levels in patients with these valproic acid-induced toxicities.\nValproic acid-induced toxicities are often associated with low plasma and tissue levels of L-carnitine. Preliminary clinical research and case reports in patients on valproic acid therapy who have neurologic or hepatic deterioration or hyperammonemia show that taking L-carnitine 50-100 mg/kg daily in divided doses or administering L-carnitine 150-500 mg/kg daily via intravenous infusion seems to improve neurologic and hepatic function and bring plasma ammonia levels within normal limits (1438, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, 4523, 5798, 5799, 95068). There is also some preliminary evidence that intravenous L-carnitine can prevent the development of severe valproic acid-induced hepatotoxicity when given to patients being treated for overdose and accidental ingestion of valproic acid (1438, 4528, 5798, 5799), especially if treatment is initiated early (4528). Despite these results, most evidence consists of anecdotal individuals or small case series. A more recent retrospective cohort study suggests that treatment with an L-carnitine dosing regimen consisting of a 100 mg/kg intravenous loading dose followed by up to 3 grams daily in divided doses for 3 days or until ICU discharge does not enhance valproic acid elimination or prevent organ dysfunction when compared with patients not treated with L-carnitine (111869). Also, taking L-carnitine does not appear to reduce valproic acid-associated weight gain (58295). Well-designed clinical trials are still needed to determine the role of L-carnitine in the treatment or prevention of valproic acid toxicities.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Topical L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with mild-to-moderate acne shows that applying a proprietary formulation containing L-carnitine, licochalcone, and 1,2-decanediol to the face twice daily for 8 weeks reduces the number of acne lesions and pustules and improves quality of life when compared to baseline. However, the improvements do not appear to be significant when compared with placebo (26493).\nless\nAge-related fatigue. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve physical and mental fatigue associated with aging.\nTwo small clinical trials in elderly patients experiencing fatigue after slight physical activity shows that taking L-carnitine 2-4 grams daily for 1-6 months improves physical and mental fatigue, increases muscle mass, and decreases fat mass when compared with placebo (16109, 16111).\nless\nAluminum phosphide poisoning. It is unclear if intravenous L-carnitine is beneficial in people with aluminum phosphide poisoning.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in patients with aluminum phosphide poisoning shows that intravenous L-carnitine does not reduce the odds of mortality when compared with control groups receiving routine treatments only (111892). However, only 2 studies were included in the analysis and both studies may have been underpowered to detect differences.\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Oral L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking L-carnitine tartrate 3.73 grams, in combination with serine, nicotinamide riboside, and N-acetyl cysteine, daily for 28 days and then twice daily for 56 days does not improve cognitive function when compared with taking placebo. However, in patients with the most severe symptoms, there was some modest improvement (110623). This study may have been underpowered to detect differences. Also, the effect of L-carnitine alone is unclear.\nless\nAndrogenic alopecia. It is unclear if topical L-carnitine is beneficial in people with androgenic alopecia.\nOne small clinical trial in individuals with androgenic alopecia shows that applying topical L-carnitine 2% solution to the scalp twice daily for 6 months significantly increases the number of terminal hair shafts on the scalp when compared with placebo (58390).\nless\nAnorexia nervosa. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for anorexia nervosa, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose.\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity. Oral and intravenous L-carnitine have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with breast cancer undergoing doxorubicin treatment shows that taking a combination of L-carnitine and vitamin E over 4 21-day treatment cycles decreases the proportion of patients with cardiac events by 24.2% when compared with chemotherapy treatment only. There were also modest beneficial effects on some enzyme measures of cardiac health. Patients received L-carnitine 3 grams intravenously on the first day of each cycle followed by an oral intake of 300 mg 4 times daily for the remaining 20 days. Vitamin E 1800 mg daily was taken orally in 3 divided doses (111891).\nless\nArrhythmia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may reduce the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with premature ventricular contractions.\nSmall clinical trials in patients with premature ventricular contractions show that taking L-carnitine 2 grams twice daily for 45 weeks or 2 grams three times daily for 2 weeks might reduce the incidence of arrhythmias when compared to baseline (59043, 59120, 59143).\nless\nAsthenopia (eye strain). Oral L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in videoterminal users with computer vision syndrome and without dry eye shows that taking a product containing L-carnitine 50 mg, along with zinc and extracts of elderberry, black currant, and eleuthero root (Meramirt CM) daily for 1 month modestly reduces severity of eye strain and sensitivity when compared with not taking this product (111295). It is unclear if these findings are due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAthletic performance. Oral L-carnitine has been evaluated for its effect on athletic performance in several small and short-term clinical studies, with mixed results.\nMaximal exercise in trained athletes has been associated with a decrease in plasma L-carnitine levels (3648, 58583). Theoretically, restoring these levels with L-carnitine supplementation might have beneficial effects. However, clinical studies examining the use of L-carnitine for athletic performance have reported conflicting results. Some clinical studies show that taking L-carnitine 2 grams, either before exercise or daily for up to 6 weeks, enhances athletic performance and endurance and reduces post-exercise muscle pain in male athletes and healthy untrained males (58450, 59182, 59185), but other studies do not support these findings (1947, 59128, 59134). Additionally, although some studies show that taking L-carnitine 1-2 grams or 40 mg/kg before exercise or 4 grams daily for 2 weeks can decrease lactate accumulation and increase oxygen uptake, power output, and time to anabolic threshold during exercise (3649, 3650, 59061, 59184, 59186), other studies show no improvement in these outcomes (58471, 58775, 59033, 59045, 59069, 59128). These discrepancies may be related to the small study sizes, short treatment durations, and variable dosing regimens.\nless\nAtrial fibrillation. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing aortic valve surgery.\nA very small clinical study in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement or valve-sparing aortic root replacement shows that receiving oral L-carnitine (L-Cartin FF, Otsuka Pharmaceutical) 1 gram three times daily, beginning 2 days prior to surgery and continuing for 7 days after surgery, is associated with a postoperative atrial fibrillation rate of 20%, compared with a rate of 60% in a historical age-matched control group not receiving L-carnitine (107408).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in children with ADHD.\nOne small crossover trial in children with ADHD shows that taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg twice daily for 6 months improves parent and teacher assessments of behavior when compared with placebo (58166).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve some symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.\nSmall clinical trials in children 3-16 years of age with autism spectrum disorder show that taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg daily for 8 to 12 weeks modestly improves overall symptoms of autism, especially lethargy, social isolation, hyperactivity, and irritability, when compared with taking placebo. However, there is inconsistency between studies with respect to rating scales used and specific endpoints showing improvement. In one study, children remained on any pre-existing medications; in the other two, all children were also taking risperidone (58981, 111887, 111900).\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients in Iran with BPH shows that taking L-carnitine 1000 mg plus coenzyme Q10 daily in addition to finasteride 5 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly improves subjective assessment of sexual function when compared with placebo plus finasteride. There was no effect on prostate symptoms, prostate specific antigen levels, or quality of life (113226). It is unclear if these effects are due to L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, or the combination.\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve symptoms and reduce complications of beta-thalassemia minor, intermedia, and major.\nSeveral small clinical trials in children with beta-thalassemia major show that taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg daily for 3-6 months might reduce pulmonary artery systolic pressure, increase cardiac output during exercise, and improve progression to puberty (58294, 58502, 58556). Clinical research in adults with beta-thalassemia intermedia shows that taking L-carnitine with hydroxyurea appears to increase hemoglobin and hematocrit and reduce left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, a measure of pulmonary hypertension (58679). In patients with beta-thalassemia major or intermedia aged 6 years and up, taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg daily for 6 months normalized left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy in 30% and 37% of patients, respectively, compared with only 10% in those taking placebo. Cardiac output was also improved, but there were no changes in blood parameters (101565). Clinical research in children with beta-thalassemia minor shows that taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg daily, with or without folic acid 1 mg daily, for 3 months appears to reduce bone pain by 84% to 87% and increase the number of climbable stairs 3.1- to 5.2-fold when compared with baseline (90631).\nless\nCachexia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve body composition and quality of life in patients with cancer-related cachexia.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with cancer-related cachexia shows that taking L-carnitine 4 grams daily for 12 weeks increases body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo (59029). Other research shows that taking L-carnitine 4 grams daily with megestrol acetate, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and thalidomide for 5 months is more effective than any single product alone for increasing lean body mass in patients with cancer-related cachexia (23437). Additionally, taking L-carnitine 4 grams daily with megestrol acetate, celecoxib, and antioxidants for 4 months appears more effective than megestrol acetate alone for improving lean body mass, fatigue, and quality of life in these patients (59012).\nless\nCancer-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for improving fatigue in patients with advanced cancer.\nSome cancer patients have low blood levels of L-carnitine, which may reduce energy production and lead to fatigue. Some small clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer show that taking L-carnitine 3-4 grams daily for 7 days significantly improves some measures of fatigue when compared to baseline (16106, 16110). However, other higher quality clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 2-4 grams daily for 4-12 weeks is no more effective than placebo for improving fatigue in advanced cancer patients (26498, 58523, 59029).\nless\nCeliac disease. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with celiac disease.\nSome research shows that L-carnitine blood levels are low in patients with celiac disease. One small clinical trial in patients with celiac disease shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 6 months lowers some measures of fatigue when compared with placebo. However, L-carnitine does not significantly improve measures of depression or quality of life in these patients (16105).\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with fatigue due to sunitinib therapy.\nA small clinical study in adults with renal cell carcinoma who are experiencing fatigue associated with sunitinib treatment shows that taking L-carnitine 1500 mg daily for 2 weeks modestly improves fatigue severity when compared to baseline (100352). The validity of this finding is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with CFS.\nOne small clinical study in adults with CFS shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram three times daily for 2 months can improve some symptoms of CFS when compared to baseline (3630). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with COPD.\nOne small clinical study in adults with moderate to severe COPD shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 6 weeks improves exercise performance and walking tolerance when compared with placebo (58213).\nless\nCirrhosis. Preliminary research suggests that oral L-carnitine may be beneficial in patients with cirrhosis.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with cirrhosis who are receiving branched-chain amino acids supplements to improve nutritional status shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram orally daily for 6 months, in addition to increasing exercise by 2000 steps per day, does not improve muscle volume, handgrip strength, or leg strength, but does reduce complaints of muscle cramping, when compared to baseline (102124). Another small, uncontrolled clinical trial in patients with cirrhosis shows that taking L-carnitine 1800 mg daily for 6 months does not improve Child-Pugh scores, but may improve quality of life, when compared to baseline (104177). The validity of these studies is limited by the lack of comparator groups. The effect of L-carnitine has also been examined retrospectively in patients with cirrhosis. One retrospective study in matched patients that had been admitted to hospital for cirrhosis suggests that taking L-carnitine for more than 30 days is associated with an increase in survival length by about 21 months compared with not taking L-carnitine. Overall, L-carnitine use was also associated with a 36% to 48% increase in the proportion of patients surviving 1-5 years, with the greatest effect in patients with modest to severe liver dysfunction. The median dose of L-carnitine was 1000 mg daily for at least 6 months is associated with a reduced loss of skeletal muscle compared with not taking L-carnitine (111860). The validity of these studies is limited by their retrospective design.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for improving cognitive function in healthy individuals.\nLow-quality clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 500 mg as a single dose or 250 mg twice daily for 3 days does not improve cognitive function or memory in otherwise healthy young adults when compared with placebo (58176, 95070).\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with CHD.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with CHD shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams prior to exercise does not improve endurance when compared with placebo (58196). Another small clinical trial in patients with CHD shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks does not improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, or apolipoprotein-B when compared with placebo; however, it does appear to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A-1 levels in these patients (95071).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for COVID-19 prevention or treatment.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram 3 times daily for 5 days does not reduce the incidence of fever or cough when compared with standard treatments only. However, all patients taking L-carnitine survived compared with 86% of those given standard treatment only. Also, there were improvements in oxygen saturation and inflammatory measures (111874). Other clinical research in patients with confirmed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 shows that taking L-carnitine tartrate (Carnipure) 1 gram 3 times daily for 21 days does not prevent the development of severe lung symptoms when compared with taking placebo. However, in a sub-group of patients, lung lesion improvement was significantly better between days 7 and 14. In adults without COVID-19 but living with someone with confirmed disease, taking this product does not prevent COVID-19 when compared with taking placebo. However, the total number of confirmed illnesses in the population was low (111898).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral or nasogastric L-carnitine is beneficial for critical illness.\nOne small clinical trial in critically ill patients in the ICU shows that receiving L-carnitine (BSK, Zist Takhmir Co, Tehran-Iran) 3 grams daily via a nasogastric tube for 7 days modestly improves disease severity, organ function, inflammatory and other laboratory measures when compared with receiving placebo. Also, mortality rate was reduced by approximately 50%. There was no effect on the duration of hospital or ICU stay (111883, 111884). However, another small clinical trial in critically ill patients following an acute ischemic stroke shows that oral or nasogastric L-carnitine tartrate 500 mg every 8 hours for 6 days does not affect the duration of mechanical ventilation or hospital or ICU stay, the severity of illness, or 28-day mortality rates, when compared with taking placebo. There was a modest beneficial effect on insulin resistance (111881). This study was small and may have been underpowered to detect differences.\nless\nDiabetes. Oral L-carnitine may improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes, but it is unclear if these improvements are clinically meaningful. It is also unclear if L-carnitine can improve lipid profiles or weight loss in these patients.\nWhile individual study results are mixed (58169, 58189, 58514, 58793, 90632, 96922, 101561), meta-analyses of available clinical research in mixed populations shows that taking L-carnitine 200 mg to 4 grams daily reduces fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels, and possibly insulin, and improves insulin resistance, when compared with taking placebo or a control diet, although the clinical significance of these improvements is unclear (102018, 111875, 111886). One meta-analysis shows that these benefits are generally specific to patients with high levels of fasting glucose, diabetes, or obesity, as well as studies investigating L-carnitine in doses of at least 2 grams daily for 12 weeks. However, a small number of studies included in this analysis investigated the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine (111875). Other research in obese patients with type 2 diabetes shows that, when taken with orlistat or sibutramine, L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 12 months decreases body weight and body mass index and improves glycemic control when compared with orlistat or sibutramine alone (58778, 58830, 58882). The effect of L-carnitine on lipids in people with diabetes is unclear. Some studies show significant reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and/or lipoprotein(a) (58554, 58647, 58649, 90632, 101561, 107397), while other studies show no improvement in lipid profiles (58169, 58189).\nless\nDilated cardiomyopathy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve ejection fraction in children with dilated cardiomyopathy and adults with ischemic cardiomyopathy.\nPrimary L-carnitine deficiency is a common cause of pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology have been shown to have low cardiac levels of L-carnitine (59196, 100351). Due to these findings, L-carnitine has been evaluated for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy in children and adults, but the small sizes of these studies and methodological limitations limit the reliability of the results.\n\nOne small clinical study in children under 13 years of age with dilated cardiomyopathy shows that taking L-carnitine 50-100 mg/kg daily for 1 year in conjunction with standard care improves ejection fraction and reduces left atrial and ventricular diameters when compared with placebo and standard care (100351). The results of this study are limited by the small sample size, unclear etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, and potential bias. Another small clinical study in children under 5 years of age with dilated cardiomyopathy and low serum levels of L-carnitine shows that taking L-carnitine 100 mg/kg daily for 3 months improves left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification when compared with baseline (59196). Further research is needed to clarify whether L-carnitine is beneficial for most children with dilated cardiomyopathy, or only those with carnitine deficiency.\n\nL-carnitine has also been evaluated in older adults. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in mostly older adults with dilated cardiomyopathy shows that addition of intravenous L-carnitine, alone or followed by oral L-carnitine, 1-6 grams daily to conventional therapy for a total of 10-28 days is associated with a 28% increased likelihood of overall efficacy, with improvements observed in both LVEF and cardiac output, when compared with conventional therapy alone (107405). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, potential publication bias, and unclear reporting. A small individual clinical study in older adults with ischemic cardiomyopathy shows that taking oral L-carnitine daily for 2 months improves LVEF when compared with baseline (58150). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDry eye. Topical L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nEvidence suggests that chronic use of eye drops containing benzalkonium chloride can cause tear film instability and lead to dry eye (90921). One small clinical trial in patients with glaucoma using eye drops containing benzalkonium chloride shows that using additional eye drops containing L-carnitine (1.017%), eledoisin (0.04%), taurine (0.49%), sodium hyaluronate (0.20 grams/100 mL), and vitamin E acetate (0.20 grams/100 mL) (Carnidrop Plus, Sigma-Tau) three times daily for 15 days reduces dry eye symptoms by approximately 50% when compared to baseline (90625). It is unclear if these findings are due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nEndometriosis. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for endometriosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose.\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Oral L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized, open-label clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Icarifil, Anvest Health S.p.A) containing L-carnitine 500 mg, L-citrulline, Panax ginseng, tribulus, and other ingredients daily for 3 months improves patient-reported erectile function when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking the supplement with tadalafil improves some, but not all, patient-reported assessments of erectile function when compared with taking tadalafil alone (114989). It is unclear if this effect is due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the interpretation of these results is limited by poor methodology, including the use of per-protocol analysis and lack of a placebo group.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine tartrate is beneficial for exercise recovery.\nA small clinical study in healthy males and females participating in moderate physical activity at least 3 days weekly shows that taking a specific product (Carnipure, Lonza Consumer Health, Inc.) providing elemental L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 5 weeks improves perceived recovery and soreness as well as serum creatine kinase levels by 33% and 28%, respectively, when compared with placebo (107398).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may slightly reduce exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nEvidence from mostly small clinical trials, when considered alone or combined via meta-analysis, shows that taking L-carnitine 1-3 grams daily for around 3 weeks modestly reduces exercise-induced muscle soreness, especially in the period of 24-48 hours after exercise. Benefits may last up to 96 hours post-exercise. Levels of creatinine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and myoglobin also appear to improve with L-carnitine supplementation, reflecting a reduction in muscle damage (58326, 58709, 59148, 101567).\nless\nHepatic encephalopathy. Oral or intravenous L-carnitine may improve biochemical markers of disease severity in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, but L-carnitine does not seem to improve clinically important outcomes such as fatigue, quality of life, or overall disease severity.\nA meta-analysis of nine studies in adults with hepatic encephalopathy shows that taking L-carnitine 1-6 grams daily orally or intravenously for up to 90 days increases albumin levels and decreases plasma levels of ammonia, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine, but does not improve fatigue or quality of life, when compared with placebo (102122). A more recent clinical trial shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 24 weeks modestly improves bilirubin levels and some measures of cognitive and liver health, but not quality of life, when compared with taking placebo (111876). Two of the clinical trials included in this analysis also show that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 60-90 days significantly improves cognitive function when compared with placebo in adults with hepatic encephalopathy (58174, 58204). Another small clinical trial in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis shows that L-carnitine improves psychometric response to the ammonia tolerance test, suggesting that L-carnitine might be useful in the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy (58872).\n\nL-carnitine has also been evaluated in combination with rifaximin. A small clinical study in patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy shows that taking oral L-carnitine 1500 mg in combination with rifaximin 1200 mg three times daily for 12 weeks has no effect on the modified portal systemic encephalopathy index when compared with rifaximin alone. L-carnitine improved blood ammonia levels at 4 weeks, but not at 8 or 12 weeks (107410).\nless\nHepatitis B. Oral L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with hepatitis B shows that taking a specific vitamin complex providing L-carnitine 2472 mg (Godex, Celltrion Pharm) in combination with entecavir 0.5 grams daily for 12 months normalizes alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in 95% and 100% of patients after 3 months and 12 months, respectively, compared to 59% and 86% of patients taking entecavir alone. However, the L-carnitine complex does not appear to improve aspartate transaminase (AST) levels or reduce hepatitis B virus titers (91724). It is unclear if these findings are due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHepatitis C. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve response to treatment and markers of liver function in patients with hepatitis C.\nTwo small clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C show that taking L-carnitine 2 grams once or twice daily along with interferon-alpha and ribavirin for 12 months modestly improves response to treatment, increases hemoglobin and red blood cell counts, reduces aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and reduces steatosis when compared with interferon-alpha and ribavirin treatment alone (58405, 59010).\nless\nHepatitis-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with hepatitis-related fatigue.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with hepatitis C who are receiving interferon-alpha treatment shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily significantly reduces fatigue when compared with interferon-alpha alone. L-carnitine appears to reduce fatigue within the first 3 months of treatment, but not after 6 months (16104).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using intravenous L-carnitine to increase CD4 counts in patients with HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for reducing systolic or diastolic blood pressure.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality clinical studies in adults, both healthy and with underlying health conditions,shows that taking oral L-carnitine 0.5 to 3 grams daily for 4 to 52 weeks does not reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when compared with control(115352). The validity of this study is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including population, dose, and outcome measurements.\nless\nHyperthyroidism. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with hyperthyroidism.\nOne small clinical trial in females with hyperthyroidism shows that taking L-carnitine 2-4 grams daily for 2-6 months seems to significantly improve symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, nervousness, tremors, and asthenia, when compared with placebo (8047).\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.\nSmall clinical studies in patients with hypertriglyceridemia show that taking L-carnitine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks does not reduce triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (59028, 59244).\nless\nHypothyroidism. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for improving fatigue in patients with hypothyroidism.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with secondary hypothyroidism shows that taking L-carnitine (Ildong Pharmaceutical Co.) 990 mg twice daily for 12 weeks in addition to adequate doses of levothyroxine does not reduce overall fatigue severity when compared with placebo. However, taking L-carnitine might improve physical and mental fatigue in patients with secondary hypothyroidism that are less than 50 years of age. L-carnitine might also improve mental fatigue in patients that underwent thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer (95069).\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for female infertility.\nOne uncontrolled clinical trial in females who had failed to conceive in previous in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles shows that taking L-carnitine (L-CAR Basic Premium; AA Project Co. ltd.) 1000 mg daily for an average of 82 days does not improve the number of retrieved oocytes or fertilization rates when compared with previous IVF cycles. However, embryo quality at days 3 and 5 of insemination was improved, resulting in an increase in the rate of transferable embryos from 60% in previous cycles to 67%, morphologically good-quality embryos from around 46% to 54%, and blastocysts from around 11% to 21%. The most evidence of benefit was seen in those taking L-carnitine for the shortest time length of 7-44 days (96933).\nless\nIntermittent claudication. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for intermittent claudication, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose.\nLiver disease. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may modestly improve some, but not all, lipid parameters in adults with liver disease.\nA meta-analysis of six small, low-quality clinical trials in patients with hepatitis C, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) shows that taking L-carnitine moderately reduces total cholesterol and slightly reduces triglyceride levels, but does not improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with control. Studies evaluating L-carnitine doses of 2 grams daily or less and study durations of 24 months or longer showed the largest effect on lipid levels (104178). Another meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in patients with hepatitis B or C, hepatic encephalopathy, NASH, or NAFLD shows that taking L-carnitine modestly reduces levels if aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (AST) when compared with taking placebo or no L-carnitine. Some of the studies included in this analysis used acetyl-L-carnitine. However, a meta-analysis of two studies investigating the effect of carnitine orotate shows that taking this compound increases the proportion of patients with normal ALT levels by 4.6 fold (111871).\nless\nLiver transplant. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients awaiting a liver transplant.\nOne small clinical trial shows that taking L-carnitine 500 mg three times daily while awaiting a liver transplant does not reduce the incidence of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) or non-function (PNF) when compared with placebo. However, survival one month after surgery was 97% in those taking L-carnitine, compared with 74% in those taking placebo (101562). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in the incidences of PGD and PNF between groups.\nless\nLow birth weight. It is unclear if oral or intravenous L-carnitine is effective for increasing body weight in preterm infants. Several small clinical studies show conflicting results.\nSeveral very small clinical trials in preterm infants receiving total parenteral nutrition show that administering L-carnitine orally at a dose of 13-60 mcmol/kg or intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg or 50-100 mcmol/kg daily can improve fat utilization and weight gain when compared with control (3633, 3634, 3635, 3636, 3637, 58902, 59097). However, other small clinical studies show that supplementation with L-carnitine does not significantly increase body weight in preterm infants (58190, 58800, 59161). The reasons for the discrepant findings are unclear, but due to small study size, some of the studies may have been underpowered to detect significant differences between groups.\nless\nLyme disease. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose.\nMalnutrition. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in children with severe malnutrition.\nA moderate-sized clinical study conducted in Bangladesh in children aged 9 to 24 months hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition shows that administering oral L-carnitine syrup 100 mg/kg daily for 15 days in addition to standard care does not improve rates of weight gain or reduce durations of hospital stays when compared with placebo (115351).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral or intravenous L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nOne very small clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome undergoing 2 days of moderate calorie restriction followed by a 5-day modified fasting period shows that intravenous L-carnitine 2 grams twice daily for 7 days increases weight loss by 1.4 kg and decreases waist circumference by 3.3 cm when compared with intravenous saline. Perceived hunger scores, physical fatigue, and insulin levels were also improved. However, there were no effects on blood pressure (90634). Other clinical research in patients with metabolic syndrome and a total carotid plaque volume of at least 50 mm3 shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 6 months does not affect the progression of carotid plaque volume when compared with taking placebo. Also, taking L-carnitine increased the progression of carotid plaque stenosis by 9.3%, as well as levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in this population (111879).\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with migraine headaches.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with migraines shows that taking L-carnitine 500 mg daily, with or without magnesium oxide, for 12 weeks does not significantly reduce migraine frequency or severity when compared with a control (59030). However, another small preliminary clinical trial in children with episodic migraines shows that taking L-carnitine 25 mg per kg twice daily for 12 weeks prophylactically is as effective as taking propranolol 1 mg/kg once daily for reducing the frequency, severity, and duration of migraine headaches (111870). These studies were small and may have been underpowered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with multiple sclerosis-related fatigue.\nSome patients with multiple sclerosis have low blood levels of L-carnitine. Additionally, immunosuppressive therapy for multiple sclerosis can cause fatigue. One small, open-label clinical trial in patients with multiple sclerosis receiving immunosuppressive therapy and with low L-carnitine levels shows that taking L-carnitine 3-6 grams daily decreases some measures of fatigue when compared with no treatment (16107).\nless\nMuscle cramps. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with muscle cramps.\nOne small, uncontrolled clinical trial in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking L-carnitine 300 mg twice daily for 4 months decreases the monthly frequency of muscle cramps from around 4 cramps per month at baseline to around 1 cramp per month after treatment. When compared with baseline, pain was also reduced by about 1 point on a 5-point scale (96922). However, the lack of a placebo control group limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if oral or intravenous L-carnitine is beneficial in patients who have experienced an MI.\nSome clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine orally or intravenously after MI reduces premature ventricular beats (58172, 59044), improves myocardial viability (59248) and left ventricular function (3628), and reduces mortality (3627, 3629, 59037). However, other studies show no change in left ventricular functioning (58148) or mortality after taking L-carnitine (3628, 58225, 90630). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear, but may be due to differences in the dosing regimens and length of follow-up. Oral L-carnitine doses have ranged from 2-4 grams daily for up to 12 months (3627, 3629, 59248). Intravenous L-carnitine has been dosed at 5 grams within the first 36 hours after an MI followed by 3 grams twice daily on days 3-7 (58172), 100 mg/kg every 12 hours for 36 hours (59044), or 9 grams daily for 5 days followed by oral L-carnitine 6 grams daily for 12 months (3628).\nless\nNarcolepsy. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with narcolepsy.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with narcolepsy shows that taking L-carnitine 340 mg in the morning and 170 mg in the evening for 8 weeks reduces dozing off time during the day by about 9 minutes when compared with placebo. However, the number of naps needed, quality of life, and sleepiness are not affected (90624).\nless\nNeonatal apnea. It is unclear if intravenous L-carnitine is beneficial for preventing neonatal apnea in premature infants.\nOne small clinical trial in premature infants shows that adding L-carnitine 30 mg/kg daily to total parenteral nutrition or oral feeds does not affect ventilator requirements or reduce the incidence of apnea when compared with placebo (58163).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in children and adults with NAFLD.\nOne small clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking L-carnitine 600 mg daily for 3 months improves markers of liver function when compared with baseline. No improvements in liver function markers were reported in patients in the control group; however, no statistical comparisons were conducted between groups (58808). A small clinical study in children aged 5-15 years with NAFLD receiving vitamin E shows that taking L-carnitine 25 mg/kg twice daily (maximum of 500 mg twice daily) for 3 months has no effect on aminotransferase concentrations or sonographic grades of fatty liver when compared with placebo (107401).\nless\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with NASH.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with NASH shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram after breakfast and 1 gram after dinner daily along with following a specific diet improves markers of liver function when compared with diet alone (58715). Another small clinical trial in patients with obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis taking simvastatin 20 mg daily and following a hypocaloric diet shows that taking L-carnitine 10 mL twice daily for 90 days modestly reduces BMI, and improves liver health, lipid, and glycemic indices, when compared with taking a product described as essential phospholipids (111893).\nless\nObesity. Oral L-carnitine seems to have a small effect on weight loss in overweight or obese individuals when taken for up to 6 months, but some conflicting results exist. Doses of 2 grams daily seem to offer the most benefit.\nMeta-analyses of clinical trials show that taking L-carnitine 250 mg to 4 grams daily reduces weight and body mass index (BMI) by a small amount when compared with a control group not taking L-carnitine (95074, 101563, 101564). Subgroup analyses show that L-carnitine only reduces BMI and weight in overweight or obese patients. Taking L-carnitine did not affect weight or BMI in patients with a BMI of up to 25 kg/m2 or in patients undergoing hemodialysis (101563, 101564). Another subgroup analysis shows that the largest benefit occurs at a dose of 2 grams daily (101564). In patients with obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis taking simvastatin 20 mg daily and following a hypocaloric diet, one clinical trial shows that taking L-carnitine 10 mL twice daily for 90 days modestly reduces BMI, and improves liver health, lipid, and glycemic indices, when compared with taking a product described as essential phospholipids (111893). However, conflicting results exist. One subgroup analysis in overweight or obese individuals shows that there is no effect on BMI when L-carnitine is taken for 24 weeks or more (101563). One meta-analysis of two small clinical trials in patients with overweight or obesity shows that taking L-carnitine is no more effective than lifestyle modification for reducing body weight (111866). Also, some clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine does not reduce body weight in obese females. Doses used in these studies include L-carnitine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks or 2 grams twice daily for 8 weeks along with exercise (58151, 111872).\n\nThe effect of L-carnitine on cardiovascular risk has also been examined in patients with obesity. One small clinical trial shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces the lipid accumulation index, based on waist circumference and blood triglyceride levels, when compared with taking placebo. However, there was no effect on other cardiovascular risk indices based on ratios of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and/or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (111872).\n\nL-carnitine has also been evaluated in combination with weight loss medications. Clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily along with orlistat 360 mg daily or sibutramine 10 mg daily for 1 year decreases body weight and BMI when compared with orlistat or sibutramine alone in obese adults with type 2 diabetes (58778, 58830, 58882).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with knee osteoarthritis.\nA small clinical study in females with knee osteoarthritis and overweight or obesity who are on a low-calorie diet shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks does not improve pain, stiffness, or physical function when compared with placebo (107403).\nless\nPemphigus. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for glucocorticoid-induced muscle wasting in patients with pemphigus, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose.\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with PAD.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with PAD shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams twice daily for 3 weeks may improve walking distances in people with PAD (3631). However, another small clinical trial in patients with PAD or coronary heart disease shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams two hours before exercise does not improve endurance (58196). Also, adding L-carnitine 1 gram twice daily to cilostazol therapy for 180 days does not appear to confer additional benefit in this patient population (59023).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for improving pregnancy rates or cardiovascular risk in people with PCOS. The effect of L-carnitine on body composition has promising results.\nClinical research shows that adding L-carnitine 3 grams daily for 3 months to standard clomiphene plus metformin therapy improves menstrual regularity by 20%, ovulation rate by 24%, and pregnancy rate by 21% when compared with placebo (102123). Preliminary clinical research in patients with PCOS who are resistant to both clomiphene and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams twice daily from day 3 of clomiphene treatment until HCG injection results in the presence of a dominant follicle in 64% of cycles and pregnancy in 20% of cycles (96936).\n\nHowever, L-carnitine may not be beneficial in combination with assisted reproductive technology (ART), including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Two small clinical studies in patients with PCOS receiving ART in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol shows that adding L-carnitine 3000 mg daily starting on the second day of menstruation and continuing until the day of oocyte triggering or embryo transfer does not improve rates of oocyte maturity or retrieval, implantation, or pregnancy when compared with control (107409, 115353).\n\nThe effect of L-carnitine has also been examined on anthropometric and cardiovascular risk indices in patients with PCOS. One small clinical study shows that taking L-carnitine 250 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight by 2.8 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 1.2 kg/m2, waist circumference by 1.7 cm, and hip circumference by 2.2 cm when compared with placebo (96935). A meta-analysis of this and other small studies also shows that L-carnitine modestly reduces BMI when compared with placebo in patients with PCOS (111873). Although several studies also show improvements in markers of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, most research does not support beneficial effects on lipid levels, cardiovascular risk, or liver fat content (96935, 107402, 107404, 115353).\nless\nRett syndrome. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with Rett syndrome.\nTwo small clinical studies in children with Rett syndrome show that taking L-carnitine 100 mg/kg daily in two or three divided doses for up to 6 months modestly improves well-being, motor skills, sleep efficiency, and communication skills when compared with control or placebo (1433, 58161).\nless\nSarcopenia. Oral L-carnitine may be beneficial for preventing sarcopenia in adults over 75 years of age, but not in healthy older females.\nOne small clinical trial in healthy, active, older females aged 65-70 years shows that taking L-carnitine, as L-carnitine-l-tartrate 1500 mg, daily for 24 weeks does not improve muscle strength or muscle mass when compared with placebo (96930). An additional preliminary clinical trial in females aged 60-75 years taking part in a twice weekly resistance exercise program shows that taking L-carnitine tartrate 1 gram daily with L-leucine 3 grams daily for 24 weeks does not improve muscle strength or volume when compared with taking L-leucine 4 grams daily or no supplementation (111880). These studies were small and may have been underpowered to detect differences. In contrast, in weaker adults 75 years of age and older, taking L-carnitine 2-4 grams daily for 1-6 months increases muscle mass by approximately 2-4 kg when compared with placebo (16109, 16111).\nless\nSepsis. Small clinical studies suggest that intravenous L-carnitine may not reduce mortality in patients with sepsis, although patients with more severe sepsis may see some benefit.\nMeta-analyses of generally low-quality small clinical trials in patients with sepsis shows that intravenous administration of L-carnitine, 2-6 grams as a bolus followed by a 4-12 gram infusion, does not reduce the risk of 28-day or 1-year mortality when compared with placebo (104180, 111868). However, in a subgroup analysis of patients with more severe sepsis, classified as those with a sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) of greater than 12, the risk of 1-year mortality was reduced by 32% when compared with placebo (104180).\nless\nSpinal muscular atrophy. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for spinal muscular atrophy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose.\nToxin-induced liver damage. Small clinical studies have evaluated oral and intravenous L-carnitine for the management of liver damage caused by different classes of drugs, including antimycobacterial antibiotics and asparaginase-based agents, with promising results.\nThe antimycobacterial antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis, including isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide, have been associated with hepatotoxicity (90922). Clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams in two divided doses daily for 4 weeks along with a standard treatment regimen for tuberculosis reduces the percentage of treatment-naïve patients with drug-induced hepatotoxicity by almost half when compared with placebo (26499).\n\nThe asparaginase-based medications have also been associated with hepatotoxicity. Two case series of children with hyperbilirubinemia caused by treatment with L-asparaginase or pegaspargase show that administering intravenous L-carnitine 50-100 mg/kg daily improves bilirubin levels (100353, 100354). One case series also suggests that taking oral L-carnitine 50-100 mg/kg daily can help to prevent hyperbilirubinemia in patients with a history of asparaginase-induced hepatotoxicity (100353).\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for TBI, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose.\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in children with UTIs.\nOne small clinical trial in children 6 months to 10 years of age shows that taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg daily as a syrup along with antibiotics for 7 days prevents renal scarring associated with acute pyelonephritis. Kidney damage was resolved in 50% of children taking L-carnitine, compared with 13% of children taking placebo. There were no differences in urine cultures between groups (101568).\nless\nVenous leg ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for venous leg ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose.\nTheophylline-induced cardiac toxicity. It is unclear if intravenous L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with theophylline-induced cardiac toxicity.\nOne small clinical trial shows that intravenous administration of L-carnitine 100 mg/kg over 30-60 minutes followed by 50 mg/kg every 8 hours along with intravenous propranolol within 24 hours of theophylline intoxication improves symptoms associated with theophylline-induced cardiac toxicity when given along with standard treatment. This combination led to greater improvements than either agent used alone. These included improvements in serum theophylline levels, heart rate, arrhythmia, mean arterial pressure, and duration of hospital stay. When L-carnitine was used without propranolol, only respiratory rate and theophylline levels over 24 hours were improved to a greater extent than with standard treatment alone (101566).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate L-carnitine for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nL-carnitine is most commonly used at a dose of 2 grams daily. Doses ranging from 1-4 grams daily, most often taken in divided doses, have been used for up to 1 year. Doses of 6 grams or 50-100 mg/kg daily have been used for up to 6 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nIntravenous:\nDosing of intravenous L-carnitine varies depending on the condition being treated.

Also, L-carnitine has been administered as tablets or capsules in other clinical research (58176, 58554). Specific tablets containing L-carnitine 330 mg/tablet (Carnitor, Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals) or oral solutions containing L-carnitine 1 gram per 10 mL (Carnitor or Carnitor SF, Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals) have been approved by the FDA to treat primary carnitine deficiency or secondary carnitine deficiency due to an inborn error of metabolism. The oral solution Carnitor SF is sugar-free (3616).\n\nIntravenous L-carnitine solutions have also been used in some clinical research (58472, 59059, 101566). A specific intravenous solution containing L-carnitine 1 gram per 5 mL (Carnitor, Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals) has been approved by the FDA to treat primary carnitine deficiency, to treat secondary carnitine deficiency due to an inborn error of metabolism, or to treat or prevent carnitine deficiency in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis (3616).\n\nFormulations containing D,L-carnitine have been used in some clinical trials (3620, 3621). However, there is concern about using formulations containing D-carnitine. This form of carnitine can act as a competitive inhibitor of L-carnitine and cause symptoms of L-carnitine deficiency (1946).",

Adefovir was formerly used at doses of 125-500 mg daily, and was associated with significant dose- and duration-related decreases in blood carnitine. After 12 weeks of therapy with 125-250 mg daily, decreases of 42% to 62% were seen (15502); while 500 mg daily was associated with a 66% decrease in L-carnitine after 2 weeks (15503). Some studies used a supplement of L-carnitine 500 mg daily during adefovir therapy (15501, 15504). Adefovir is now used at a lower dose of 10 mg daily for treatment of hepatitis B.

Some studies have found reduced levels in some patients on the drug (1911, 4528, 12758), while others have found no effect (1913, 4526, 15505). Routine L-carnitine supplementation is not necessary. Preliminary data in patients treated with the related drug oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) suggest that it does not affect L-carnitine levels (15505).\nless\nCEFDITOREN PIVOXIL (Spectracef)\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nL-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking cefditoren pivoxil.\nCefditoren pivoxil is a prodrug which is converted to cefditoren and pivalate in the body. Pivalate combines with L-carnitine and is excreted in the urine, which increases L-carnitine losses from the body (12759). Short courses of cefditoren can decrease blood concentrations of L-carnitine, but tissue levels are unlikely to be affected. Treatment for 1-2 months may cause a decrease in muscle L-carnitine, and treatment for 6 months or longer may cause symptoms of L-carnitine deficiency (12759). Routine L-carnitine supplementation is not necessary unless therapy is prolonged or the patient has other factors contributing to low L-carnitine stores.\nless\nCISPLATIN (Platinol-AQ)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nL-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking cisplatin.\nIncreased urinary losses of L-carnitine can occur during cisplatin therapy. Cisplatin might increase L-carnitine mobilization due to tissue injury, and reduced renal tubular reabsorption due to renal injury. L-carnitine deficiency is unlikely in people who can maintain adequate dietary intake (3642).\nless\nIFOSFAMIDE (Ifex)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nL-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking ifosfamide.\nIncreased urinary losses of carnitine can occur during ifosfamide therapy (3641). This might be due to binding of L-carnitine with a metabolite of ifosfamide (3641, 11558). The clinical significance of this finding and the role of L-carnitine supplements in people treated with ifosfamide are unknown.\nless\nISOTRETINOIN (Accutane)\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking isotretinoin.\nReduced carnitine blood levels have been reported with the use of isotretinoin, sometimes with symptoms of carnitine deficiency, such as myalgia and muscle stiffness (3619).

Valproic acid interferes with L-carnitine biosynthesis in the liver, and formation of a valproylcarnitine ester which is excreted in the urine, reducing tubular reabsorption of free carnitine (4528, 4529, 5798, 15508). Reduced L-carnitine levels are not clinically significant in most people taking valproic acid. However, some patients may be at increased risk for L-carnitine deficiency with valproic acid, and this may contribute to the development of hyperammonemia and hepatotoxicity associated with the drug (1916, 1917, 5798). Risk factors for symptomatic L-carnitine deficiency with valproic acid include age less than 2 years, severe neurological problems including mental retardation, taking multiple antiepileptic drugs, poor nutrition, and use of the ketogenic diet (4528, 5798, 9612). Some experts recommend L-carnitine supplements for people with these risk factors who need to take valproic acid (4523, 4526, 4528, 4529, 5798). However, carnitine supplements aren't necessary for most people taking valproic acid who are otherwise healthy and consuming a diet adequate in L-carnitine (9612, 15507).\nless\nZIDOVUDINE (Retrovir)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nTheoretically, L-carnitine levels may be reduced in patients taking zidovudine.\nLow L-carnitine blood levels are found in some people with HIV infection. Zidovudine seems to exacerbate this, and can also lower muscle carnitine levels, which is linked to symptoms of myopathy (3617, 3618, 11551). Zidovudine interferes with mitochondrial transport of L-carnitine into muscle cells (3617, 9885). In vitro data suggest L-carnitine supplements might improve functioning of muscle cells affected by zidovudine (3617, 9885), but there isn't enough evidence to recommend routine use of L-carnitine supplements for patients taking zidovudine.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with L-carnitine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nDietary L-carnitine appears to be absorbed by active and passive transfer across enterocyte membranes. Bioavailability from a meal (54% to 87%) appears to be higher than that from a supplement (5% to 18%) (1933, 12744, 12756, 58186, 59067, 59119). In premature neonates, enteral and parenteral carnitine are absorbed equally (58276). Enteral L-carnitine is reported to have a bioavailability of approximately 15% (95068). Mucosal absorption of L-carnitine is saturated at approximately 2 grams per dose (95070).\nDistribution\nCarnitine appears to be distributed into extracellular water at first; tissue entry is slow with complex kinetics (1933). Distribution is mainly in muscle but the carnitine in other tissues, such as liver and kidney, has a rapid turnover (12744, 12756). Maximum concentrations in blood are reached roughly 3.5 hours after an oral dose (95070).\nMetabolism\nFollowing a single dose of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine are formed although maximal plasma levels were lower than for carnitine itself (58576). Unabsorbed L-carnitine is metabolized by microorganisms in the large intestine to trimethylamine N-oxide in animals (12744, 90635).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of oral L-carnitine is roughly 15 hours (95070). Carnitine is eliminated almost completely in the urine (approximately 20 mcM daily) or the dialysate, and is normally reabsorbed in the kidney proximal tubule (1933, 3642, 95070).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nL-carnitine is naturally found in the body. Endogenous carnitines exist as a \"carnitine pool\" consisting of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, and several other acyl-carnitine esters. Intracellular enzymes and cell membrane transporters can rapidly interconvert the carnitines to the needed form and transport them between the tissues and extracellular space. The body obtains some carnitine from the diet, primarily from red meats and dairy products. The body can also synthesize carnitines from the amino acids, lysine and methionine. The kidney aids in keeping carnitine levels stable. Normally, greater than 90% of filtered carnitine is reabsorbed. If dietary intake of carnitines decreases, carnitine reabsorption becomes even more efficient (12744). Most L-carnitine in the body is found in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The highest concentration of L-carnitine is in the epididymal fluid (12352).\n\nL-carnitine plays a key role in cellular energy production. It is essential for beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria. To enter the mitochondria, fatty acids must bind to coenzyme A, forming fatty acyl-CoA. Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules are too large to cross the internal mitochondrial membrane and rely on enzymatic transportation that requires L-carnitine. In the mitochondria, fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and L-acetyl-carnitine is excreted to begin a new transport cycle (12352). The body can convert L-carnitine to acetyl-L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine. But, no one knows whether the benefits of carnitines are interchangeable (12744).\n\nPrimary tissue deficiency of L-carnitine can arise from hepatic synthesis failure, membrane transport failure, or disorders of re-absorption by the kidney. It is characterized by low concentrations of L-carnitine in plasma, red blood cells and tissues (3616). L-carnitine deficiency can also occur due to other disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism, cirrhosis, and hypopituitarism. Carnitine deficiency most often presents with symptoms of progressive cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle weakness, and less frequently with fasting hypoglycemic coma (12748, 15508). Muscle L-carnitine deficiency has been reported in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (3640), and in people with myopathies due to zidovudine (3618) or isotretinoin (3619). Increased urinary losses of L-carnitine have been reported with ifosfamide and cisplatin therapy (3641, 3642).\n\nLow serum L-carnitine levels can occur in patients with a variety of conditions including those taking valproic acid therapy (1910, 1911, 1912, 1913, 4526, 4528), in pregnant women (3643), those with HIV/AIDS (3617), in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) (58535), in those with asthma (58574), and in patients with hyperthyroidism (8047). The relationship between serum and tissue L-carnitine levels is not fully understood, and it is not known whether or not low serum levels necessarily lead to symptomatic deficiency (4528, 4529, 5798). Low L-carnitine levels have also been found in patients with fatigue related to multiple sclerosis, celiac disease, and cancer (16105, 16106, 16107). Some research has also found low L-carnitine levels in people with chronic fatigue syndrome (3630); however, other research has not found low L-carnitine levels in these patients (16108).\n\nSymptomatic deficiency is unlikely to arise from insufficient dietary intake since the body is usually able to synthesize adequate quantities. However, preterm neonates have a reduced capacity to synthesize L-carnitine and they may become deficient, especially if receiving total parenteral nutrition without L-carnitine supplements (3633, 59106, 59107). Breast milk and some formulas contain L-carnitine. Those that do not generally do not induce symptomatic deficiencies in healthy full-term infants unless a metabolic disorder is also present, although utilization of fats may be impaired (3644, 59083, 59108).\n\nIn people with angina, a reduction in tissue L-carnitine levels has been observed during myocardial ischemia. L-carnitine can be decreased by as much as 50% in failing myocardium (8048). Decreased L-carnitine levels have also been found in persons with beta-thalassemia (58269) and polycystic ovary syndrome (58467). In patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis, serum levels of L-carnitine and its esters are sometimes increased, possibly due to increased L-carnitine biosynthesis (1931, 1948).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nBy decreasing the formation of reactive oxygen species, L-carnitine can inhibit the nuclear factor-kappa beta pathway, leading to anti-inflammatory effects. Due to the increased levels of oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), there is interest in using L-carnitine in CAD (95071). In clinical research, oral supplementation with L-carnitine for at least 10-12 weeks was associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (102125, 107400, 107403, 111899). Mechanisms by which L-carnitine could reduce inflammation include reducing lipid peroxidation, increasing antioxidant enzymes, and chelating transition metal ions (102125).\nAntiaging effects\nCarnitine levels are thought to decrease with age and may contribute to age-associated frailty (58754). Laboratory research suggests that anti-aging benefits of L-carnitine may be associated with its benefits on oxidative damage and changes in heat shock protein expression (58159, 58223, 58244, 58536, 58667). In animal aging models, carnitine prevented age-related mitochondrial activity decline (58244, 58383, 58766), possibly by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis (58766).\nAnticachexic effects\nIn human research, L-carnitine, alone or in combination with other ingredients, has been shown to have benefit on body weight and body mass index in patients with cachexia (23437, 59012, 59029). Although the exact mechanisms of action are not clear, evidence from animal research suggests that carnitine improves cancer cachexia by regulating the expression and activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferase (58961) and restoring liver lipid parameters (58950).\nAnticancer effects\nL-carnitine is commonly used by cancer patients. L-carnitine, alone or in combination with butyrate, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro (58478, 58650). This anticancer effect may involve reduced prostaglandin E2 production and cyclooxygenase-2 expression, as well as increased expression of pro-apoptotic signaling proteins (58650) or decreased expression of anti-apoptotic signaling proteins (58478). Enzymes involved in apoptosis may also be affected by L-carnitine (58378, 58478).\nAntidiabetic effects\nCarnitine levels are lower in people with complications of diabetes (12746). Preliminary studies suggest that intravenous infusions of L-carnitine may produce short-term improvements in insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes (3651, 3652). Other preliminary clinical research suggests that L-carnitine might also improve glucose utilization, possibly by increasing expression of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes (12754). A small clinical study in children receiving hemodialysis shows that oral L-carnitine improves fasting blood glucose (107400). Although evidence is mixed, some evidence from clinical research in patients with diabetes suggests that L-carnitine might improve glycemic control or body weight when used alone or in combination with orlistat or sibutramine (58189, 58778, 58830, 58882, 90632). In laboratory models, L-carnitine has been shown to reduce tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, possibly due to increased nitric oxide production (58615). L-carnitine has also been shown to correct bradycardia associated with compromised glucose availability to the heart (58372) and normalize skeletal muscle lipids and oxidative stress associated with insulin-resistance (58373). Potential benefits may be due to protection against protein glycation and enhanced glucose disposal (58356).\nAntioxidant effects\nL-carnitine may have antioxidant properties (12352, 58150, 58306, 58843, 58997, 95071, 101566, 111899). L-carnitine has metal-chelating ability, which interferes with the formation of reactive oxygen species and stabilizes the free radicals that are formed (95071). In human research, L-carnitine has been shown to increase levels of glutathione, decrease levels of malondialdehyde, and increase the activity of superoxide dismutase (95071, 101566, 107403, 111899). A negative correlation between antioxidant activity and levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein(B) has been seen, suggesting its effects on lipids may be related to its antioxidant effects. Additionally, L-carnitine was negatively correlated with triglycerides and apolipoprotein(B) and positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein(A) (95071). However, some preliminary research suggests that acetyl-L-carnitine might lessen oxidative stress and prevent oxidative damage in the brain better than L-carnitine (12688). In laboratory research, the antioxidant effects of carnitine were found to be due to induced expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nitric oxide synthase (58201, 58976). In vitro, carnitine reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation (58665).\nAtherogenic effects\nIn human population research, the relationship between plasma L-carnitine levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and major cardiac events was suggested to be due to the metabolism of L-carnitine to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by the gut microbiota (90635, 95073). Evidence from animal research suggests that L-carnitine alters the gut microbial composition, resulting in an increased metabolism of L-carnitine to TMAO, reducing the removal of cholesterol, and increasing atherosclerosis (90635, 95073). Increased levels of TMAO have also occurred in humans following L-carnitine supplementation (111880, 111895). However, increased risk of cardiovascular disease following oral supplementation of L-carnitine has not been observed in humans. In fact, according to a meta-analysis of clinical trials in humans, L-carnitine supplementation is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, as well as ventricular arrhythmias and development of angina and does not increase the development of heart failure or myocardial reinfarction (59037). Also, results from another meta-analysis suggest no effect of L-carnitine on mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with a previous myocardial infarction (90630).\n\nAdditionally, laboratory research suggests that L-carnitine appears to inhibit advanced glycation end products (AGE)- modification (95073).\nBlood pressure effects\nL-carnitine may help reduce blood pressure. In animal models of hypertension, L-carnitine has resulted in blood pressure lowering (58519, 58708, 58796), possibly by mechanisms involving the reduction of nitric oxide (58422, 58796), inflammatory cytokines (58519), or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity (58519).\nBone effects\nL-carnitine may help improve bone density. In animal models, L-carnitine improves bone mineral density by suppressing bone turnover (58491). In laboratory research, L-carnitine protected against apoptosis of osteoblastic cells (58399). Potential mechanisms of action include decreased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation.\nCardioprotective effects\nL-carnitine is commonly used to improve heart health. In laboratory research, L-carnitine protects against hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling or related cardiac fibroblast proliferation and inflammation (58625, 58708). Myocardial metabolism has also been shown to be improved in animal models of cardiomyopathy (58559, 58891). Mechanisms of action appear to be related to signaling pathways involving, antioxidant effects, prostaglandins, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) (58253, 58559, 58625, 58708, 58891).\nCardiovascular effects\nA small observational cohort study in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction as well as kidney failure requiring hemodialysis shows that receiving intravenous L-carnitine 1 gram at the end of every hemodialysis session for 12 months is associated with improvements in E/e' ratio, left atrial volume index, and the early diastolic mitral annular velocity when compared with baseline. Improvements in left ventricular diastolic and systolic function were observed only in patients with left ventricular diastolic and systolic dysfunction, respectively, but not in patients with normal ventricular function, at baseline (107407).\nCognitive effects\nBy increasing levels of L-carnitine, the rate of fatty acid oxidation may be increased, leading to a reduction in the use of glucose and maintenance of muscle glycogen, and helping to maximize rates of ATP production (95070). In the brain, L-carnitine helps to synthesize acetylcholine and acetyl-L-carnitine. Acetyl-L-carnitine can then go through the blood brain barrier and modulate synaptic transmission and increase the release of neurohormones and neurotransmitters (95070).\nDialysis effects\nHemodialysis is associated with significant losses of L-carnitine (3616, 3645); which may contribute to malaise, muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias (3616). L-carnitine supplements, usually given intravenously after dialysis may improve exercise performance, reduce muscle cramps and hypotension, improve erythrocyte survival time, and decrease dose requirements for erythropoietin used to treat anemia (3645, 3646, 3647).\nExercise effects\nAlthough maximal exercise in trained athletes has been associated with a decrease in plasma L-carnitine levels (3648, 58583), restoring these levels with L-carnitine supplementation in clinical studies have reported conflicting results (1947, 58213, 59128, 59134, 59148, 59182, 59185). Potential mechanisms of action of L-carnitine have been explored. In animal models, L-carnitine has been shown to increase the oxidative capacity of liver and muscle during exercise (58840) and to promote recovery of muscle fiber thickness (58336). Also in animal research, carnitine prevented muscle degeneration associated with ovariectomy (58957). In humans with medication-induced muscle wasting, L-carnitine improves some, but not all, measures of muscle metabolism (111897). Other benefits of L-carnitine in animal models include an attenuated intermittent hypoxia-induced oxidative stress resulting in delayed muscle fatigue (58494), and increased time to exhaustion possibly related to antioxidant effects (58401). Vasodilating properties of L-carnitine were thought to be responsible for decreased pain and tenderness in muscle after an eccentric effort in untrained subjects (59148).\nEye effects\nThe antioxidant effects of L-carnitine may be beneficial in eye health. For example, in experimental glaucoma, L-carnitine reduced the damage to the optic disk associated with lipoperoxides in the cell membrane and resulting cell death (58932). In an insulin resistance model, L-carnitine protected against oxidation and glycation of the lens (58406).\nFertility effects\nThere is some evidence that L-carnitine has beneficial effects on fertility in humans. Animal models suggest that L-carnitine improves the quality of oocytes and embryos, improves hormone levels, and increases the weight of reproductive organs. This results in increased litter sizes. Laboratory research also suggests that L-carnitine protects oocytes and embryos in culture prior to IVF. The antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects, as well as energy producing effects, of L-carnitine are thought to be at least partially responsible for any fertility benefits. L-carnitine might also indirectly promote fertility by improving hormone release from the hypothalamus (96932).\nGastrointestinal effects\nL-carnitine may be beneficial for gastrointestinal inflammation associated with inflammatory bowel disorders. In animal colitis models, L-carnitine reduces damage to the colon (58214, 58575). Benefits may be associated with the antioxidant effects of L-carnitine (58214) and/or benefits on inflammatory cytokine levels and T-cell responses (58575).\nHIV effects\nPreliminary studies have reported that daily infusions of L-carnitine may improve CD4 cell counts in people with HIV infection and reduce the percentage of CD4 and CD8 cells undergoing apoptosis. There is some evidence L-carnitine inhibits the enzyme activity of acidic sphingomyelinase and prevents sphingomyelin breakdown in these cells (798, 3632, 8049).\nLipid-lowering effects\nAlthough preliminary clinical research suggests that L-carnitine does not reduce triglyceride levels in people with hypertriglyceridemia (59028, 59244), there is some evidence to suggest beneficial effects on lipoprotein(a) levels (58155, 95073) and other lipids (59188, 95073) in patients with elevated levels. Also, in animal models, there is some evidence to suggest that L-carnitine may reduce triglycerides and other lipid levels associated with a high-fat diet, possibly by reducing oxidative damage in the liver (31463, 58697). L-carnitine might decrease the production of lipoprotein(a) in the liver through increasing the breakdown of fatty acids (95073). It also might increase transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, which may lead to decreased availability of fatty acids for lipid synthesis (95071).\nSperm effects\nL-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine are present in human sperm and seminal fluid (3607). Their levels increase in sperm during the maturation process in the epididymis and coincide with the acquisition of progressive motility (3608, 3609). An increase in sperm motility is seen in vitro when L-carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine is added to the semen sample (3612, 58816). In human research, however, benefits on sperm motility are not seen in all studies. However, benefits have been shown for sperm count (59020). In animal models of oxidative stress impacting sperm count and motility, benefits of L-carnitine may be related to reduced inflammatory cytokines and improved antioxidant effects (58266, 58696, 58765).\nThyroid effects\nIn hyperthyroidism, L-carnitine seems to reduce symptoms by blocking entry of thyroid hormone into the nucleus of hepatocytes, neurons, and fibroblasts (8047).\nWeight loss effects\nAlthough taking L-carnitine alone does not appear to reduce body weight in overweight or obese people (58151, 58775), it may have weight loss effects when taken with orlistat or sibutramine (58778, 58830, 58882, 95074), or in some patients with type 2 diabetes (58189, 95074, 107393). A meta-analysis in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for at least 2 weeks reduces body mass index by a maximum of 1.5% (107393). The potential for weight loss effects of L-carnitine may be related to effects on satiety when used alone or in combination with other ingredients (59203, 90629, 90634, 90629). Taking L-carnitine along with other ingredients does not seem to increase energy expenditure (90629).\n\nIn laboratory research, L-carnitine has been shown to influence genes associated with lipolysis or adipogenicity (58313). Additionally, L-carnitine activates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This leads to a decrease in acetyl-CoA and activation of the glycolytic pathway (95074)."

            "Overview": "L-citrulline is a non-essential alpha-amino acid. It is produced naturally in the body and is metabolized to the amino acid L-arginine (94954, 94957). The name citrulline is derived from watermelon, Citrullus vulgaris, from which it was first isolated (16466).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. In clinical trials, L-citrulline has been used with apparent safety for up to 2 months at doses of 1.5-6 grams daily (94954, 94956, 94961, 94962, 100974). Doses of up to 15 grams have also been used as single doses or within a 24 hour period (16470, 16473).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. L-citrulline has been used with apparent safety in infants at a dose of 0.17 grams/kg daily (16472). It has also been used in children 6.5-10 years of age at a dose of 7.5 grams daily for 26 weeks (100976). ...when used intravenously and appropriately. An intravenous bolus dose of L-citrulline 150 mg/kg followed by 9 mg/kg/hour for 48 hours has been used safely in children under 6 years of age (16469).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Small studies show that taking a single oral dose of L-citrulline before anaerobic resistance exercise might reduce exhaustion and improve some performance measures. It is unclear if L-citrulline improves aerobic exercise performance; results are conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials in healthy trained and untrained adults shows that taking L-citrulline prior to mostly anaerobic exercise marginally reduces perceived exhaustion and muscle soreness when compared with placebo (105965). Another meta-analysis including some of the same clinical studies shows that taking L-citrulline malate before exercise modestly increases performance on resistance exercises by an average of 6% when compared with placebo (105968). Individual studies show mixed benefit and mostly use a single dose of L-citrulline malate 8 grams 1 hour before exercise; other studies used L-citrulline 3.3-6 grams mixed in watermelon juice or sucrose water or L-citrulline malate 12 grams given 1-2 hours before exercise (94966, 94957, 97395, 105965).\n\nL-citrulline has also been evaluated for use with aerobic exercise. A small study in healthy young adults taking L-citrulline 9 grams in 3 divided doses over 24 hours or as a single dose of 3 grams 3 hours before a treadmill test does not improve performance, but might reduce time to exhaustion, when compared with placebo (16473). Another small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking about 6.8 grams (100 mg/kg) of L-citrulline daily for 5 days prior to a cycling trial does not improve time to exhaustion, oxygen uptake, or lactate levels when compared with taking 3 grams of glucose as placebo (105964). However, two small clinical trials in healthy males show that taking L-citrulline 2.4-6 grams daily for 7 days prior to a cycling test improves peak power by 9%, total work by 7%, and cycling time trial performance by 1.5% when compared with placebo (94954, 94965). Differences in methods of testing athletic performance, the form and dose of L-citrulline used, and/or the duration of supplementation may explain the mixed results.\n\nL-citrulline has also been evaluated in combination with L-arginine. Research in male soccer players shows that taking L-citrulline 1.2 grams and L-arginine 1.2 grams daily for 7 days increases total power output over a 10-minute cycling test and improves subjective perceptions of exertion when compared with placebo (100956).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nSarcopenia. Oral L-citrulline does not seem beneficial for muscle strength in older adults when added to structured exercise.\nTwo small clinical studies in older adults show that taking L-citrulline in conjunction with structured exercise does not improve measures of strength, endurance, speed, or balance when compared with placebo and structured exercise (110146, 110148). One study evaluated otherwise healthy adults aged 60-73 years taking L-citrulline 3 grams daily for 6 weeks (110146). The other study evaluated older adults with obesity and an average age of 68.5 years taking a specific L-citrulline product (Citrage) 10 grams daily for 12 weeks (110148).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Although there is interest in using oral L-citrulline for CVD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-citrulline for this condition.\nDementia. Although there is interest in using oral L-citrulline for dementia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-citrulline for this condition.\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral L-citrulline is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nA small clinical study in adults with diabetes who are taking metformin and sulfonylureas shows that adding L-citrulline (Bulk Supplements Co., Ltd.) 3 grams daily before breakfast for 8 weeks reduces average fasting blood glucose levels by 22 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin by 0.7%, but does not affect lipid levels, when compared with taking a microcrystalline cellulose placebo (105963).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral L-citrulline is beneficial in patients with ED.\nA small non-randomized crossover study in adults with mild ED shows that taking L-citrulline 1.5 grams daily for one month improves erection hardness from \"mild dysfunction\" to \"normal function\" in 50% of patients, compared with only 8% of patients taking placebo (94956).\n\nL-citrulline has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A clinical study in middle-aged males with ED shows that taking a specific combination product (Revactin, MD Concepts LLC) containing L-citrulline, muira puama, ginger root, and guarana twice daily for 3 months improves scores related to erectile function and intercourse satisfaction, but does not improve sexual desire or orgasmic function scores, when compared to baseline (103224). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a placebo control, the use of per-protocol analysis, and a high dropout rate. In fact, 44% of patients withdrew in order to resume use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Another small clinical study in adults with ED living in Japan and using PDE5 inhibitors as needed shows that taking an adjunct 50 mL drink containing L-citrulline 800 mg, a specific fenugreek extract (Testofen) 600 mg, resveratrol 300 mg, and caffeine 40 mg daily for 14 days modestly improves erectile function and satisfaction with intercourse and orgasm when compared with a placebo drink (105966). The validity of this finding may be confounded by the \"as needed\" use of PDE5 inhibitors, which was not reported throughout the study. Further, in both combination studies, it is unclear if these effects are due to L-citrulline, other supplement ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHeart failure. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-citrulline might be beneficial in patients with heart failure.\nA very small clinical study in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) shows that taking L-citrulline malate 3 grams daily for 2 months decreases systolic pulmonary arterial pressure by 16% and improves the right ventricular ejection fraction after a stress test by 27% when compared to baseline (94962). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. Another small open-label clinical study in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) shows that taking L-citrulline 3 grams daily for 4 months increases left ventricular ejection fraction by about 20% at rest and 13% during the stress test, and increases the right ventricular ejection fraction by about 15%, both at rest and with the stress test, when compared with no supplementation. This improved the heart failure functional class in 35% of patients (94955).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral L-citrulline is beneficial for lowering blood pressure.\nA small clinical trial in adults with prehypertension shows that taking L-citrulline 2 grams with grape and cranberry polyphenols 548 mg daily for 6 weeks does not reduce mean ambulatory blood pressure when compared with a cellulose placebo (105969). A small crossover study in postmenopausal females with hypertension shows that taking L-citrulline 6 grams as a single dose does not improve systolic or diastolic blood pressure at rest or during 5 minutes of plantar flexion exercise when compared with placebo (110147). The effects of using L-citrulline regularly or in other patients with diagnosed hypertension is unclear.\nless\nLysinuric protein intolerance. Although there is interest in using oral L-citrulline for lysinuric protein intolerance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-citrulline for this condition.\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral L-citrulline can improve muscle strength when used in conjunction with resistance training.\nA clinical study in healthy resistance-trained adults shows that taking L-citrulline malate 2 grams daily for 8 weeks in conjunction with resistance training does not further increase lean mass or muscle strength, measured by leg and bench presses, when compared with a cellulose placebo and resistance training (97394).\nless\nMuscular dystrophy. It is unclear if oral L-citrulline is beneficial in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nA small clinical study in adults with Becker muscular dystrophy, a milder form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), shows that taking L-citrulline 5 grams with or without metformin 500 mg three times daily for 6 weeks improves 6-minute walking distance and decreases markers of muscle necrosis when compared to baseline (100975). A small clinical study in males aged 6.5-10 years with DMD shows that taking L-citrulline 2.5 grams with metformin 250 mg three times daily for 26 weeks does not appear to slow decline in motor function when compared with placebo. However, this combination seems to slow decline in children with more stable disease, defined as those who can walk at least 350 meters in 6 minutes (100976). The reasons for these disparate results are unclear, but they may be due to the different patient populations, disease severities, doses, and durations of therapy being studied.\nless\nPostoperative pulmonary hypertension. It is unclear if oral citrulline prevents postoperative hypertension in children undergoing heart surgery.\nA small clinical study in children 6 years of age and younger undergoing congenital heart surgery shows that higher blood levels of L-citrulline might protect against the incidence of postoperative hypertension. L-citrulline blood levels of at least 37 micromol/L immediately after surgery, and at 12, 24, and 36 hours postoperatively, protects against its development. However, supplementation with 1.9 grams/m2 during induction of anesthesia is not necessarily protective (16467).\nless\nPost-polio syndrome. It is unclear if oral L-citrulline is beneficial for patients with this condition.\nA small clinical study in adults with post-polio syndrome shows that taking L-citrulline 5 grams three times daily for 24 weeks does not improve 6-minute walking distance, motor function scores, muscle strength, or quality of life when compared with placebo (110149).\nless\nPulmonary hypertension. It is unclear if oral L-citrulline is beneficial in patients with pulmonary hypertension.\nA very small clinical study in patients with idiopathic arterial pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary hypertension due to Eisenmenger syndrome shows that taking L-citrulline malate 1 gram three times daily for 2 weeks increases 6-minute walking distance by 44 meters and reduces mean pulmonary arterial pressure by 5% when compared with baseline (94963). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nReye syndrome. Although there is interest in using oral L-citrulline for Reye syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-citrulline for this condition.\nSickle cell disease. It is unclear if oral L-citrulline is beneficial in patients with sickle cell disease.\nA small clinical study in children ages 10-18 years shows that taking L-citrulline 90-130 mg/kg daily in 2 divided doses for up to 9 months might reduce neutrophilia and other symptoms when compared with baseline (16463). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate L-citrulline for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nL-citrulline levels are increased 10-fold after a 2 gram dose and 100-fold after a 15 gram dose, but return to baseline within 5 to 8 hours after the dose (16470). Watermelons contain high levels of L-citrulline. Ingestion of 1-2 cups of watermelon juice three times daily, providing 1-2 grams of L-citrulline daily, results in an increase in plasma L-citrulline levels 1-2 hours after watermelon ingestion, which declines to baseline by 8 hours (16468). A small study in healthy adults shows that consuming watermelon 3.3 kg (wet weight) increases levels of citrulline from 22 to 593 mcmol/L one hour after ingestion and levels remain elevated after 8 hours; 2 hours after ingestion, arginine blood levels increased from 65 to 199 mcmol/L (16466).\nMetabolism\nL-citrulline passes through the liver unchanged and is taken up by the kidneys where it is converted to L-arginine and released into circulation. L-arginine is converted to nitric oxide by nitric oxide synthases in the endothelium of blood vessels and many other tissues, with L-citrulline being reformed in the process (16460, 16461, 16465, 16466, 16473). About 75% of L-citrulline taken up by the kidneys is converted to L-arginine and released into the circulation. Single oral doses of 2-15 grams of L-citrulline increase plasma L-arginine and L-ornithine levels in healthy males (16470). Ingestion of 1-2 cups of watermelon juice three times daily, providing 1-2 grams of L-citrulline daily, also results in a 12% to 22% increase in fasting L-arginine levels (16468). Doses of 0.75-3 grams of L-citrulline increase plasma L-arginine levels in a dose-dependent manner, and to a greater degree than L-arginine supplementation (16460, 16461). At a dose of 15 grams, L-citrulline plasma levels increase more than expected, and L-arginine levels increase less than expected, suggesting renal conversion of L-citrulline to L-arginine may become saturated (16470).\nExcretion\nLess than 5% of oral doses of L-citrulline is excreted unchanged in the urine (16470). The half-life of intravenous L-citrulline is 60 minutes in children under 6 years of age undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (16469).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nCitrulline is an alpha-amino acid. The L-form of citrulline is naturally occurring, but it is a non-essential amino acid and is not used in protein synthesis (16460, 16461, 16465). L-citrulline can be obtained from food. A rich food source of L-citrulline is watermelon, which contains 0.7-3.6 mg L-citrulline per gram of fruit (16466, 16468).\n\nL-citrulline is synthesized in both the intestinal mucosa and the liver. It is synthesized in the intestinal mucosa from glutamine and ornithine (16461, 16466). In the hepatic mitochondria, it is an intermediate in the urea cycle, which converts ammonia to urea (16466). Ammonia and bicarbonate are combined with L-ornithine by the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase to produce L-citrulline. This is converted by argininosuccinate synthetase to argininosuccinate, and then to L-arginine by argininosuccinate lyase. Urea is formed when L-arginine is converted back to L-ornithine, completing the cycle (16466). L-citrulline produced in this process does not leave the liver (16465). Some urea cycle disorders, such as argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency and argininosuccinic acid lyase deficiency are associated with elevated L-citrulline levels (citrullinemia) (16466, 16472). Although L-citrulline is not used for protein synthesis, some proteins in the body can become citrullinated, including keratin in the skin. Lower levels of keratin citrullination have been reported in people with psoriasis, although the significance of this is not fully understood (16465).\n\nL-citrulline is taken as an oral supplement as a source of L-arginine. There is speculation that L-citrulline may be preferable to L-arginine for this purpose. Doses of 0.75 grams to 3 grams of L-citrulline increase plasma L-arginine levels in a dose-dependent manner, and to a greater degree than L-arginine supplementation (16460, 16461). Whereas L-citrulline passes through the liver unchanged, ingested L-arginine is metabolized before it reaches the systemic circulation, significantly reducing its systemic availability, and also causing excessive production of urea (16460, 16461, 16464, 16465).\nCardiovascular effects\nCongenital heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with reduced plasma L-arginine and L-citrulline levels and reduced endogenous nitric oxide production. Since nitric oxide dilates the pulmonary vasculature, this reduction increases the risk for postoperative pulmonary hypertension (16467, 16469). Preliminary clinical research suggests L-citrulline might reduce this risk by increasing L-arginine levels and nitric oxide production (16467, 16469, 94961, 94964).\n\nIn males, L-citrulline 5.6 grams daily for 7 days improved markers of arterial stiffness (94961). Intake of 6 grams daily for one month also prevented a rise in brachial and aortic blood pressure following cold-induced vasoconstriction (94958). However, a meta-analysis of five small clinical studies in patients ranging from healthy to those with pulmonary hypertension shows that L-citrulline does not appear to reduce brachial or aortic blood pressure when compared with placebo (100974).\n\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in various patient populations suggests that L-citrulline intake, either via L-citrulline supplementation or watermelon consumption, has a limited impact on vascular function or cardiometabolic risk markers. This research suggests that use of L-citrulline for one day or more may improve flow-mediated dilation, while longer-term watermelon consumption may improve pulse wave velocity; however, other parameters of vascular function were not affected. Longer-term L-citrulline supplementation or watermelon consumption did not improve serum glucose, insulin, or total cholesterol (110150). The validity of these results is limited by inclusion of highly heterogeneous studies and lack of evaluation for study quality.\n\nIn healthy adults, taking L-citrulline 3.2 grams decreased the ECG QT interval, the time required to complete myocardial depolarization and repolarization. In myocardial infarction patients, a prolonged QT interval is a marker of sudden cardiac death (94959).\nErgogenic effects\nL-citrulline increases levels of nitric oxide and seems to prevent exercise-induced reductions in nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the blood (94961, 94964, 105967). It has been suggested that increasing nitric oxide production by L-citrulline supplementation might increase exercise capacity (16473). Nitric oxide dilates arterial and venous blood vessels and increases glucose uptake and insulin secretion (16460, 16461). However, exercise results in the breakdown of nitric oxide. In vitro and animal research shows that taking reduced glutathione protects against the breakdown of L-citrulline-induced nitric oxide production (94960).\n\nTaking L-citrulline prior to exercise seems to reduce serum levels of branched chain amino acids (suggesting increased metabolic use), and increase levels of antioxidant markers. Theoretically, these metabolic and antioxidant effects might contribute to reduced muscle soreness and fatigue (94964, 94965, 105967).\nHematologic effects\nL-citrulline, as a precursor of L-arginine and nitric oxide, might be useful in sickle cell disease. Endothelial damage and inflammatory vasculopathy associated with sickle cell disease are mediated in part by increased levels of activated neutrophils, which release proteolytic enzymes and superoxide anions, and break down nitric oxide (16463). Nitric oxide-induced vasodilatation might also help circulation of the distorted red blood cells (16465). Preliminary data from animals suggest that L-citrulline can improve endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and relax arterial smooth muscle by an effect on cyclic-GMP (16475, 16476).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy has been associated with impaired nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. While taking L-citrulline can increase NOS production, activation of NOS in skeletal muscle depends on adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Metformin is a known activation or AMPK in skeletal muscle. Therefore, taking L-citrulline with metformin is thought to have synergistic effects in patients with muscular dystrophy, leading to enhanced mitochondrial function, increased energy, and reduced declines in muscle function (100975, 100976).\nProtein synthesis effects\nIn conditions such as short bowel syndrome, celiac disease, radiation-induced small bowel damage, and intestinal resection, the site of L-citrulline synthesis in the intestinal mucosa is damaged, and both L-citrulline and L-arginine levels are reduced, interfering with protein and nitric oxide synthesis. Animal research suggests that L-citrulline supplements might increase tissue L-arginine levels and improve nitrogen balance in these conditions (16464, 16465). L-citrulline might improve muscle protein levels in malnourished animals. It is thought that increased liver sequestration and metabolism of amino acids might contribute to the poor response to a high-protein diet, which is sometimes seen in malnourished elderly people. L-citrulline, which bypasses the liver, might increase delivery of nitrogen to peripheral tissues for protein synthesis (16474).\nUrea cycle effects\nSome genetic defects in the urea cycle can prevent conversion of L-ornithine to L-citrulline. In lysinuric protein intolerance, there is a defect in L-ornithine transport, resulting in episodic hyperammonemia, growth and mental retardation, seizures, osteopenia, and muscle weakness. It is thought that L-citrulline supplements might restore normal processing of ammonia by increasing production of L-ornithine via the urea cycle in the liver, bypassing the transport defect (16462). In ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, L-ornithine is not converted to L-citrulline, reducing the production of L-arginine for protein synthesis. This might be corrected by using L-citrulline supplements (16472). It is also thought that some cases of Reye syndrome involve an enzyme defect in the urea cycle, which could be corrected with L-citrulline supplements (16471)."

It occurs naturally in foods and is made in the body from L-methionine (109717, 109725).\nAnti-alcohol effects\nL-cysteine is of interest for alcohol use disorder. In an animal model, providing L-cysteine reduces the motivation for self-administration with ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde (109720).\nAnti-cancer effects\nL-cysteine is of interest for the prevention of cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract caused by acetaldehyde, a carcinogen. In human research, taking L-cysteine 200 mg along with intragastric instillation of ethanol 0.3 grams/kg reduces levels of gastric acetaldehyde and increases gastric levels of the metabolite 2-methyl-1,3-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (MTCA) (109711). Taking L-cysteine has also been shown to reduce levels of acetaldehyde in the saliva (109717).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nL-cysteine is of interest for its anti-inflammatory effects. In an animal model of colitis, improvement in gut function was associated with a reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines (109723).\nAnti-obesity effects\nAs an amino acid, L-cysteine is of interest for its appetite suppressant effects. In animal research, L-cysteine reduces ghrelin levels and food intake and delays gastric emptying. The effect on food intake was more beneficial with L-cysteine than D-cysteine and was found with both oral and intraperitoneal dosing. In humans, L-cysteine reduces ghrelin levels and hunger. There was no effect on plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) (109719). In another animal model, the decreased food intake and fat mass was associated with increased antioxidative enzyme activity (109722).\nAntioxidant effects\nAs a precursor of glutathione, methionine, and taurine, L-cysteine is of interest for its antioxidant effects (109717, 109723). In humans, taking L-cysteine improved the antioxidant status after athletic performance (109724). In various animal models, L-cysteine demonstrated antioxidant effects by reducing oxidative stress markers, increasing antioxidant levels, enhancing key enzyme activity such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, and decreasing free radicals and lipid peroxidation (109725, 115478, 109722).\nNeurological effects\nL-cysteine plays a role in some neurological processes and may act as a neuromodulator (109713, 109717). L-cysteine is needed for the synthesis of glutathione and is involved in redox balance (109713). In vitro, L-cysteine is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-alpha receptor antagonist. This mechanism does not seem to be associated with the effects of L-cysteine on redox balance (109713). However, neurotoxic effects of L-cysteine in animal models have been reported, which may be possibly related to the formation of L-cysteine metabolites (109713). In animal models of oxidative stress, L-cysteine increases acetylcholine and decreases acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampus (115478)."

For example, egg lecithin contains 69% phosphatidylcholine and 24% phosphatidylethanolamine, while soybean lecithin contains 24% phosphatidylcholine, 22% phosphatidylethanolamine, and 19% phosphatidylinositol (5156). The fatty acids contained in lecithin are primarily omega-6 fatty acids and a small amount of omega-3 fatty acids (14821).\nCardiovascular effects\nWhen taken orally, lecithin increases omega-6 fatty acid levels, but does not affect omega-3 levels. The increase in omega-6 levels is associated with an increase in platelet adhesion (14821). However, the overall effect of lecithin on cardiovascular health is unknown.\n\nAnimal research suggests that administering a preparation containing doxorubicin and lecithin induces the same antitumor activity as doxorubicin alone, but the severity and extent of doxorubicin-induced myocardial lesions are reduced and their onset is delayed (59277).\nCutaneous absorption effects\nIn human clinical research, using lecithin as an emulsifier in a diclofenac gel formulation improves absorption of the drug across the skin when compared with a formulation without lecithin. In patients with joint pain or minor traumatic injuries, the lecithin-containing product provides a more rapid onset of action and, in some cases, improved pain control (19216, 19217, 19218).\nHepatoprotective effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that lecithin may protect against alcohol-induced liver damage (59270).\nHumectant effect\nLecithin is commonly used in topical hydrating products as a humectant. Lecithin reduces transepidermal water loss by occlusion (93067). By increasing skin hydration, anecdotal evidence suggests lecithin helps improve some skin conditions, including dermatitis and dry skin; however, there is no reliable clinical research.\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nTaking lecithin orally can increase serum choline, which is a precursor to acetylcholine (14822, 14836, 14838). As a source of choline, it was thought that lecithin might help alleviate symptoms of cholinergic diseases such as Alzheimer disease and tardive dyskinesia.

In this study, using the nasal spray reduced airway resistance during inspiration at 10 and 20 minutes after pollen exposure, and reduced airway resistance during expiration at 20 minutes after pollen exposure (98826).\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if aromatherapy with lemon essential oil reduces anxiety.\nA small clinical study in first year nursing students in Turkey shows that administering aromatherapy with lemon essential oil for 15 minutes prior to an exam reduces test anxiety scores when compared with control students (110779). However, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant or lead to improved test scores.\n\nLemon oil has also been evaluated in pregnancy. A small clinical trial in Turkey in pregnant adults in active labor shows that administering aromatherapy with lemon oil, 1 drop placed on a cotton ball, every hour until delivery does not reduce anxiety when compared with control (115746).\nless\nHalitosis. Lemon essential oil has only been evaluated in combination with other essential oils; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary research in males with dementia in a long-term care facility shows that cleaning the tongue, gums, and teeth with a solution of lemon, peppermint, and tea tree essential oils twice daily for 7 days improves oral condition, measured on the Korean Oral Assessment Guide scale, increases salivary pH into the normal range, and decreases halitosis score when compared with saline control. On a scale of 0 to 5, the essential oil mixture reduced the halitosis score by 1.24 points, compared with 0.2 points for the control (112957).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral lemon is beneficial in patients with high blood pressure.\nA small, prospective, population study in middle-aged Japanese women has found that increased lemon intake is associated with a modest reduction in systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure (93471).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if oral lemon juice is beneficial for recurrent idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.\nA randomized, controlled trial in patients with recurrent idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis shows that taking fresh lemon juice 60 mL orally twice daily for 2 years with a standard diet does not improve the time to stone recurrence when compared with no supplementation. The validity of these findings is limited due to poor patient adherence, which declined from 79% at 6 months, to 68% at 1 year, and 48% at 2 years. When restricted to a 1-year follow-up, stone recurrence occurred in 10% of patients taking lemon juice, compared with 21% of patients in the control group; this difference was statistically significant (107489).\nless\nLabor pain. It is unclear if aromatherapy with lemon oil is beneficial for labor pain.\nA small clinical trial in Turkey in pregnant adults in active labor shows that administering aromatherapy with lemon oil, 1 drop placed on a cotton ball every hour until delivery, modestly reduces patient-reported pain during the early phase (cervical dilation 5-7 cm) when compared with control (115746). However, clinical significance is unclear, and pain is not reduced during the later phase of active labor (cervical dilation 8-10 cm).\nless\nMeniere disease. Although there is interest in using lemon orally for Meniere disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lemon for this condition.\nMyocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if aromatherapy with lemon essential oil is beneficial in patients with acute MI.\nA small clinical study in hospitalized patients with acute MI shows that administering aromatherapy with lemon essential oil over 3 days moderately reduces systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, when compared with a paraffin control. Heart rate and anxiety were reduced by a small amount the day following the completion of lemon aromatherapy (103455).\nless\nNausea and vomiting. It is unclear if aromatherapy with lemon oil is beneficial in palliative care patients with nausea and vomiting.\nA small observational study in hospitalized palliative care patients with advanced cancer has found that administering aromatherapy with lemon oil pads relieves nausea and vomiting in 73% of applications (110778). The interpretation of these findings is limited by the use of a retrospective chart review and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nObesity. Although there is interest in using lemon orally for obesity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lemon for this condition.\nOral mucositis. Lemon has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA randomized, controlled trial in patients with head and neck cancer receiving external beam radiotherapy 5 days weekly shows that using a 2:1 oral honey-lemon throat spray four to eight times daily, beginning 1 day prior to radiotherapy initiation and continuing for 5 weeks, does not improve severity of mucositis when compared with oral benzydamine hydrochloride throat spray applied four to eight times daily. The actual rate of oral mucositis occurrence is 65% in those receiving the honey-lemon spray, compared with 35% with the benzydamine hydrochloride spray; however, this difference was not statistically significant (107487). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Also, the validity of these findings is limited due to the lack of objective outcome measures.\nless\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if aromatherapy with lemon essential oil is beneficial in patients with PONV.\nPreliminary research in patients undergoing lower extremity fracture surgery shows that aromatherapy with lemon essential oil started the morning of surgery, then every 2 hours to the end of surgery, in the recovery room, and 16 hours after surgery reduces the frequency, severity, and amount of PONV, and the frequency of anti-emetic drug administration after surgery, when compared with control. The intensity of pain is also reduced, but not the amount of post-operative opioid needed (112956).\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. It is unclear if aromatherapy with lemon essential oil is beneficial in patients with nausea and vomiting due to pregnancy.\nA small clinical study in pregnant patients shows that practicing aromatherapy with 2 drops of lemon essential oil placed on a cotton ball as needed modestly reduces pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting on 2 of 4 days of the study when compared with placebo (93475).\nless\nRadiation-induced sialadenitis. Aromatherapy with lemon essential oil has only been evaluated in combination with other essential oils; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with thyroid cancer shows that receiving 10-minute aromatherapy baths with lemon and ginger essential oils prior to meals for 2 weeks before treatment with radioactive iodine therapy attenuates damage to the salivary gland when compared with distilled water baths (98129).\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Although there is interest in using lemon orally for respiratory tract infections such as cold and flu, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lemon for these conditions.\nMore evidence is needed to rate lemon for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with lemon.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of lemon.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of lemon are the fruit, juice, and peel. Lemon fruit is made up of sugars, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. Fruit pulp generally consists of about 40% sugars and 50% polysaccharides. Polysaccharides of lemon include pectin substances containing galacturonan, cellulose, glucan, xylan, and arabinan (15214). Lemon fruit contains about 53 mg of vitamin C per 100 grams. The sugar content of lemon juice depends on where it is produced. California lemon juice contains 0.81% to 3.2% sugar; Florida lemon juice contains about 3.7% sugar (15214).\n\nLemon bioflavonoids include diosmin, eriodictyol, hesperidin, neohesperidoside, naringenin, eriodictyol glycoside, neodiosmin, rutinoside, chrysoeriol, isorhamnetin, limocitrin, limocitrol, isolimocitrol, and others (15168, 15214). Some research suggests that bioflavonoid composition differs depending on the ripeness of the fruit. Unripe lemon contains mostly hesperidin, while ripened lemon contains eriodictyol, or demethylated hesperidin. However, other research contradicts this, suggesting that eriodictyol is the predominant bioflavonoid at all stages of ripeness (15168). In fresh lemon juice, the hesperidin content is 0.046% to 0.12%, depending on the preparation of the juice. Fresh, undiluted lemon juice with pulp contains higher amounts of hesperidin (15213).\n\nOther constituents include limonoids, coumarins, and citrus oils. Limonene from citrus oil is the most abundant monoterpene in lemon juice. Beta- and gamma-terpinene, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-terpineol, neral, and geranial are also found in the essential oil (4946, 15214, 103455, 112956). Limonene, limonoids, and lemon flavonoids give lemon its flavoring and aroma (15213, 15214). Lemon oil contains several coumarins, including bergapten, oxypeucedanin, imperatorin, 8-geranyloxypsolaren, isopimpinellin, phellopterin, 5-geranyloxy-8-methoxypsoralen, and others (11019, 15214). Coumarins have also been isolated from lemon peel and lemon juice, including 8-geranyloxypsolaren, bergamottin, 5-geranyloxy-7-methoxycoumarin, citropten, and oxypeucedanin (15208, 15212).\n\nLemons have a substantially higher acidity than other citrus fruits. Acidity level is primarily determined by citric acid and malic acid content. Lemon fruit contains 4% to 4.38% citric acid and 0.07% to 0.26% malic acid, with an overall acidity of 3.5% to 6% (15214).\nAnti-allergic effects\nThere is interest in using intranasal lemon to treat allergy symptoms. In laboratory research, lemon inhibits histamine release and stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators (98826).\nAnti-anxiety effects\nThere is interest in using lemon essential oil as aromatherapy to treat pain and anxiety. In animal models, exposure to lemon essential oil aroma seems to increase the pain threshold. Lemon essential oil aroma also decreases plasma corticosterone levels. However, the lemon aroma appears to increase anxiety levels in animal models (15209). In human research, lemon aromatherapy reduces systolic blood pressure and heart rate (103445).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in the potential anticancer activity of citrus flavonoids. Some of these flavonoids, such as diosmin, appear to inhibit experimental mutagenesis in vitro (15210). Some lemon flavonoids also seem to inhibit in vitro activation of the nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), an environmental carcinogen (15211). These processes may be inhibited via inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes (15210, 15211).\nAntioxidant effects\nSome of the coumarins in lemon appear to reduce free radical generation by inhibiting the production of nitric oxide (15208). Lemon compounds have demonstrated antioxidant effects in animal research. In animal models of diabetes, a diet containing lemon flavonoids consisting of 0.2% eriodictyol glycoside and 0.2% hesperidin results in reduced measures of oxidative stress after 28 days of treatment (15215).\nBone mineral density effects\nThe chelating effect of the citric acid component of lemon may increase potassium and calcium reabsorption, which has led to interest in its use for bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism. A small clinical study in postmenopausal adults suggests that ingestion of a 290-mL beverage containing 30 mL of lemon juice with calcium 350 mg daily for 11 months modestly improves lumbar spine and proximal femur BMD when compared to baseline, but not when compared with a control group or a group consuming lemon juice without calcium. Additionally, this combination may modestly decrease bone resorption markers (e.g. tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b and bone alkaline phosphatase), bone formation markers (e.g. osteocalcin), and other factors related to bone metabolism, such as highly sensitive parathyroid hormone (107488).\nDrug metabolism effects\nThere has been some interest in using lemon juice to potentiate the effect of sildenafil, which undergoes metabolism through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. However, clinical research in healthy adult men shows that lemon juice does not alter the pharmacokinetics or plasma concentration of sildenafil (93470). Similarly, in rats with induced erectile dysfunction, administering lemon juice 0.5-1 mL/kg daily for 21 days did not lead to synergistic effects with sildenafil (110777).\n\nIn laboratory research, lemon inhibited the mutagenic activity of heterocyclic amines, indicating possible inhibitory activity at CYP1A2 (15210). Other laboratory research has shown that lemon inhibits activation of nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), which may be mediated through inhibition of CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B1, 2D6, and/or 2E1 (15211).\nGlycemic effects\nIn healthy adults, consuming lemon juice with bread reduced the glycemic response to the bread, with a 33-35% reduction in peak glucose levels and an approximately 35 minute delay to peak levels. The low pH of the lemon juice likely inhibits the activity of salivary amylase, as demonstrated in vitro (103456, 110780).\nInner ear effects\nIn Meniere's disease, a specific lemon bioflavonoid, eriodictyol glycoside, is theorized to increase circulation to the inner ear (15167); however, this has not been verified.\nNeurological effects\nEarly research in animals suggests that lemon juice might increase memory. It is theorized that this is mediated by the antioxidant activity of the constituent flavonoids (93474).\nRenal effects\nLemons, lemon juice, and lemonade contain high levels of citric acid, a popular treatment for people with kidney stones. Consuming lemon products seems to increase urinary citrate levels (15170). Theoretically, this might result in decreased incidence of calcium kidney stone formation. Lemon contains about 49 grams of citric acid per kilogram of lemon. This is significantly higher than other fruits such as orange (11 grams/kg), grapefruit (14 grams/kg), pineapple (6 grams/kg), cranberry (11 grams/kg), or raspberry (17 grams/kg) (15170). However, it is theorized that the efficacy of each fruit for reducing kidney stone formation may be dependent on multiple factors. The citrate in lemon is complexed with a proton, which might decrease its ability to alkalize the urine. Comparatively, the citrate content in oranges is primarily complexed with potassium. When lemonade and orange juice products are diluted to contain an equal amount of citrate, orange juice raises urinary pH and urinary citrate to a greater extent than lemonade (15171). In clinical research, consuming 85 mL of freshly squeezed lemon juice (containing 60 mEq citrate) daily for 3 months increased urinary citrate by 2.5-fold, which is equally as effective to conventional treatment with potassium citrate 60 mEq daily (93472). However, the impact of this increased urinary citrate level on kidney stone formation has not been evaluated.\nSexual effects\nIn rats with induced erectile dysfunction, administering lemon juice 0.5-1 mL/kg daily for 21 days improves sexual behavior, increases levels of nitric oxide, and inhibits phosphodiesterase-5 activity, but does not lead to synergistic effects with sildenafil (110777)."

Symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness started 1 week into use of the product. Product discontinuation led to restoration of normal sinus rhythm within 24 hours and normalization of the electrocardiogram within 2 weeks (112556). It is unclear whether this occurrence is due to lemon balm, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDermatologic\nTopically, lemon balm 1% cream applied 5 times daily to cold sores has been associated with two cases of irritation and one case of cold sore exacerbation. However, these effects do not appear to occur more often with lemon balm than with placebo (790).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, lemon balm might increase appetite in some patients (91732, 104433).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDepression. Small clinical trials show that oral lemon balm may improve depression when used short-term; the long-term effects are unclear. It is also unclear if lemon balm aromatherapy is beneficial for depression.\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults with depression and/or anxiety shows that using lemon balm, usually orally, daily for 3-56 days moderately improves depression scores when compared with control. Lemon balm was used orally as 1200-3000 mg daily or as aromatherapy for 30 minutes daily (110136).\n\nOther individual studies also show that oral lemon balm may modestly improve depression. A small clinical study in adults with mostly mild depression shows that taking lemon balm 2 grams daily for 8 weeks moderately improves depressive symptoms when compared with baseline. The improvement appears to be similar to taking lavender powder 2 grams daily or fluoxetine 20 mg daily (104433). However, this study was inadequately powered to detect differences between groups. A small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes and mild to moderate depression conducted in Iran shows that taking lemon balm extract capsules 350 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces the severity of depression and anxiety based on validated patient-reported questionnaires when compared with placebo (111741). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by methodological flaws in outcome analysis.\n\nAlthough studies have assessed oral lemon balm as monotherapy, its use in combination with other ingredients has also been explored. A small clinical study in patients with mild or moderate depression shows that taking lemon balm 600 mg with fertilized egg powder (Young Tissue Extract) 1,680 mg daily for 12 weeks improves symptoms when compared with placebo, but not when compared with taking fertilized egg powder alone (19534). Additionally, a single-center clinical study in Iranian adults with constipation-predominate irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) shows that taking a lemon balm, anise, and rose hip extract supplement twice daily for 4 weeks reduces anxiety and depression scores,on a patient-reported survey, when compared with placebo (115636). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of data regarding history or diagnosis of anxiety or depression. It is not clear if this effect is due to lemon balm, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHerpes labialis (cold sores). Topical lemon balm 1% lotion seems to be beneficial for the healing of recurrent cold sores.\nClinical research in patients with recurring cold sores shows that applying a cream containing 1% lemon balm dried leaf extract (LomaHerpan, Infectopharm) at the early stages seems to shorten healing time and reduce symptoms of recurring cold sores when compared with placebo (790, 9995).\nless\nStress. Oral lemon balm seems to be beneficial for improving experimentally-induced stress in some patients.\nA small study in healthy adults suggests that a single dose of lemon balm extract 600 mg increases calmness and alertness during laboratory-induced psychological stress when compared with placebo (19524). Another small study in healthy adults shows that a single dose of lemon balm extract (Bluenesse, Vital Solutions) 300 mg added to food or drink reduces anxiety and improves memory and alertness during multi-task cognitive testing when compared with placebo (91733).\n\nLemon balm has also shown benefit when used in combination with other ingredients for stress. Lemon balm 240 mg has been used in combination with valerian 360 mg (Songha Night, Pharmaton Natural Health Products) (19405). Lemon balm 50 mg has been used in combination with valerian root 90 mg, passion flower 90 mg, and butterbur 90 mg (Relaxane, Max Zeller Sӧhne AG) (97276).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral lemon balm is beneficial for improving cognitive function.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with age-related cognitive impairment shows that taking lemon balm leaf extract, standardized to contain 500 mg rosmarinic acid, orally daily for 96 weeks does not improve cognitive function scores when compared with placebo (110142).\nless\nAlzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral lemon balm is beneficial for improving cognitive function.\nA small clinical study in elderly patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking a leaf extract of lemon balm (standardized to citral 500 mcg/mL) 60 drops daily for 4 months seems to reduce agitation and improve cognitive function when compared with placebo (9993). This study was limited by a large number of drop-outs in the placebo group. An even smaller clinical study in patients with mild Alzheimer disease shows that taking lemon balm extract containing 500 mg rosmarinic acid daily for 24 weeks does not seem to improve cognition, but might modestly improve neuropsychiatric symptoms, when compared with placebo (104435). The validity of these findings is limited because the study was not powered to evaluate cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms.\nless\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral lemon balm or lemon balm aromatherapy is beneficial for reducing anxiety in most patients.\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults with depression and/or anxiety shows that using lemon balm daily for 3-56 days moderately improves anxiety scores when compared with control. Lemon balm was used orally as 1200-3000 mg daily or as aromatherapy for 30 minutes daily (110136). The validity of this result is limited by high heterogeneity. Also, a small clinical study in patients with mild or moderate anxiety disorders shows that taking a specific standardized lemon balm extract (Cyracos, Naturex SA) 300 mg twice daily reduces anxiety-associated symptoms and improves sleep when compared with baseline (104425). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Another small clinical study in adults with type 2 diabetes and mild to moderate depression conducted in Iran shows that taking lemon balm extract capsules 350 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces the severity of depression and anxiety based on validated patient-reported questionnaires when compared with placebo (111741).\n\nAlthough studies have assessed oral lemon balm as monotherapy, its use in combination with other ingredients has also been explored. A single-center clinical study in Iranian adults with constipation-predominate irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) shows that taking a lemon balm, anise, and rose hip extract supplement twice daily for 4 weeks reduces anxiety and depression scores, on a patient-reported survey, when compared with placebo (115636).

Although there is interest in using oral lemon balm for bronchitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lemon balm for this condition.\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral lemon balm is beneficial for improving memory and response time in healthy patients.\nA small study in healthy young adults shows that taking a single dose of lemon balm 1600 mg increases memory accuracy, but may slow performance on timed memory tasks, when compared with placebo (19530). Another small study shows that taking a combination product containing equal parts lemon balm, sage, and rosemary, 5 grams of plant material per 10 mL solution, twice daily for 2 weeks might modestly improve delayed, but not immediate, word recall when compared with placebo in healthy adults 62 years of age or younger. No benefits were seen in adults 63 years of age and older (97277). It is not clear if this effect is due to lemon balm, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nColic. Oral lemon balm has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical studies in breast-fed or formula-fed infants with colic show that giving specific multi-ingredient products containing lemon balm 65-97 mg and German chamomile 9-178 mg, with or without fennel 164 mg and inactivated Lactobacillus acidophilus (ColiMil; ColiMil Plus, Milte Italia SPA), orally twice daily for 1-4 weeks reduces crying times when compared with either placebo or simethicone (16735, 96278). Another small clinical study in infants shows that giving 150 mL of a specific herbal tea preparation (Calma-Bebi, Bonomelli), containing German chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel, and lemon balm, up to three times daily after an episode of colic for one week, modestly reduces colic when compared with placebo water without herbs (19715). It is not known if the benefits of these multi-ingredient preparations are due to lemon balm, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDelirium. Oral lemon balm has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in adults in the intensive care unit with agitation and delirium who are receiving quetiapine 50-200 mg every 12 hours shows that taking 5 mL of a syrup containing lemon balm leaf extract 50 mg and valerian root 625 mg orally every 12 hours improves agitation when compared to baseline. Although the improvement appeared to similar to that seen in those taking placebo, no statistical comparison was conducted between groups (106627).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral lemon balm is beneficial for reducing neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, such as agitation.\nA small clinical study in patients with severe dementia and agitation shows that applying a lotion containing essential oil of lemon balm to the faces and hands of patients for 4 weeks reduces agitation based on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) scale when compared with applying a placebo lotion (19523). However, another small clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease and prolonged agitation shows that applying lemon balm oil by gentle massage for 1-2 minutes twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce agitation when compared with applying placebo oil (19522). The validity of these results is limited by the notable improvement observed in the placebo group, which may have been due to the regular physical touch and increased social interaction that occurred in this group. A small clinical study in patients with dementia shows that inhaling lemon balm oil from a small pad attached to the collar of clothing for 2 hours once daily for 2 weeks does not reduce agitation based on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and CMAI scales when compared with placebo (99710).\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral lemon balm is beneficial in patients with dyslipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies in adults shows that oral lemon balm extract, leaf powder, or tea in doses ranging from 700-4000 mg daily for 8-24 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) when compared with placebo; however, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear (115638). The validity of these results is limited by the heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including population, dose, and study duration.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Although there is interest in using oral lemon balm for dysmenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lemon balm for this condition.\nDyspepsia. Oral lemon balm has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of four small clinical studies in patients with IBS shows that using a specific combination product containing lemon balm (Iberogast, Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH) 1 mL orally three times daily over a period of 4 weeks reduces severity of acid reflux, epigastric pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting when compared with placebo. The combination includes lemon balm, peppermint leaf, German chamomile, caraway, licorice, clown's mustard plant, celandine, angelica, and milk thistle (13089). In another clinical study, taking a similar combination product containing extracts from peppermint leaf, clown's mustard plant, German chamomile flower, caraway, licorice root, and lemon balm (STW 5-II, Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH), 1 mL orally three times daily for up to 8 weeks eliminates gastrointestinal symptoms in 40% more dyspepsia patients when compared with placebo (12724).\nless\nHeadache. Although there is interest in using oral lemon balm for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lemon balm for this condition.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral lemon balm is beneficial for hypertension.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with uncontrolled hypertension while on 1-3 active treatments shows that taking lemon balm extract 400 mg, standardized to contain 8 mg rosmarinic acid, orally daily for 4 weeks reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 8% to 14% and 11% to 16%, respectively, when compared with baseline. These improvements were significant when compared with placebo (110138).\nless\nHyperthyroidism. Although there is interest in using oral lemon balm for hyperthyroidism, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lemon balm for this condition.\nInsect repellent. Although there is interest in using topical lemon balm as insect repellant, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lemon balm for this condition.\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral lemon balm is beneficial for insomnia.\nA small, cross-over clinical study in Italy in adults with self-reported poor sleep quality shows that taking a specific lemon balm phytosome (Meloff, Pharmextracta SpA) 400 mg 30 minutes prior to bed for 2 weeks improves some, but not all, measures of sleep quality when compared with placebo . (115637). However, it is unclear if these improvements are clinically significant.\n\nAdditionally, lemon balm has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Taking a specific combination product providing lemon balm leaf extract 80 mg and valerian root extract 160 mg (Euvegal forte, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 2-3 times daily appears to improve the quality and quantity of sleep in healthy people and those diagnosed with insomnia or sleeping disorders (10423, 19528, 19536). However, lower daily doses may not improve sleep (10421). Other clinical research in healthy adults with insomnia shows that using a combination product containing ground lemon balm herb 1000 mg and aqueous extract of Nepeta menthoides 400 mg at bedtime for 4 weeks improves sleep quality and sleep duration and reduces sleep disturbance, sleep latency, and daytime dysfunction when compared with placebo (97278). A clinical study in children 12 years and younger shows that a specific combination product containing lemon balm leaf extract 80 mg and valerian root extract 160 mg (Euvegal forte, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 1-2 tablets once or twice daily might decrease symptoms of restlessness and dyssomnia when compared to baseline (14416). It is unclear if these effects are due to lemon balm, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral lemon balm has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with IBS shows that using 30 drops of a combination product providing lemon balm, spearmint, and coriander (Carmint, PurSina Pharmacy) three times daily after meals for 8 weeks reduces abdominal pain and discomfort when added to standard treatment with loperamide or psyllium, compared to standard treatment alone (19535). It is not known if the effect is due to lemon balm, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral lemon balm has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults with sleep disturbances shows that taking lemon balm leaf 250 mg and fennel fruit 250 mg orally once daily for 8 weeks improves menopausal symptoms including vasomotor, psychomotor-social, physical, and sexual symptoms, by 24% to 38% when compared with baseline. These improvements were significant when compared with placebo (110137).\nless\nPain (acute). It is unclear if lemon balm aromatherapy is beneficial for reducing pain in patients with acute coronary syndrome.\nA small clinical study in patients with acute coronary syndrome presenting to the emergency department shows that aromatherapy with lemon balm leaf and stem essential oil 1% for 10 minutes twice on the day of presentation modestly reduces chest pain scores when compared with placebo. However, pain was no longer different between groups within 15 minutes after the second aromatherapy session (110139).\nless\nPostpartum complications. Oral lemon balm might reduce postpartum pain in some patients; however, it's not clear if it is beneficial for other postpartum complications.\nA small clinical study shows that taking lemon balm leaf extract 395 mg every 6 hours for 24 hours following childbirth is slightly more effective for reducing postpartum pain when compared with taking mefenamic acid 250 mg using the same dosing schedule (101763).\nless\nPsoriasis. Oral lemon balm has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with mild to moderate psoriasis shows that taking an oral combination product containing lemon balm, rose hip, and fennel as 10 mL three times daily for 12 weeks improves pruritus and psoriasis scores by 45% and 49%, respectively, when compared with baseline. In contrast, these scores worsened in the placebo group (110141). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of statistical comparison between groups.\nless\nSomatic symptom disorder. Oral lemon balm has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in individuals with somatic symptom disorder shows that taking one tablet of a combination product three times daily for 2 weeks seems to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety when compared with placebo. Each tablet of this product contains lemon balm leaf extract 60 mg, valerian root extract 90 mg, and passionflower herb extract 90 mg (19701). It is not known if the effect is due to lemon balm, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nVentricular arrhythmias. It is unclear if oral lemon balm leaf tea is beneficial for patients with premature ventricular contraction (PVC).\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with low to moderate PVCs shows that drinking lemon balm leaf tea twice daily for 12 weeks reduces the frequency of PVCs by 32% when compared with baseline. This improvement was significant when compared with no treatment. Lemon balm tea also modestly improved heart rate, but not left ventricular ejection fraction, when compared with no treatment. The tea was prepared by steeping lemon balm leaf 2 grams in 250 mL of boiling water (110140).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate lemon balm for these uses.",

Fresh leaves appear to contain more essential oil than dried leaves (59337). The harvest cut height appears to influence the oil content of lemon balm herb, with highest oil content found in the top third of the plant (59329).\n\nLemon balm extract used in clinical research is often standardized to rosmarinic acid content. One specific lemon balm extract (Cyracos, Naturex SA) is standardized to contain more than 7% rosmarinic acid and more than 15% hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (19529). Another lemon balm extract (Bluenesse, Vital Solutions) obtained by using dried leaves is standardized to contain 6% rosmarinic acid (91733).",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of lemon balm are the leaf and leaf oil. Lemon balm contains citronellal, neral, and geranial monoterpenoid aldehydes; flavonoids (including luteolin) and polyphenol compounds (including rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, and tannins); monoterpene glycosides, and triterpenoids (including oleanolic acid and ursolic acid) (9994, 59327, 59357, 59358, 59362, 59394, 59395, 59404). The essential oil of lemon balm contains terpenes, mainly oxygenated monoterpenes, such as citronellal, neral, and geranial, and sesquiterpenoids (10422, 59370, 101764, 110139).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that the lemon balm constituent rosmarinic acid, given orally, reduces cobra venom factor-induced paw edema and inhibits passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The anti-inflammatory effect of rosmarinic acid is attributed to its ability to inhibit complement-dependent processes involved in inflammation (59390).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research shows that lemon balm can inhibit the growth of several clinically relevant Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains (59339, 59441, 59442, 59478). Because irritable bowel syndrome has been associated with intestinal dysbiosis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, it is thought that the antibacterial effects of lemon balm may contribute to its effects against this condition (94122). Other in vitro research shows that lemon balm has antibiofilm activity (59384).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research shows that lemon balm reduces blood glucose, improves glucose tolerance, and increases insulin levels in diabetic mice. This effect is attributed to the ability of lemon balm to enhance the uptake and metabolism of glucose in the liver and adipose tissue and to inhibit gluconeogenesis in the liver (19724).\nAntifungal effects\nSome in vitro research shows that lemon balm inhibits the growth of the fungal species Candida albicans (59364). Other in vitro research shows that lemon balm inhibits the growth of many yeast species (59333, 59402).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn vitro research shows that lemon balm essential oil and lemon balm leaf extract inhibits the proliferation of several human cancer cell lines (59340, 59446, 94123).\nAntinociceptive effects\nAnimal research shows that lemon balm extract, given orally, reduces acetic acid-induced visceral pain, formalin-induced neurogenic pain and inflammatory pain, and glutamate-induced pain. This effect is attributed to the ability of lemon balm extract to inhibit the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway and to activate nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (59359).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that lemon balm has antioxidant activity and can inhibit lipid peroxidation (19724, 58045, 59327). The antioxidant activity of lemon balm is attributed to its polyphenol compounds (59327, 59343).\nAntiprotozoal effects\nIn vitro research shows that lemon balm essential oil has antiprotozoal effects against Trypanosoma species, including Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi (59326, 59418).\nAntithyroid effects\nIn vitro, constituents of lemon balm extract bind to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which prevents TSH receptor-binding and leads to the inhibition of TSH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (19727, 19728, 37367). In animals, lemon balm extract has been show to decrease levels of circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and inhibited thyroid secretion (19726).\nAntiviral effects\nResearch shows that injecting eggs with lemon balm leaf extract prior to infection protects against Newcastle disease virus, vaccinia, Semliki Forest virus, and herpes simplex virus (59393, 59447). The antiviral activity of lemon balm is attributed to its tannin and polyphenol constituents (59393, 59394, 59395). Other in vitro research shows that aqueous extract of lemon balm has both virucidal and antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (59404). Lemon balm volatile oils have also been shown to inhibit the replication of HSV-2 in vitro (59344). In vitro research also shows that lemon balm extract has antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (59406). Lemon balm extract does not appear to protect against influenza A or influenza B virus when injected into eggs (59393). However, other in vitro research shows that the addition of lemon balm essential oil to inoculated cells protects against influenza A virus (H9N2), with the most benefit seen when the oil is added prior to virus inoculation. While the mechanism of this effect remains unclear, in vitro research suggests a possible additive antiviral effect when lemon balm essential oil is used in combination with oseltamivir (95649).\nCardiovascular effects\nLemon balm extract has been shown to reduce cardiac rate in isolated rat hearts without affecting contractile force. It is thought that lemon balm may stimulate cardiac muscarinic receptors (59341).\nDermatologic effects\nCompared to an ethanol-water extract from dried plant, centrifuged lemon balm from fresh leaves and stems has shown protective effects against skin irritation, as evidenced by the inhibited release of pro-inflammatory mediators and the maintenance of both cell viability and trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in a reconstituted human epidermis model (59360).\nFood preservation effects\nLemon balm has been shown to prevent the hardening of pork meat that is cooked and packaged. This activity is attributed to the antioxidant effects of lemon balm (59377). Also, lemon balm appears to extend the shelf-life of lipid-containing foods such as sunflower oil. This effect is attributed to polyphenol compounds of lemon balm that have antioxidant activity (59417). Lemon balm also appears to extend the shelf-life of food by inhibiting the growth of food-spoilage bacteria (59412, 59423, 59425).\nImmune effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that lemon balm extract has immunostimulating effects (59338).\nLipid effects\nAnimal research shows that lemon balm essential oil decreases total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels in cholesterol-fed rabbits. The hypocholesterolemic effect of lemon balm is attributed to the constituent geraniol, which has been shown to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase (59426). A meta-analysis of small heterogeneous clinical trials in healthy patients and in patients with various disease states such as type 2 diabetes and chronic angina suggests that taking lemon balm orally might modestly reduce levels of total cholesterol, but not LDL cholesterol or triglycerides, when compared with placebo (104434).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nLemon balm contains citronellal, neral, and geranial monoterpenoid aldehydes; flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds (including rosmarinic acid); and monoterpene glycosides. These substances may contribute to the behavioral effects of lemon balm dried leaf and essential oil (9994). Some research suggests lemon balm might have acetylcholine receptor activity with both nicotinic and muscarinic binding properties (9994, 19530). Clinical research suggests that lemon balm induces a calming effect and reduces alertness (9994). Cholinergic modulation appears to play a role in the effect of lemon balm on memory and alertness (91733). Preliminary clinical research shows that lemon balm may induce anxiolytic effects that can help reduce symptomatic palpitations (91732). Other clinical research suggests that lemon balm, when given along with valerian, passion flower, and butterbur, can lower subjective anxiety scores during a social stress test in men, but without an associated alteration in salivary cortisol levels (97276). Animal research shows that lemon balm has dose-dependent sedative effects (19725).\n\nLemon balm is used in aromatherapy. The essential oil of lemon balm contains terpenes, which are rapidly absorbed through the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier. In addition, these may possess cholinergic activity or act on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (10422, 59350, 59351, 59355).\nWeight loss effects\nPreliminary research in animals shows that taking a specific combination of herbs (Ob-X) containing lemon balm, white mulberry, and yin chen reduces body weight, visceral adipose tissue mass, total cholesterol, and triglycerides in obese mice (14618, 59363, 59382). It is thought that this herbal combination reduces the growth and development of adipose tissue that contributes to obesity by inhibiting angiogenesis (59363, 59382)."

The 75% lemon eucalyptus oil preparation does not appear to be more effective than the lower 40% concentration (13065). Lemon eucalyptus oil 30% seems to be comparable to DEET 15% (13076). A towelette wipe providing lemon eucalyptus oil 0.574 grams seems to be comparable to DEET 15% lotion (13081).\n\nLemon eucalyptus oil might provide a shorter duration of protection than DEET. Lemon eucalyptus oil 30%, 40%, or 50% seems to provide complete protection for a duration of 1-5 hours (13074, 13076, 13117, 13118).

Other constituents isolated from lemon eucalyptus include eucalyptin, beta-sitosterol, and triterpenoids (13064).\nAnti-fungal effects\nIn vitro, lemon eucalyptus oil has demonstrated significant antifungal activity (13064, 95250). Lemon eucalyptus oil is active against fungal microorganisms that cause onychomycosis such as Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Epidermophyton stockdale (13447).\nAntidiabetes effects\nIn vitro research shows that lemon eucalyptus leaf extract increases mouse islet cell insulin secretion. Animal research in obese rats shows that taking lemon eucalyptus leaf extract 250 mg/kg orally for 1-9 days improves plasma insulin and glucose levels when compared with control (112191).\nMosquito-repellant effects\nConstituents of lemon eucalyptus, such as citronellal, are converted to p-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD), which has mosquito repellent activity. Commercial lemon eucalyptus oil-based mosquito repellents contain this constituent (13065). PMD consists of four stereoisomers, which each appear to have equal insect repellent activity (13116).

It is unclear if inhaling lemon verbena essential oil as aromatherapy reduces anxiety.\nA moderate sized clinical trial in patients awaiting caesarian section shows that inhaling lemon verbena essential oil as aromatherapy 30 minutes before surgery reduces pre-operative anxiety, heart rate, respiration rate, and blood pressure when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo (112295).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. Small clinical studies suggest that oral lemon verbena leaf extract may reduce muscle damage after exercise.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking lemon verbena leaf extract (Recoverben, BioTeSys GmbH) 400 mg orally daily for 10 days prior to an exercise stress test and continued for 4 days after can attenuate the increase in creatine kinase (CK) caused by muscle damage, reduce perceived muscle soreness, and decrease time to full muscle strength recovery when compared with placebo (97288). Similar research in healthy, young adults shows that taking another lemon verbena leaf extract (Planox, Hanseler AG), 400 mg orally daily for 10 days prior to exhaustive exercise and for 3 days after, reduces muscle damage, pain, and plasma levels of creatine kinase and interleukin-6 when compared with placebo (109668).\nless\nInsomnia. Small studies suggest that oral lemon verbena leaf extract or essential oil may modestly improve some measures of sleep quality in adults with insomnia.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adults with insomnia shows that taking a syrup containing lemon verbena leaf essential oil one hour before bedtime each night for 4 weeks improves sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) by 81%, compared with 8% in those taking placebo. Insomnia severity measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) improved by 91% with lemon verbena, compared with 19% in the placebo group. These improvements were not significant after only 2 weeks, suggesting that consistent use over at least 4 weeks is needed to obtain maximum benefit (104202). In other clinical research in young, healthy adults, taking lemon verbena leaf extract 400 mg orally daily, 1-2 hours before bedtime for 8 weeks, decreases PSQI scores by about 12% at 8 weeks, and by 20% after a further 4-week washout period, when compared with baseline.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of lemon verbena.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of lemon verbena are the leaf and flowering tops. Water-based extracts of lemon verbena are high in polyphenols, including flavone diglucuronides and verbascoside, a phenylpropanoid glycoside (97288, 97289). The essential oil of lemon verbena leaf contains caryophyllene, limonene, and linalool (104202).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe lemon verbena constituent, verbascoside, is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. In clinical research, lemon verbena extract intake was associated with a reduction in interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) levels in relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and a reduction in interleukin-12 (IL-12) levels in relapsing-remitting MS. It was also associated with an increase in the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in secondary progressive MS. No changes were seen in IL-6, IL-23, or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) levels (97289).\nAnti-obesity effects\nThere is some interest in the use of lemon verbena polyphenolic extracts to reduce appetite in obese individuals. In clinical research, a combination product containing lemon verbena and hibiscus extracts, standardized to contain 15% verbascoside, was associated with an increase in satiety and a reduction in hunger. Additionally, the combination product was associated with preventing an increase in plasma levels of ghrelin, which stimulates hunger, and increasing plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which increases satiety. No changes were seen in levels of insulin, C-peptide, or fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) (97290).\nAntimicrobial effects\nThe essential oil distilled from the lemon verbena leaf, referred to as oil of verbena, may have bactericidal effects (6). In vitro research shows that lemon verbena essential oil can inhibit the growth of bacterial cells, rupture bacterial cell membranes, and prevent or reduce the formation of biofilms through inhibition of secretion of extracellular polysaccharide by bacteria (112296).\nAntiparasitic effects\nThe essential oil distilled from the lemon verbena leaf, referred to as oil of verbena, may have activity against mites and ticks (acari) (6).\nErgogenic effects\nA small study in healthy adults shows that taking lemon verbena leaf extract (Planox, Hanseler AG), 400 mg orally daily for 10 days prior to exhaustive exercise and for 3 days after, reduces muscle damage and muscle pain and reduces plasma levels of creatine kinase and interleukin-6. It also reduces levels of urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, a measure of oxidative stress, and increases plasma glutathione peroxidase, which protects against oxidative damage (109668).\nGastroprotective effects\nResearch in animals with indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers shows that treatment with single 200 mg/kg intraperitoneal doses of aqueous or ethanolic extracts of lemon verbena leaf reduces the ulcer index, and decreases levels of malondialdehyde, a marker of oxidative stress, in gastric tissue. The increase in the percentage of blood neutrophils seen with indomethacin is also decreased by the extracts. Verbascoside, a constituent of lemon verbena extracts, reduces myeloperoxidase and lipoxygenase activity, which reduces free radical production in neutrophils, and reduces synthesis of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes in the gastric mucosa (109667).\nIrritant effects\nTerpene-rich volatile oils in the lemon verbena plant are considered irritants (4).\nNeurologic effects\nThe essential oil of lemon verbena leaf contains linalool and caryophyllene, which have demonstrated sedative effects in laboratory research, and limonene, which has demonstrated activity at serotonin receptors (104202). There is interest in using lemon verbena for insomnia. Proposed mechanisms of action include activity of verbascoside at GABA-A benzodiazepine receptors and inhibition of histamine stimulation (104202, 109669)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of lemongrass is the leaf and essential oil, or the whole plant. Lemongrass leaves are often used as \"lemon\" flavoring in herbal teas. Lemongrass essential oil constituents depend on geographic location of the plant (93955). The essential oil from lemongrass contains geraniol, limonene, alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, verbenene, and alpha-terpineole (2130, 7162, 93949, 93952, 93954). Lemongrass essential oil also contains citral, consisting of the isomers geranial and neral 65-85% (11, 7162, 93949, 93952, 93955). Extracts of the leaf contain mainly monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and phenolic acids (93953).\nAnalgesic effects\nAnimal research suggests that lemongrass has analgesic properties (11, 59487, 59598, 59650). Some researchers suggest that lemongrass might induce the release of endogenous opioids (59650). Additional evidence suggests that the lemongrass constituent myrcene might play a role in the analgesic effects of lemongrass (59598).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLemongrass is traditionally used for pain and swelling. In animal models of inflammation, lemongrass essential oil reduced swelling and inflammatory responses (59548, 93949). Laboratory research suggests that this may be due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of constituents such as flavonoids or citral (59536, 59615, 59644, 59669).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research suggests that lemongrass extract inhibits the growth of cancer cells. The antioxidant effects of lemongrass constituents are believed to explain its potential anticancer activity (93953). Citral, a constituent in lemongrass, also appears to induce apoptosis of cancer cells (13430).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nLemongrass essential oil is traditionally used for anxiety and seizures. In animal research, lemongrass essential oil had anticonvulsant effects (59599, 59666, 93955).\nAntimalarial effects\nAnimal research suggests that lemongrass essential oil and an extract of the whole plant have antimalarial activity against the malaria parasite (59556, 93951).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn laboratory research, lemongrass essential oil was found to have antimicrobial activity against a variety of common Gram positive and Gram negative organisms, including Acinetobacter calcoacetica, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter pylori, and others. It was also shown to have activity against certain amoebas, fungi, and yeasts such as Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Aspergillus niger (2131, 59523, 93946, 93949, 93950, 93955). The high citral content of lemongrass essential oil might play a role (93946, 93955).\nAntioxidant effects\nLemongrass is thought to have antioxidant properties (11, 59353, 59560). Citral, as well as the flavonoid or phenolic constituents of lemongrass, including caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and luteolin derivatives all have antioxidant effects (59519, 59604). In a rat model of diabetes, lemongrass essential oil and its constituent citral exhibited antioxidant potential via DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (115050). The antioxidant effects of lemongrass might play a role in some of the purported clinical uses.\nAntiprotozoal effects\nIn laboratory research, lemongrass essential oil and the constituent citral had antiprotozoal effects against Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania species (59602, 59628, 59645).\nAntipyretic effects\nLemongrass is commonly used to treat fever. It is thought to have antipyretic properties (11).\nAnxiolytic effects\nLemongrass essential oil is traditionally used for anxiety and seizures. In animal research, lemongrass essential oil had anxiolytic effects. It was suggested that lemongrass constituents acted via the GABAA receptor-benzodiazepine complex (59599, 93952).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nSome lemongrass essential oil preparations contains around 65% to 85% citral. Although citral is a CNS depressant (11, 7162), lemongrass does not seem to have significant CNS effects (2612).\nDental effects\nThere is interest in using lemongrass for periodontal disease. Preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that using lemongrass oil 2% mouthwash once increases salivary pH when compared with baseline (110621). It has also been proposed that compounds in lemongrass such as citronellal, citral, D-limonene, linalool and geraniol may have antibacterial and antibiofilm activity which could potentially decrease plaque formation, thereby reducing the risk of gingivitis and periodontal disease (112153).\nDrug metabolism effects\nIn animal research, lemongrass essential oil, as well as the lemongrass constituent citral, significantly induces uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT) activity and significantly inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4 and 1A1 activity. Lemongrass essential oil and citral were not associated with an alteration in the activity of cytochrome P450 2C9, 1A2, 2D6, 2E1, or 2B1 (97051).\nHepatoprotective effects\nThere is some interest in the use of lemongrass to protect against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity. However, in an animal model of APAP overdose, neither lemongrass essential oil nor the lemongrass constituent citral were associated with a reduction in markers of APAP-induced liver damage, including liver enzyme levels, hepatic glutathione levels, or hepatic glutathione peroxidase activity. Lemongrass essential oil and citral were associated with a reduced level of oxidized gluthathione and reactive oxygen species, as well as increased glutathione reductase activity; however, these changes did not minimize APAP-induced hepatotoxicity (97051). In a rat model of diabetes, lemongrass essential oil and the constituent citral showed a reduction in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels (115050).\nHypoglycemic effects\nLemongrass is traditionally used for diabetes. Blood glucose lowering properties of lemongrass leaf extract, lemongrass essential oil, and its constituent citral have been reported in animal models (59597, 115050).\nInsect repellent effects\nLemongrass essential oil has shown larvicidal and repellant effects in mosquitoes (43427, 59594, 93956). Lemongrass essential oil also has insect repellent effects against the sandfly, a carrier of protozoa (93954).\nLipid effects\nResearch suggests that lemongrass leaf extract reduces levels of cholesterol (59597), but the lipid effects of lemongrass have not been demonstrated in humans (59670). In a rat model of diabetes, lemongrass essential oil reduced low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels (115050).\nUterine effects\nLemongrass is thought to have uterine and menstrual flow stimulating effects (12)."

            "Effectiveness": "POSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nMalignant pleural effusions. Two meta-analyses of low to moderate quality randomized controlled trials in patients with malignant pleural effusions show that combining lentinan intrapleural infusion therapy with cisplatin increases clinical response when compared with cisplatin alone (103368, 103369). One meta-analysis of 54 studies shows that including lentinan treatment increases the likelihood of a complete response by 68%, based on the absence of pleural effusion for at least 4 weeks, when compared with cisplatin alone (103369). Another meta-analysis of 17 studies including at least 60 patients each shows that including lentinan increases the likelihood of clinical response by approximately 47%, based on either a complete response or an improvement of at least 50% maintained for at least 4 weeks (103368). Both analyses also show that there is a reduction in the risk of treatment failure and an improvement in quality of life when lentinan is added to cisplatin treatment (103368, 103369). Although one meta-analysis shows that adding lentinan reduces some, but not all, adverse effects of cisplatin, the other shows that adding lentinan does not affect the incidence of adverse effects (103369). Lentinan was used in doses of 1-10 mg, 1-3 times weekly, with 1-8 total doses (103368, 103369).\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In patients with acute exacerbation of COPD requiring ventilator support, clinical research shows that taking lentinan (Jinling Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 0.5 grams twice daily orally in combination with budesonide 1 mg twice daily for 4 days reduces the time on mechanical ventilation by about 1 day, as well as the length of stay in the intensive care unit by about 2.5 days, when compared with budesonide alone (103367).\nEsophageal cancer. One small clinical study in adults with esophageal cancer shows that adding intravenous lentinan to chemotherapy treatment with tegafur, a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, improves quality of life when compared with chemotherapy alone. These improvements were greater in the second course of treatment, with approximately twice as many patients achieving partial remission or experiencing improvement (96867).\nGastric cancer. Preliminary clinical research shows that administering lentinan by injection as adjunctive treatment seems to improve response in patients being treated for gastric cancer (1108, 1110, 1113, 96862). Also, a meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research shows that lentinan approximately doubles the odds of having improved clinical efficacy when added to the FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen in patients with gastric cancer. The odds of a favorable change in performance status improved 3.2-fold over FOLFOX alone. Lentinan also reduced the odds of developing leukopenia or having a gastrointestinal reaction to FOLFOX (96862). However, clinical research suggests that lentinan reduces survival time when used in combination with tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil for unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer (96864). These disparate findings might be related to the chemotherapy regimen used or the stage of cancer being treated.\nHIV/AIDS. Preliminary clinical research shows that administering lentinan by injection once weekly for 56 weeks, in combination with didanosine by mouth, increases CD4 counts when compared with didanosine alone (1107).\nLung cancer. Meta-analyses of preliminary clinical research shows that lentinan injection increases the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer (96863, 96865). In patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the objective response rate was improved by 31% over chemotherapy alone. However, lentinan did not improve the response to navelbine with cisplatin in a sub-group analysis. Lentinan also reduced serious chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal reactions by 46% and granulocytopenia by 35% (96865). In patients with advanced lung cancer, the overall response was increased by 33% (96863). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nProstate cancer. One small clinical study in men with metastatic prostate cancer shows that administering lentinan by injection as 2 mg weekly or 4 mg every other week, in conjunction with hormonal therapy and chemotherapy with tegafur, a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, improves 5-year survival rate when compared with Tegafur alone (1109).\nQuality of life.

It is found naturally in fermented foods, cheese, and in humans. Specific strains are found as probiotics in supplements and functional foods. Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90238, 90605, 101513, 110952). Probiotics are often marketed for various purposes, including allergies and gastrointestinal health.",
            "Warnings": "In April 2020, the genus Lactobacillus was reclassified into 25 different genera (101513). L. brevis, which was previously classified under the Lactobacillus genus, was reclassified under the Levilactobacillus genus. However, some product labels may still identify this species as Lactobacillus brevis.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, there is no evidence that L. brevis is beneficial for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",

Although there has been interest in using oral Levilactobacillus brevis for alcohol-related liver disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Levilactobacillus brevis for this condition.\nBacterial vaginosis. Oral or vaginal Levilactobacillus brevis have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with bacterial vaginosis cured within the past 48 hours shows that taking a product containing L. brevis in combination with other probiotics results in recurrence of vaginosis in 18.3% of patients, a statistically significant reduction compared with 32.1% of those taking placebo. The mean time to recurrence was approximately 23 days longer in patients taking the lactobacilli. The product contained L. brevis 1.08 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lactobacillus acidophilus 1.08 billion CFUs, and Lactobacillus crispatus LMG S-29995 3.24 billion CFUs (Lactogyn, Vésale Pharma, Belgium), and was taken twice daily for 7 days and then once daily for up to an additional 120 days (110950). A preliminary clinical trial shows that vaginal application with a tablet providing at least one billion colony-forming units of a combination of L. brevis, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and Ligilactobacillus salivarius (Florisia) might be beneficial for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Using this combination for 8 days reduces the proportion of patients with bacterial vaginosis by about 79% when compared with baseline. Taking this product does not seem to be more beneficial than using a pH lowering vaginal product (110951).\nless\nBehcet disease. It is unclear if oral Levilactobacillus brevis is beneficial for oral ulcers in patients with Behcet disease.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with Behcet disease shows that taking lozenges containing an unknown amount of L. brevis (Inersan, VSL Pharmaceuticals) six times daily for 7 days reduces the average number of oral ulcers by about 1.5 when compared with baseline. Benefits lasted for at least one week after treatment was stopped (110959). This trial is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nCommon cold. It is unclear if oral Levilactobacillus brevis is beneficial for the common cold.\nPreliminary clinical research in school children shows that consuming a commercially available probiotic test drink (Kagome) containing L. brevis KB290 6 billion colony-forming units per bottle five days per week for 8 weeks does not appear to reduce the incidence of common cold when compared with not consuming the drink (90238).\nless\nDental caries. It is unclear if oral Levilactobacillus brevis is beneficial for caries prevention.\nClinical research in children aged 4-14 years at risk of dental caries shows that taking lozenges containing L. brevis CD2 (Inersan, CD Investments srl) 2 billion colony-forming units twice daily for up to 60 days modestly reduces bleeding on probing when compared with taking a placebo lozenge. However, the effect of taking L. brevis on the prevention of dental caries was not investigated (110953, 110958).\nless\nDry skin. It is unclear if topical Levilactobacillus brevis extract is beneficial for dry skin.\nA small clinical trial shows that topical application with a cream providing a water-soluble non-viable extract of L. brevis 0.88 mg twice daily to the leg for 4 weeks modestly reduces symptoms such as scaling, roughness, redness, and cracking when compared with baseline. The proportions of patients experiencing a reduction in skin roughness, redness, scaling, and skin dryness were increased numerically when compared with placebo; however, it is unclear which differences are statistically or clinically significant (110955).\nless\nGenital herpes. It is unclear if intravaginal Levilactobacillus brevis is beneficial for genital herpes.\nA small preliminary clinical trial in adults with acute recurrent genital herpes shows that applying a specific capsule containing 3 different L. brevis strains into the vagina twice daily for 6 months resolves symptoms after 4.4 days, compared with 3 days in those taking acyclovir 400 mg twice daily. The difference between groups was not significant; however, the study may not have been large enough to detect a difference between groups. The dose used was 2 billion colony-forming units of L. brevis strain CD2 (Inersan, VSL Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), L. brevis strain KB290 (Japan Collection of Microorganisms: JCM 17312), and L. brevis strain SBC8803 (Frontier Laboratories of Value Creation Sapporo Breweries) twice daily (99787). The validity of these findings is unclear due to the use of an acyclovir dose that is typically intended for prevention, but not treatment, of acute genital herpes.\nless\nGingivitis. Although there has been interest in using oral Levilactobacillus brevis for gingivitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Levilactobacillus brevis for this condition.\nInfluenza. It is unclear if oral Levilactobacillus brevis is beneficial for influenza prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research in school children shows that consuming a commercially available probiotic test drink (Kagome) containing heat-killed L. brevis KB290 6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) per bottle five days per week for 8 weeks during flu season reduces the incidence of influenza from 24% in the non-test drink group to 16% in the test drink group (90238). A large clinical trial in healthy Japanese adults shows that drinking 200 mL of a beverage containing L. brevis KB290 at least 10 billion CFUs and beta-carotene 7.4-12.4 mg daily for 12 weeks during influenza season does not reduce the risk of influenza or fever when compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients under 40 years of age, the risk of influenza was reduced by around 53% when compared with placebo (107287). It is unclear if these findings are due to L. brevis, beta-carotene, or the combination.\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral Levilactobacillus brevis is beneficial for insomnia.\nA small preliminary clinical trial in adults with poor sleep quality shows that taking heat-killed L. brevis SBC8803 25 mg daily for 10 days modestly reduces periods of waking based on sleep diaries when compared with placebo. However, other subjective or objective measures of sleep quality were not significantly improved (110963). This study was small and may have been underpowered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral Levilactobacillus brevis is beneficial for IBS.\nA small clinical trial in patients aged 6 years and up with IBS shows that taking L. brevis KB290 at least 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 4 weeks does not improve IBS symptoms, such as number of bowel movements per week, volume of feces, or physical sensations, when compared with taking placebo. However, frequency of abdominal pain was modestly reduced when compared with taking placebo and there was a modest improvement in the frequency of watery or mushy feces when compared with baseline (110941). A small clinical trial in healthy adults with minor diarrhea-predominant IBS-like symptoms shows that taking a combination of L. brevis KB290 at least 25.7 billion cells including at least 10 billion CFUs, along with beta-carotene 4.0-4.5 mg, daily for 12 weeks modestly improves the intensity of abdominal pain and reduces stool frequency when compared with taking placebo. There were no differences between groups in improvements in stool consistency, incomplete evacuation, or other symptoms (110960). Although this study included adults with diarrhea-predominant IBS-like symptoms, patients diagnosed with IBS were excluded, limiting the generalizability of the study.\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral Levilactobacillus brevis is beneficial for oral mucositis.\nClinical research in patients with head and neck cancer shows that taking a lozenge containing L. brevis CD2 two billion colony-forming units six times daily from the first day of radiation/chemotherapy and until one week after treatment reduces the relative proportion of patients with grade III and IV oral mucositis by about 30% when compared with placebo. However, the proportion of patients that develop grade I or II mucositis is similar (90290). However, preliminary clinical research in patients receiving radiotherapy shows that taking these same lozenges during the same time frame does not reduce the incidence or grade of severe oral mucositis or the need for enteral nutrition when compared with use of a sodium bicarbonate mouthwash three times daily (110956).\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral or topical Levilactobacillus brevis are beneficial for periodontitis.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking lozenges containing L. brevis (VSL Pharmaceuticals) 200 mg four times daily for four days improves or results in a complete recovery of clinical parameters including gingival inflammation, plaque, calculus, temperature sensitivity, and bleeding, when compared with baseline (110957). However, this study is limited by the lack of a control group. A small clinical trial in patients undergoing scaling and root planing shows that a single topical application with a gel containing a combination of L. brevis (CECT7480) and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (CECT7481) into the periodontal pocket, followed by taking one lozenge containing these probiotics daily for 3 months, does not reduce the number of diseased sites when compared with placebo. Although there was a two-fold increased odds of healing of gingival bleeding in patients using the probiotic product, the odds of having persisting diseased sites was modestly increased. The gel provided 6 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each of L. brevis and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. One lozenge provided 1.2 billion CFUs of each (110961).\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral Levilactobacillus brevis has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking probiotics containing L. brevis during pregnancy reduces the severity and duration of nausea and vomiting by 16% to 54%. There was also a small benefit on stool hardness. A specific probiotic (Probiotics 10, Nature's Bounty) was taken as 2 capsules daily for two back-to-back cycles of six days with probiotics and two days without.

It is unclear if oral Levilactobacillus brevis is beneficial for prevention of traumatic oral ulcers.\nA small clinical trial in patients aged 14 years and older shows that taking L. brevis CD2 (BioGrowing Co., Ltd, China) as soluble tablets providing four billion colony-forming units three times daily for 21 days starting the day of fixed orthodontic appliance placement reduces the number of days with lesions by 2.4 days or about 50%, and modestly reduces pain, when compared with taking placebo. However, quality of life was not improved (110962).\nless\nVaginal candidiasis.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLevilactobacillus brevis is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. It is found naturally in humans, as well as in some fermented foods. L. brevis is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90238, 90605, 101513, 110952). Most researchers agree that the effectiveness of L. brevis and other probiotics for all indications depends on its ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome strains of Levilactobacillus brevis produce high levels of the enzyme, arginine deiminase. Researchers have suggested that this enzyme competes with the enzyme nitric oxide synthase in the body, resulting in a reduction in levels of some inflammatory mediators. Inhibition of arginine deiminase has been shown in vitro using L. brevis extracts (90290, 110954, 110957). Anti-inflammatory effects of live L. brevis or L. brevis extracts have been shown in both laboratory and human research (110951, 110952, 110955, 110960).\nDermatologic effects\nLevilactobacillus brevis is of interest for skin health. In human skin cells in vitro, L. brevis extract has anti-inflammatory effects. In vitro, and when applied topically to the skin, L. brevis stimulates the growth of Staphylococcus epidermis and other normal microbiota of human skin (110955).\nOral health effects\nAlthough not all human research has found beneficial effects, Levilactobacillus brevis is of interest for oral health, specifically prevention of dental caries, as well as for the treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis. Research in patients with periodontitis has found that taking lozenges containing L. brevis reduces salivary levels of nitrite and nitrate, as well as inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 and interferon-gamma in saliva, and proteinases such as matrix metalloproteinases (110957). These benefits were also shown in vitro in the presence of L. brevis extracts, suggesting that taking live L. brevis is not required (110957).\n\nSome human research shows that taking L. brevis reduces levels of cariogenic bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans (110953, 110958). However, other human research suggests that taking L. brevis does not affect levels of oral L. brevis or pathogenic bacteria (110961).\n\nAnimal research suggests that L. brevis might inhibit periodontal bone loss. In an animal model of periodontitis, placing L. brevis around the gums decreased levels of oral inflammatory mediators and anaerobic bacteria, and reduced bone loss (110954).\nProbiotic effects\nIn human research, oral Levilactobacillus brevis increased levels of intestinal Bifidobacterium and decreased levels of Clostridium. However, there was no effect on levels of lactobacilli, Bacteroides, or Enterobacter (110941).\nRespiratory effects\nLevilactobacillus brevis is of interest for the prevention of respiratory infections. In human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, L. brevis BGZLS10-17 had anti-inflammatory effects (110952).\nVaginal effects\nLactic acid bacteria are of interest for vaginal health. In human research, vaginal application of Levilactobacillus brevis decreased levels of some inflammatory mediators (110951)."

            "Overview": "Licorice is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean, southern and central Russia, and Asia Minor to Iran. However, various species of licorice are now cultivated throughout Europe, Asia, and the Middle East (25694). Licorice contains glycyrrhizin, or glycyrrhizic acid, which can cause a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess when eaten in large amounts (15600). However, licorice can be processed to remove the glycyrrhizin, resulting in DGL (deglycyrrhizinated licorice). Many \"licorice\" products manufactured in the US actually don't contain any licorice. Instead, they contain anise oil, which has the characteristic smell and taste of \"black licorice\" (90891).",
            "Warnings": "Licorice contains glycyrrhizin, or glycyrrhizic acid, which can cause a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess when eaten in large amounts. However, appropriate processing can remove the glycyrrhizin, resulting in DGL (deglycyrrhizinated licorice). Many \"licorice\" products manufactured in the US contain anise oil, instead of licorice, which provides the smell and taste of \"black licorice\" (15600, 90891).\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Some experts have warned that licorice might interfere with the body's immune and inflammatory response against COVID-19. There is no strong evidence to support these warnings. However, there is also no good evidence to support using licorice for COVID-19. Recommend healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Licorice has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when licorice products that do not contain glycyrrhizin (deglycyrrhizinated licorice) are used orally and appropriately for medicinal purposes. Licorice flavonoid oil 300 mg daily for 16 weeks, and deglycyrrhizinated licorice products in doses of up to 4.5 grams daily for up to 16 weeks, have been used with apparent safety (6196, 11312, 11313, 17727, 100984, 102960). ...when licorice products containing glycyrrhizin are used orally in low doses, short-term. Licorice extract 272 mg, containing glycyrrhizin 24.3 mg, has been used daily with apparent safety for 6 months (102961). A licorice extract 1000 mg, containing monoammonium glycyrrhizinate 240 mg, has been used daily with apparent safety for 12 weeks (110320). In addition, a syrup providing licorice extract 750 mg has been used twice daily with apparent safety for 5 days (104558). ...when applied topically. A gel containing 2% licorice root extract has been applied to the skin with apparent safety for up to 2 weeks. (59732). A mouth rinse containing 5% licorice extract has been used with apparent safety four times daily for up to one week (104564).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when licorice products containing glycyrrhizin are used orally in large amounts for several weeks, or in smaller amounts for longer periods of time. The European Scientific Committee on Food recommends that a safe average daily intake of glycyrrhizin should not exceed 10 mg (108577). In otherwise healthy people, consuming glycyrrhizin daily for several weeks or longer can cause severe adverse effects including pseudohyperaldosteronism, hypertensive crisis, hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Doses of 20 grams or more of licorice products, containing at least 400 mg glycyrrhizin, are more likely to cause these effects; however, smaller amounts have also caused hypokalemia and associated symptoms when taken for months to years (781, 3252, 15590, 15592, 15594, 15596, 15597, 15599, 15600, 16058)(59731, 59740, 59752, 59785, 59786, 59787, 59792, 59795, 59805, 59811)(59816, 59818, 59820, 59822, 59826, 59828, 59849, 59850, 59851, 59867)(59882, 59885, 59888, 59889, 59895, 59900, 59906, 97213, 110305). In patients with hypertension, cardiovascular or kidney conditions, or a high salt intake, as little as 5 grams of licorice product or 100 mg glycyrrhizin daily can cause severe adverse effects (15589, 15593, 15598, 15600, 59726).\nPREGNANCY: UNSAFE when used orally. Licorice has abortifacient, estrogenic, and steroid effects. It can also cause uterine stimulation. Heavy consumption of licorice, equivalent to 500 mg of glycyrrhizin per week (about 250 grams of licorice per week), during pregnancy seems to increase the risk of delivery before gestational age of 38 weeks (7619, 10618). Furthermore, high intake of glycyrrhizin, at least 500 mg per week, during pregnancy is associated with increased salivary cortisol levels in the child by the age of 8 years. This suggests that high intake of licorice during pregnancy may increase hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activity in the child (26434); avoid using.\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, licorice is generally well tolerated when used in amounts commonly found in foods. It seems to be well tolerated when licorice products that do not contain glycyrrhizin (deglycyrrhizinated licorice) are used orally and appropriately for medicinal purposes or when used topically, short-term.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nTopically: Contact dermatitis.\n\nIntravenously: Diarrhea, itching, nausea, and rash.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Case reports have raised concerns about acute renal failure, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, hypokalemia, muscle weakness, paralysis, pseudohyperaldosteronism, and seizure associated with long-term use or large amounts of licorice containing glycyrrhizin.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, excessive licorice ingestion can lead to pseudohyperaldosteronism, which can precipitate cardiovascular complications such as hypertension and hypertensive crisis, ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, sinus pause, and cardiac arrest. These effects are due to the licorice constituent glycyrrhizin and usually occur when 20-30 grams or more of licorice product is consumed daily for several weeks (781, 15590, 15592, 15594, 15596, 15597, 15599, 15600, 16835, 97213) (104563, 108574, 108576, 110305, 112234). In one case report, an 89-year-old female taking an herbal medicine containing licorice experienced a fatal arrhythmia secondary to licorice-induced hypokalemia. The patient presented to the hospital with recurrent syncope, weakness, and fatigue for 5 days after taking an herbal medicine containing licorice for 2 months. Upon admission to the hospital, the patient developed seizures, QT prolongation, and ventricular arrhythmia requiring multiple defibrillations. Laboratory tests confirmed hypokalemia and pseudohyperaldosteronism (112234).\n\nHowever, people with cardiovascular or kidney conditions may be more sensitive, so these adverse events may occur with doses as low as 5 grams of licorice product or glycyrrhizin 100 mg daily (15589, 15593, 15598, 15600, 59726). A case report in a 54-year-old male suggests that malnutrition might increase the risk of severe adverse effects with excessive licorice consumption. This patient presented to the emergency room with cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation after excessive daily consumption of licorice for about 3 weeks. This caused pseudohyperaldosteronism and then hypokalemia, leading to cardiovascular manifestations. In spite of resuscitative treatment, the patient progressed to kidney failure, refused dialysis, and died shortly thereafter (103791).\nless\nDermatologic\nThere have been reports of contact allergy, resulting in an itchy reddish eruption, occurring in patients that applied cosmetic products containing oil-soluble licorice extracts (59912). There have also been at least 3 cases of allergic contact dermatitis reported with the topical application of glycyrrhizin-containing products to damaged skin. In one case report, a 31-year-old female with acne presented with a 2-year history of pruritic erythematous-scaly plaques located predominantly on the face and neck after the use of a cosmetic product containing licorice root extract 1%. The patient had a positive skin patch test to licorice root extract, leading the clinicians to hypothesize that the use of benzoyl peroxide, a strong irritant, might have sensitized the patient to licorice (108578). Burning sensation, itching, redness, and scaling were reported rarely in patients applying a combination of licorice, calendula, and snail secretion filtrate to the face. The specific role of licorice is unclear (110322).\n\nIn rare cases, the glycyrrhizin constituent of licorice has caused rash and itching when administered intravenously (59712).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, excessive licorice ingestion can cause a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, or pseudohyperaldosteronism, with sodium and water retention, increased urinary potassium loss, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis due to its glycyrrhizin content (781, 10619, 15591, 15592, 15593, 15594, 15595, 15596, 15597, 15598)(15600, 16057, 16835, 25659, 25660, 25673, 25719, 26439, 59818, 59822)(59832, 59864, 91722, 104563, 108568, 108574, 110305, 112234). These metabolic abnormalities can lead to hypertension, edema, EKG changes, fatigue, syncope, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, headache, lethargy, muscle weakness, dropped head syndrome (DHS), rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, paralysis, encephalopathy, respiratory impairment, hyperparathyroidism, and acute kidney failure (10393, 10619, 15589, 15590, 15593, 15594, 15596, 15597, 15599)(15600, 16057, 16835, 25660, 25673, 25719, 26439, 31562, 59709, 59716)(59720, 59740, 59787, 59820, 59826, 59882, 59889, 59900, 91722, 97214, 100522) (104563, 108576, 108577). These effects are most likely to occur when 20-30 grams of licorice products containing glycyrrhizin 400 mg or more is consumed daily for several weeks (781, 15590, 15592, 15594, 15596, 15597, 15599, 15600, 16835, 108574). However, some people may be more sensitive, especially those with hypertension, diabetes, heart problems, or kidney problems (15589, 15593, 15598, 15600, 59726, 108576, 108577) and even low or moderate consumption of licorice may cause hypertensive crisis or hypertension in normotensive individuals (1372, 97213). The use of certain medications with licorice may also increase the risk of these adverse effects (108568, 108577). One case report determined that the use of large doses of licorice in an elderly female stabilized on fludrocortisone precipitated hypokalemia and hypertension, requiring inpatient treatment (108568). Another case report describes severe hypokalemia necessitating intensive care treatment due to co-ingestion of an oral glycyrrhizin-specific product and hydrochlorothiazide for 1 month (108577). Glycyrrhetinic acid has a long half-life, a large volume of distribution, and extensive enterohepatic recirculation. Therefore, it may take 1-2 weeks before hypokalemia resolves (781, 15595, 15596, 15597, 15600). Normalization of the renin-aldosterone axis and blood pressure can take up to several months (781, 15595, 108568). Treatment typically includes the discontinuation of licorice, oral and intravenous potassium supplementation, and short-term use of aldosterone antagonists, such as spironolactone (108574, 108577).\n\nChewing tobacco flavored with licorice has also been associated with toxicity. Chewing licorice-flavored tobacco, drinking licorice tea, or ingesting large amounts of black licorice flavored jelly beans or lozenges has been associated with hypertension and suppressed renin and aldosterone levels (12671, 12837, 97214, 97215, 97217, 108574). One case report suggests that taking a combination product containing about 100 mg of licorice and other ingredients (Jintan, Morishita Jintan Co.) for many decades may be associated with hypoaldosteronism, even up to 5 months after discontinuation of the product (100522). In another case report, licorice ingestion led to hyperprolactinemia in a female (59901). Licorice-associated hypercalcemia has also been noted in a case report (59766).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nNausea and vomiting have been reported rarely following oral use of deglycyrrhizinated licorice (25694, 59871).\n\nIntravenously, the glycyrrhizin constituent of licorice has rarely caused gastric discomfort, diarrhea, or nausea (59712, 59915).\nless\nImmunologic\nThere have been reports of contact allergy, resulting in an itchy reddish eruption, occurring in patients that applied cosmetic products containing oil-soluble licorice extracts (59912). There have also been at least 3 cases of allergic contact dermatitis reported with the topical application of glycyrrhizin-containing products to damaged skin.

The patient had a positive skin patch test to licorice root extract, leading the clinicians to hypothesize that the use of benzoyl peroxide, a strong irritant, might have sensitized the patient to licorice (108578).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIn a case report, excessive glycyrrhizin-containing licorice consumption led to water retention and was thought to trigger neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome (59791).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, licorice containing larger amounts of glycyrrhizin may cause headaches. A healthy woman taking glycyrrhizin 380 mg daily for 2 weeks experienced a headache (59892). Intravenously, the glycyrrhizin constituent of licorice has rarely caused headaches or fatigue (59721). In a case report, licorice candy ingestion was associated with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome accompanied by a tonic-clonic seizure (97218).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, consuming glycyrrhizin-containing licorice 114-909 grams has been associated with transient visual loss (59714).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, large amounts of licorice might lead to pulmonary edema. In one case report, a 64-year old male consumed 1020 grams of black licorice (Hershey Twizzlers) containing glycyrrhizin 3.6 grams over 3 days, which resulted in pulmonary edema secondary to pseudohyperaldosteronism (31561). Intravenously, the glycyrrhizin constituent of licorice has caused cold or flu-like symptoms, although these events are not common (59712, 59721).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Some clinical research suggests that topical licorice seems to improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis.\nApplying gel formulations containing 1% or 2% licorice root extract three times daily for 2 weeks seems to reduce erythema by 35% to 61%, edema by 57% to 84%, and itching by 44% to 73%. The 2% gel seems to be more effective than the 1% gel (59732).\nless\nCanker sores. Some clinical research suggests that topical licorice patches and mouth rinses seems to reduce ulcer size and pain in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis.\nClinical research shows that applying an oral patch containing licorice 0.015-0.229 mg/kg for 16 hours each day for 8 days does not affect ulcer healing time, but reduces ulcer size and post-stimulus pain, when compared with placebo (59769). A small clinical study also shows that applying bioadhesive hydrogel patches containing 1% licorice extract reduces the pain, as well as the diameter of necrosis and inflammatory halo of recurrent canker sores, when compared to baseline (59781). Mouth rinses containing licorice have also been used. One clinical study shows that swishing a diphenhydramine and 5% licorice extract solution around the mouth for about 3 minutes four times daily until the sores have healed reduces the average time to healing by 1.5 days when compared to a solution containing diphenhydramine alone. Pain was reduced by up to 69% more in those using licorice extract (104564). Another small clinical study shows that gargling with licorice extract four times daily for 2 days has a large beneficial effect on pain and ulcer size when compared with using a placebo gargle. The licorice extract was made by boiling licorice root 40 grams in one liter of water for 30 minutes and cooled (110319). In addition, preliminary clinical research shows that gargling with warm water containing deglycyrrhizinated licorice powder 200 mg four times daily for 7 days improves pain in 75% of patients by day one and results in complete healing in 75% of patients by day three (59857).\nless\nEndotracheal intubation-related adverse effects. Some clinical research suggests that using licorice as a gargle or lozenge prior to endotracheal intubation can reduce adverse effects like sore throat and cough.\nA meta-analysis of 5 clinical trials in patients undergoing elective surgical procedures shows that topical use of licorice, either as a gargle or lozenge, prior to endotracheal intubation reduces the risk for sore throat by 56% and reduces the risk for cough by 39% when compared with a control group at 24 hours post-extubation (100985). One clinical study included in this analysis shows that sucking on a single lozenge (Sualin, Hamdard Pharma) containing licorice extract 97 mg beginning 30 minutes prior to intubation reduces the risk for cough immediately after extubation by 56% when compared with a sugar candy lozenge. However, it doesn't seem to reduce cough at 30 minutes, 12 hours, or 24 hours post-extubation. This lozenge also appears to reduce the risk for sore throat by about 32% at 12 and 24 hours post-extubation, but not immediately or 30 minutes after extubation (25670). Additional clinical studies included in the meta-analysis show that gargling with fluid prepared with licorice 0.5 grams for at least one minute beginning 5 minutes prior to endotracheal intubation reduces the incidence and severity of post-extubation sore throat and coughing when compared with a water control (26464, 59793).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Topical licorice has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with mild to moderate acne associated with mask wearing shows that topical application of a combination of licorice root extract 0.3%, calendula 4%, and snail secretion filtrate 40% (AI complex) to the face twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces inflammatory, but not non-inflammatory or total, acne lesions when compared with placebo. There was no difference in overall treatment success, defined as at least almost clear skin or a large improvement (110322). It is unclear if any benefits are due to licorice, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAddison disease. Although there has been interest in using oral licorice for Addison disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nAdrenal insufficiency. Although there has been interest in using oral licorice for adrenal insufficiency, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if using a licorice-containing nasal irrigation suspension improves symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis.\nA clinical study in patients with allergic rhinitis shows that using a nasal irrigation suspension containing licorice extract 900 mg daily for 1 month improves symptoms such as nasal blockage, rhinorrhea, sneezing, postnasal discharge, and olfactory disturbance when compared with baseline (108569). Although the study also utilized mometasone 2 mg nasal spray and isotonic saline nasal irrigation as comparators, symptom improvement was observed in all three groups, and there was no statistical comparison of outcomes between groups.\nless\nAntipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. Oral licorice has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia shows that taking a combination of licorice and peony (Peony-Glycyrrhiza Decoction; PGD) 45 grams daily for 4 weeks reduces prolactin levels to a similar extent as bromocriptine (59775). However, another study shows that taking the same product at the same dose for 16 weeks has no effect on prolactin levels in females with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia when compared with placebo. Although the prolactin-related adverse event questionnaire total score was moderately improved, there was no effect on clinically meaningful symptoms or menstrual resumption (97219). Both studies show no effect on psychotic symptoms (59775, 97219).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in male patients with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia shows that taking an herbal extract containing licorice and peony (shakuyaku-kanzo-to) 2.5 grams three times daily reduces prolactin levels after 4 weeks, but does not have a significant effect on prolactin levels 4 weeks after treatment cessation (59907).\nless\nAsthma. Oral licorice has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study conducted in Iran in children and adolescents aged 6-18 years old with mild-to-moderate asthma shows that taking a combination of licorice, sweet violet, and jalap (Anti-Asthma, Sinafaravar) twice daily for a month in addition to standard therapy reduces cough severity but does not change shortness of breath frequency or severity, rescue inhaler use, respiratory indices, or perceptions of asthma severity when compared with placebo (113569). It is unclear whether this effect is due to licorice, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nBleeding. Topical licorice might reduce bleeding when used in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that topically applying 4 mL of a specific product (Ankaferd Blood Stopper, Mefar Ilaç Sanayi A.S.) containing licorice, Alpinia, thyme, stinging nettle, and common grape vine reduces bleeding, but does not improve the surgical time for episiotomy repair, when compared with saline (31010). Other preliminary clinical research shows that ampules of this same product placed in empty alveolus for up to 20 minutes reduces bleeding in postsurgical dental patients with increased bleeding tendency (31002).\nless\nCancer-related pain. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for pain in patients with cancer.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a 1:1 combination of licorice root and peony root, along with a Taiwanese tonic vegetable soup comprised of lily bulb, lotus seed, and jujube fruit, reduces pain levels in terminal cancer patients when compared with patients consuming only the soup or the regular hospital diet (59770).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral licorice for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nColic. Although there has been interest in using oral licorice for colic, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear whether oral licorice is beneficial for COVID-19.\nA small open-label study in adults in Iran with moderate COVID-19 shows that taking licorice (D-Reglis, Irandarouk Pharmaceutical Company) 760 mg three times daily for 7 days in addition to standard treatment with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily for 7 days does not improve oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, clinical symptoms, length of hospital stay, or mortality, when compared with standard treatment alone (113633).\n\nAs part of a combination treatment, a small clinical study in patients hospitalized in Egypt with moderate COVID-19 shows that administering oral licorice extract 300 mg (standardized to contain glycyrrhizin 60 mg) once daily and Boswellia serrata extract 300 mg twice daily for 14 days, along with following an institution-based COVID-19 treatment protocol, may modestly improve mortality and time to recovery when compared with patients receiving the standard protocol alone. The standard treatment protocol included acetaminophen, azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc, and enoxaparin (108579). It is unclear if any effect is due to licorice, Boswellia serrata, or the combination.\nless\nDental caries. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for the prevention of dental caries.\nOne clinical study in adults shows that swishing 15 mL of a solution containing licorice extract 1% once nightly before bed for 5 days may reduce the acid production of cavity-causing bacteria, which may modestly reduce cavity risk, when compared with using a saline solution (108567). The validity of this study is limited by the short duration of treatment and follow-up.\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if licorice toothpaste or mouthwash is beneficial for reducing plaque.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using 0.25% or 0.50% glycyrrhizin-containing toothpaste twice daily does not reduce the amount of plaque, gingivitis, or bleeding in patients with proper dental hygienic measures when compared with the same toothpaste without glycyrrhizin (59812). Also, other preliminary clinical research shows that using glycyrrhizin-containing mouthwash for 3 days does not significantly reduce plaque levels (59855).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if adding oral licorice to standard treatment is beneficial for improving depression.\nA very small, nonblinded clinical study in hospitalized adults with major depressive disorder shows that adding licorice extract 1400 mg daily, standardized to glycyrrhizin 7% to 8%, to standard treatment for 2 weeks improves depression rating scores when compared with baseline, although these improvements were numerically similar to those seen with standard treatment alone. Patients in the treatment group also took oral magnesium citrate 300 mg daily to prevent magnesium depletion. The validity of this finding is limited due to the small size of the study, short duration of treatment, and unclear reporting (108575).\nless\nDiabetes. Although there has been interest in using oral licorice for diabetes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nDry mouth. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with licorice is beneficial for dry mouth in people on hemodialysis.\nPreliminary clinical research in hemodialysis patients with dry mouth shows that rinsing with a licorice mouthwash containing 8.34 grams of licorice concentrate per 500 mL of water with every meal for 10 days does not affect salivary flow rate, but reduces subjective feelings of dry mouth by about 28%, when compared with a water-based mouthwash and control group (97220).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for reducing pain.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a syrup providing licorice extract 750 mg twice daily for the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle reduces pain as effectively as ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours in patients with moderate or severe dysmenorrhea (104558).\nless\nDyspepsia. Oral licorice might improve symptoms of dyspepsia when used in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nVarious combination products manufactured by Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH have been evaluated for dyspepsia. Two specific combination products containing licorice root (Iberogast; STW-5-S) seem to improve symptoms of dyspepsia. The combinations include licorice plus milk thistle, peppermint leaf, German chamomile, caraway, celandine, angelica, and lemon balm either with (Iberogast) or without clown's mustard plant (STW-5-S) 1 mL three times daily for 4 weeks (19532). A meta-analysis of studies using the Iberogast product shows that taking 1 mL orally three times daily over a period of 4 weeks reduces severity of acid reflux, epigastric pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting when compared with placebo (13089). Also, using a preparation containing clown's mustard plant, German chamomile, peppermint, caraway, licorice, and lemon balm (STW 5-II) 1 mL three times daily for up to 12 weeks improves dyspepsia symptoms in 40% more patients when compared with placebo (12724).\nless\nFamilial Mediterranean fever. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for familial Mediterranean fever.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of licorice, andrographis, Siberian ginseng, and schisandra (ImmunoGuard, Inspired Nutritionals) four tablets three times daily for one month reduces the duration, frequency, and severity of attacks of familial Mediterranean fever in children when compared with placebo (12382). It is unclear if these effects are due to licorice, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for Helicobacter pylori eradication.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that adding licorice (D-Reglis, Iran Darouk Pharmaceutical Co.) 380 mg twice daily to conventional clarithromycin-based triple therapy for 14 days improves eradication rate by an additional 21% when compared with conventional treatment alone. However, any additional benefit might be limited to patients with peptic ulcer disease (97221). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of licorice extract 100 mg and Lactobacillus paracasei HP7 in 150 mL of fermented milk daily for 8 weeks does not increase eradication rates when compared with fermented milk alone, although it may improve gastrointestinal symptom scores, decrease the gastric load of Helicobacter pylori, and improve some measures of inflammation when compared to baseline (100984).\nless\nHepatitis. Evidence for the use of intravenous licorice in the management of hepatitis B and C is mixed.\nIn some preliminary clinical research, a specific glycyrrhizin-containing intravenous preparation (Stronger Neominophagen C, Minophagen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) appears to reduce mortality due to viral hepatitis by about 50% (3250). Other clinical research suggests that this same product reduces serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in hepatitis C patients but does not improve hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA levels (3247, 59712, 59721, 59920). When used long-term, this preparation seems to reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis C patients when compared to long-term use of other supplements, such as vitamin K (59905). This product has been used in various doses: 40 or 100 mL, containing 2 mg glycyrrhizin, 1 mg cysteine, and 20 mg of glycine per mL of solution, administered daily for 4-8 weeks, followed by 40 or 100 mL 2-7 times weekly for 2-16 weeks, has been used (3250, 59905, 59915); 40-120 mL diluted in 100 mL of 5% glucose solution and administered three times weekly for 4 weeks (59712, 59721); 100 mL, which contained 200 mg glycyrrhizin, administered undiluted six times weekly for 4 weeks (59721); or 60 mL administered three times weekly for 16 weeks (59920). Other research shows that this preparation reduces ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in patients with hepatitis B virus (59915). Oral licorice has not been evaluated for this purpose.\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for improving cholesterol.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking licorice root extract 0.1 grams daily for one month reduces plasma total cholesterol levels by 5%, plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 9%, and plasma triglyceride levels by 14% when compared with baseline in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia (59725). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHyperkalemia. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for reducing potassium levels.\nSome clinical research in adults with diabetes and hypoaldosteronism suggests that taking glycyrrhizin 150 mg daily decreases potassium levels when compared with calcium polystyrene sulfonate (59897). Also, one very small clinical study in patients with anuria shows that taking glycyrrhetinic acid 1 gram daily for 2 weeks seems to decrease plasma potassium, but does not improve blood pressure, when compared with placebo (59723).\nless\nIgA vasculitis. Oral licorice has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small retrospective study in patients aged 5-36 years with newly diagnosed IgA vasculitis shows that taking compound glycyrrhizin (Eisai Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd) three times daily along with loratadine, calcium, vitamin C, rutin, and other unspecified conventional treatments is associated with an improvement in cutaneous purpura symptoms and time to symptom regression when compared with placebo. After 1 month, the rate of complete resolution and time to regression in the treatment group was 82% and 5 days, respectively, compared with 65% and 8 days, respectively, in the placebo group. Compound glycyrrhizin contained glycyrrhizin, glycine, and methionine and was dosed by age, with a dose of 25 mg daily in those 12 years or younger and 50 mg daily in those over 12 years (108580).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral licorice has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that a formulation containing licorice root, slippery elm bark, lactulose, and oat bran daily for 2 weeks improves stool consistency and increases bowel movement frequency by 20% in individuals with constipation-predominant IBS when compared to baseline. Symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, straining, and global severity might also be reduced (35462). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if any benefits are due to licorice, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nLichen planus. It is unclear if intravenous licorice is beneficial for lichen planus.\nA very small clinical study shows that intravenous administration of 0.2% glycyrrhizin solution, 40 mL daily for 4 weeks, improves clinical symptoms of oral lichen planus in a greater percentage of patients with chronic hepatitis C when compared with dental cleaning (59903). There is no evidence suggesting that oral licorice is beneficial.\nless\nLiver cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral or intravenous licorice preparations for liver cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nMelasma. Topical licorice has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a topical cream (Clariderm Clear, Stiefel Laboratories Inc.) containing 7% licorice, emblica, and belides twice daily for 60 days is as effective as a cream containing 2% hydroquinone for lightening the skin in patients with melasma (59824). It is unclear if this effect is due to licorice, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for reducing hot flash frequency or severity.\nIn one preliminary clinical study, taking licorice root extract 330 mg orally three times daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces the frequency of hot flashes by about 1.3 per day and the severity of hot flashes by about 40% when compared with placebo (94659). However, another preliminary clinical study shows that taking a specific licorice root extract (D-Reglis, Iran Darouk Pharmaceutical Co.) 650 mg orally daily for 90 days does not reduce the number or severity of hot flashes when compared to baseline (25694).\nless\nMuscle cramps. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for muscle cramps due to cirrhosis or hemodialysis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific combination of licorice and peony (shakuyaku-kanzo-to) might reduce muscle cramps in patients with hepatic cirrhosis or in patients undergoing hemodialysis when compared to baseline (13550, 13551, 13552). This combination was taken as 6-7.5 grams daily in up to three divided doses for 2-4 weeks in two studies (13550, 13552). In a third study, the combination was taken as 2.5 grams during hemodialysis with self-administration at the onset of muscle cramping (13551).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for NAFLD.\nA small clinical trial in females with NAFLD shows that taking licorice extract (Shirin Darou Company, Shiraz, Iran) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves some measures of liver health and glycemic control when compared with placebo. Modest improvements occurred in levels of alanine aminotransferase, as well as in measures of insulin resistance and severity of liver steatosis based on ultrasonographic evaluation. There were no effects on body mass index (BMI), plasma lipids, fasting blood glucose, or other liver enzymes. All patients were also given weight loss and healthy lifestyle advice (110320). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking licorice root extract 2 grams daily for 2 months reduces liver function enzyme levels in patients with NAFLD when compared to pre-treatment (59841). It is unclear if this reduction is clinically significant.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for weight loss.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific licorice flavonoid oil (Glavonoid) 300 mg daily for 8 weeks has no effect on weight or body fat when compared with placebo in obese patients (17727).\nless\nOral mucositis. It is unclear if oral or topical licorice is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of chemotherapy- or radiation-induced oral mucositis.\nIn patients with head and neck cancer undergoing chemoradiation, preliminary clinical research shows that using oral and topical licorice powder twice daily in addition to conventional treatments for 6 weeks reduces the overall incidence of mucositis and also reduces the risk of developing severe oral mucositis to 15.5%, compared with 20% in those using topical honey and 43% in those using conventional treatments alone. Licorice treatment consisted of yastimadhu powder 5 grams mixed in honey for topical application in the mouth, as well as yastimadhu capsule 500 mg twice daily orally (104562).\n\nA small clinical trial in patients with head and neck cancer and oral mucositis currently undergoing radiation therapy shows that applying a mucoadhesive film containing licorice to the upper lip mucosal surface four times daily for 4 weeks, in conjunction with standard oral care, improves pain scores, mucositis grading, and ulcer size when compared with placebo film (108572). The validity of this finding is limited due to the short duration of treatment and exclusion of patients with severe mucositis.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Although there has been interest in using oral licorice for osteoarthritis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nOsteoporosis. Although there has been interest in using oral licorice for osteoporosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for improving Parkinson disease symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with Parkinson disease shows that taking licorice extract 136 mg (containing glycyrrhizin 12.14 mg, polyphenols 136 mcg, and flavonoids 2.6 mcg) in a 5 mL syrup twice daily for 6 months improves Parkinson symptoms, tremor, and overall daily activities when compared with placebo (102961).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Evidence for the use of oral licorice for peptic ulcers is mixed.\nThere is some evidence that taking 6-12 tablets each containing deglycyrrhizinated licorice 380 mg, bismuth subnitrate 100 mg, aluminum hydroxide gel 100 mg, magnesium carbonate 200 mg, sodium bicarbonate 100 mg, and powdered alder buckthorn bark 30 mg (Caved-S, Cedona) in up to three divided doses daily for 4-16 weeks might accelerate the healing of peptic ulcers (11312, 11313). Some clinical research also shows that this product is as effective as carbenoxolone sodium (Biogastrone) when taken at doses of two tablets three times daily after meals for 4 weeks (59871). In contrast, taking deglycyrrhizinated licorice (Ulcedal, Cedona, and others) 450-1000 mg three to five times daily for 4-8 weeks or glycyrrhizinic acid-reduced licorice 760 mg three times daily for 6 weeks does not seem to reduce the need for medication, pain, burning, or other discomfort in patients with peptic ulcers when compared with placebo (59864, 59865, 59873, 59874).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral licorice is beneficial for improving physical performance in older females.\nA small clinical trial in healthy females 59 years and older shows that taking licorice flavonoid oil 300 mg orally daily for 16 weeks in addition to strength training does not improve walking speed or other measures of functional mobility when compared with strength training alone (102960).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral licorice has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking licorice root extract 2250 mg daily along with Ceylon cinnamon, levant berry, St. John's Wort, peony, and tribulus for 3 months with lifestyle modification improves symptoms of PCOS, including a reduction in oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea by 33% and the number of days between menstrual cycles by 43 days when compared with lifestyle modification alone. Although conception rate increased 4-fold in the intervention group, live birth rate was similar between groups (97216). The effect of licorice alone for the treatment of PCOS is unknown.\nless\nProstate cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral licorice for prostate cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if topical licorice is beneficial for improving psoriasis symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using a topical cream containing licorice extract and milk proteins twice daily for 4 weeks does not reduce the duration of corticosteroid cream therapy in patients with palmar and/or plantar psoriasis, but may improve skin peeling, the area of skin affected, and some subjective symptoms, when compared with corticosteroid cream alone (59823).\nless\nSmoking cessation. Oral licorice has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults in India with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing licorice 200 mg, ashwagandha, cowhage, ginger, turmeric, and other herbal extracts (Smotect, Smotect India) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked daily and levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity when compared with placebo (112115). It is unclear if these effects are due to licorice, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although there has been interest in using oral licorice for SLE, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nTuberculosis. Although there has been interest in using oral licorice for tuberculosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of licorice for this condition.\nUrticaria. Oral licorice has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with chronic urticaria shows that taking compound glycyrrhizin, containing glycyrrhizin, N-acetyl cysteine, and glycine, as 50-75 mg three times daily along with desloratadine 5-8.8 mg daily for 4 weeks improves response rate, cure rate, and recurrence rate when compared with desloratadine alone (108571). Another meta-analysis of clinical research in pediatric and adult patients with chronic urticaria shows that taking compound glycyrrhizin 25-75 mg 2-3 times daily improves efficacy rate of symptom reduction, increases cure rate, and decreases recurrence rate when compared with second-generation antihistamine monotherapy (113634). However, most studies included in the meta-analyses were low quality, and all studies were conducted in China. Higher quality studies in other geographic locations are needed to confirm these findings.\nless\nVitiligo. It is unclear if the licorice constituent compound glycyrrhizin is beneficial for vitiligo.\nA meta-analysis of 14 clinical studies in patients aged 3-68 years old with vitiligo shows that taking licorice constituent compound glycyrrhizin 25-75 mg 3 times daily for 2-6 months with standard treatment improves effectiveness, cure rate, and immune-mediated inflammatory markers when compared with standard treatment alone (112232). Additionally, a meta-analysis of clinical studies conducted in China in adults with vitiligo suggests that taking oral or intramuscular compound glycyrrhizin for 10 weeks to 6 months in combination with conventional therapies, including phototherapy, immunosuppressants, or traditional Chinese medicine, increases the percentage of patients with more than 50% regimentation when compared with conventional treatments alone (113635).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate licorice for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nLicorice extract is typically used in doses of 100-990 mg in 1-3 divided doses for 2-24 weeks. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, licorice is usually used in combination with one or more ingredients. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nConsuming a diet high in sodium or salt can exacerbate adverse effects of licorice such as hypertension and sodium and water retention (15600).\n\nLicorice extract is sometimes standardized to glycyrrhizin content. Concentrations of glycyrrhizin have ranged from 1% to 12% (25694, 59841, 90892, 90893).\nTopical:\nLicorice extract has been used in various topical formulations, including as a cream, gel, patch, spray, lozenge, paste, mouthwash, toothpaste, and gargle. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nLicorice-containing toothpaste has been standardized to contain 0.25% or 0.50% glycyrrhizin (59812). A gel containing licorice extract standardized to 1% or 2% glycyrrhizin has also been used (59732).\nIntravenous/Intramuscular:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn general, licorice products are standardized to glycyrrhizin content. Licorice extract obtained from various species of licorice has been shown to contain about 1% to 7% glycyrrhizin (90892). However, the European Pharmacopoeia notes that licorice root should contain at least 4% glycyrrhizin, and many commercial products are standardized to contain at least 12% glycyrrhizin (90893). Some oral licorice extract used in clinical research has been standardized to contain 20% glycyrrhizin (59841). In one study, a licorice extract provided 24% monoammonium glycyrrhizinate (110320). Licorice-containing toothpaste has been standardized to contain 0.25% or 0.50% glycyrrhizin (59812). Intravenous solutions used in clinical research have been standardized to contain 0.2% glycyrrhizin (59903). A topical licorice extract standardized to 1% or 2% glycyrrhizin has been used in clinical research (59732).\n\nIn a clinical trial, a licorice syrup was standardized to total flavonoids 4.87 mg/mL and total phenols 7.05 mg/mL (104558).\n\nStudies have also evaluated a formulation referred to as compound glycyrrhizin, which may have various ingredients. One formulation evaluated in clinical research contains glycyrrhizin, glycine, and N-acetyl cysteine (108571), whereas another formulation contains glycyrrhizin, glycine, and methionine (108580).",

Additionally, in one case report, a patient with neurogenic orthostatic hypertension stabilized on fludrocortisone 0.1 mg twice daily developed pseudohyperaldosteronism after recent consumption of large amounts of black licorice (108568).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, licorice might decrease the levels and clinical effects of CYP1A2 substrates.\nIn vitro research shows that licorice induces CYP1A2 enzymes (111404).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, licorice might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2B6.\nIn vitro research shows that licorice extract and glabridin, a licorice constituent, inhibit CYP2B6 isoenzymes (10300, 94822). Licorice extract from the species G. uralensis seems to inhibit CYP2B6 isoenzymes to a greater degree than G. glabra extract in vitro (94822). Theoretically, these species of licorice might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2B6; however, these interactions have not yet been reported in humans.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, licorice might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\nIn vitro, licorice extracts from the species G. glabra and G. uralensis inhibit CYP2C19 isoenzymes in vitro (94822).

Theoretically, these species of licorice might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C8; however, this interaction has not yet been reported in humans.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, licorice might increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C9.\nThere is conflicting evidence about the effect of licorice on CYP2C9 enzyme activity. In vitro research shows that extracts from the licorice species G. glabra and G. uralensis moderately inhibit CYP2C9 isoenzymes (10300, 94822). However, evidence from an animal model shows that licorice extract from the species G. uralensis can induce hepatic CYP2C9 activity (14441). Until more is known, licorice should be used cautiously in people taking CYP2C9 substrates.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, licorice might increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.\nPharmacokinetic research shows that the licorice constituent glycyrrhizin, taken in a dosage of 150 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, modestly decreases the area under the concentration-time curve of midazolam by about 20%. Midazolam is a substrate of CYP3A4, suggesting that glycyrrhizin modestly induces CYP3A4 activity (59808). Animal research also shows that licorice extract from the species G. uralensis induces CYP3A4 activity (14441). However, licorice extract from G. glabra species appear to inhibit CYP3A4-induced metabolism of testosterone in vitro. It is thought that the G. glabra inhibits CYP3A4 due to its constituent glabridin, which is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor in vitro and not present in other licorice species (10300, 94822).

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nIn healthy female volunteers, the no-effect level of glycyrrhizin over 8 weeks was determined to be 2 mg/kg, with a proposed acceptable daily intake of 0.2 mg/kg based on a safety factor of 10 (59718). In a case report of a 15-year-old girl receiving treatment for tuberculosis meningitis, licorice flavoring was used along with sodium para-aminosalicylate. The girl developed hypokalemia and died, which was considered to be likely due to the licorice flavoring (59735).\n\nOrally, due to its glycyrrhizin content, licorice ingestion can cause a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, or pseudohyperaldosteronism, with sodium and water retention, increased urinary potassium loss, hypokalemia, and alkalosis. These metabolic abnormalities can lead to hypertension, edema, EKG changes, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, headache, lethargy, muscle weakness, dropped head syndrome (DHS), rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, paralysis, encephalopathy, respiratory impairment, hyperparathyroidism, and acute renal failure. Although these effects are most likely to occur when 20-30 grams of licorice products containing glycyrrhizin 400 mg or more is consumed daily for several weeks, people with hypertension, heart problems, or kidney problems may be more sensitive and even low or moderate consumption of licorice may cause hypertensive crisis or hypertension in normotensive individuals (10393, 10619, 15589, 15590, 15593, 15594, 15596, 15597, 15599)(15600, 16057, 16835, 25660, 25673, 25719, 26439, 31562, 59709, 59716)(59720, 59740, 59787, 59820, 59826, 59882, 59889, 59900, 91722, 97214, 100522)(104563).\nTreatment\nTreatment of pseudohyperaldosteronism, which involves supportive care and potassium supplementation (104563).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animal research, glycyrrhizin administered alone was absorbed better and resulted in higher plasma concentrations than when given in licorice extract, possibly due to interactions between the constituents (59708). In human research, consumption of a licorice flavonoid oil containing glabridin resulted in a maximum plasma concentration of glabridin after approximately 4 hours. Steady state levels were reached within 2 weeks with a single daily administration of 300 to 1200 mg/day (59759).\nDistribution\nThe licorice constituent glycyrrhetinic acid has a long half-life, a large volume of distribution, and extensive enterohepatic recirculation (781, 15595, 15596, 15597, 15600). In human research, intravenous glycyrrhizin resulted in approximately 54-67 mL/kg volume of distribution (59713).\nMetabolism\nGlycyrrhizin is metabolized to glycyrrhetinic acid (also called glycyrrhetic acid) in the intestine by intestinal flora (781, 10619, 15598, 59754). Glycyrrhizin is hydrolyzed in a reversible manner to the aglycone derivative, 18-beta-glycyrrhetic acid, which is then transformed to a new compound, 3-epi-18beta-glycyrrhetic acid (59754).\nExcretion\nIn human research, consumption of a licorice flavonoid oil containing glabridin resulted in a relatively slow elimination of glabridin in a single phase with a T1/2 of approximately 10 hours (59759). The terminal elimination of intravenous glycyrrhizin was 7.7 to 10 hours in humans (59713).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of licorice is the root. Although licorice contains saponins, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, flavones, and chalcones, the main active constituent is considered to be glycyrrhizin, otherwise known as glycyrrhizic acid or glycyrrhizinic acid (59755, 59773, 59806, 59854, 59891). Glycyrrhizin content of licorice preparations is typically around 2-3 mg/gram (0.2% to 0.3% w/w), but can vary from 0.026-98 mg/gram (15598, 15600). The constituent glabridin is also found in the G. glabra species (10300, 94822).\nAnti-cancer effects\nLicorice is used in combination with other herbs to treat prostate cancer. In human research, a combination product including licorice was used to reduce prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels (6286). Licorice may also be useful for other types of cancer. In an animal model, licorice extract inhibited colon cancer growth (59763). A mechanism of action is not clear. However, the metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid has been shown to reduce cellular adhesion and induce cell death in tumor cells in laboratory research (59804). Also, the licorice flavonoid glabridin has been shown to inhibit cellular migration, invasion, and angiogenesis in laboratory research (59813).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nLicorice has anti-inflammatory properties. The anti-inflammatory effects of licorice constituents are likely due to induction of transforming growth factor-beta and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, interleukin-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and cellular degranulation, or oxidative or lytic activity (59777, 112232). Other possible mechanisms of action shown in laboratory research include the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, as well as nitric oxide production, all involved in the inflammatory process (59717, 59764, 59778, 59782, 59918, 104558). The inhibition of hydrocortisone metabolism by 11 beta-HSD, as shown in laboratory research, has also been suggested as a potential mechanism of anti-inflammatory action (59798). In vitro research suggests licorice extract may attenuate allergic reactions in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting calcium ionophore-stimulated histamine release from mast cells (108569).\nAnti-ulcer effects\nLicorice appears to block metabolism of prostaglandins E and F2 alpha, which suggests a possible beneficial effect on peptic ulcer. Preliminary information suggests deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) may accelerate the healing of peptic ulcers. DGL seems to be similar to carbenoxolone for ulcer reduction without the fluid retention or electrolyte imbalance of carbenoxolone. Carbenoxolone is a semisynthetic derivative of glycyrrhetic acid that is used outside the US for treating gastric and duodenal ulcer disease (11311, 11312, 11313).\nAntimicrobial effects\nLicorice is traditionally used as an antimicrobial, with in vitro research showing it has antifungal activity, as well as activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (104558). Licorice contains constituents such as glabridin, glabrol, and 3-hydroxyglabrol that possess antimicrobial activity in vitro (59887). In children at high risk of dental caries, a licorice extract lollipop reduced the number of Streptococcus mutans (59821). Clinical research in adults shows that swishing a tablespoon of a mouthwash containing licorice extract 1% once nightly before bed for 5 days might modestly reduce the number of Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus when compared with using a saline solution (108567).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of licorice constituents may play a role in its clinical effects, including its anti-inflammatory effects. Various chalcone and flavonoid constituents from licorice have been shown to have antioxidant effects (59755). Antioxidant effects of licorice have been shown in animal models (59750) as well as in human research, resulting in reduced oxidative stress and plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol oxidation (59725, 59784, 59794, 110320). According to laboratory research, increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity and macrophage PON2 activation are purported mechanisms of action underlying the antioxidant effect of licorice (59789).\nAntispasmodic effects\nLicorice has antispasmodic properties. In human research, a specific product containing licorice constituents (TJ-68) inhibited colonic spasms during colonoscopy (59744).\nAntiviral effects\nResearch shows that licorice might have activity against hepatitis B, hepatitis C, coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Glycyrrhizin- and glycyrrhizic acid-containing intravenous preparations (Stronger Neominophagen C and Remefa S) show activity against hepatitis B and C in humans, but the trials are too small to draw any definitive conclusions (3247, 3250). In vitro data suggests that glycyrrhizin suppresses the production and expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HbS-Ag) (3248, 3249).\n\nPreliminary evidence also suggests that glycyrrhizin may inhibit the growth of the coronavirus, which is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (10299). In adults with mild to moderate COVID-19, nebulized administration of the licorice constituents glycyrrhizinic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid (also called enoxolone) inhibited interleukin-17A expression, thereby reducing activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (113637).\n\nIn laboratory research, licorice or its constituents have also demonstrated antiviral activity against Epstein-Barr virus, HIV-1, respiratory syncytial virus, arboviruses, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex, influenza A, and others (59728, 59761, 59862, 59863). In human research, glycyrrhizin reduced the findings of HIV viral antigen, possibly due to inhibited HIV-1 replication (59856) and reduced hepatocellular damage due to chronic hepatitis B and C (59761). Purported mechanisms of action based on laboratory research include inhibition of membrane transport, fluidity, and fusion, and effects on viral latency and other cell functions (59761).\nCortisol effects\nGlycyrrhetinic acid, a metabolite of glycyrrhizin, inhibits renal 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, reducing conversion of cortisol to inactive cortisone in the kidneys (10619, 15593, 15594, 15595, 15600). Cortisol has equal affinity to aldosterone for mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal portion of the renal tubules, promoting sodium and water retention and potassium excretion (10619, 15593, 15594, 15600). Excessive licorice ingestion can therefore produce a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, with hypokalemia, increased urinary potassium loss, alkalosis, hypertension, suppressed plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations, and an increased ratio of cortisol to cortisone in the plasma and urine (781, 15591, 15592, 15595, 15596, 15597, 15598, 15600). There is considerable variation in the amount of licorice needed to cause these effects, due in part to variation in the glycyrrhizin content of licorice preparations. This is typically around 2-3 mg/gram (0.2% to 0.3% w/w), but can vary from 0.026-98 mg/gram (15598, 15600). There is also variation in people's response to licorice. Those with hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, or a high salt intake are more sensitive to its effects (15589, 15593, 15598, 15600). Finally, case reports of adverse reactions to licorice do not always make it clear whether licorice intake is in grams of pure licorice, or grams of licorice candy or another preparation. The metabolic abnormalities caused by licorice can lead to EKG changes, arrhythmias, muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, paralysis, and encephalopathy (10619, 15589, 15590, 15593, 15594, 15596, 15597, 15599, 15600). The increases in blood pressure and cortisol to cortisone ratio are proportional to the amount of glycyrrhizin ingested (7620). Glycyrrhetinic acid has a long half-life, a large volume of distribution, and extensive enterohepatic recirculation, and it may take 1 to 2 weeks before hypokalemia resolves (781, 15595, 15596, 15597, 15600). Normalization of the renin-aldosterone axis and blood pressure can take up to several months (781, 15595).\n\nSome research shows that Panax ginseng appears to compliment licorice by increasing serum cortisol concentrations (3257).\nDental effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that using glycyrrhizin-containing toothpaste or mouthwash does not reduce the amount of plaque, gingivitis, or bleeding (59812, 59855). However, in laboratory research, there is evidence of inhibited Enterococcus faecalis activity and retained viability of periodontal ligament cells (59815). Also, in human research, sucking a licorice extract lollipop reduced the number of Streptococcus mutans in children (59821).\nFat moderating effects\nWhile conflicting research exists (17727), using licorice orally or topically has been shown to reduce body fat in some preliminary studies (6196, 59741). However, licorice does not seem to decrease body weight or body mass index (BMI), likely due to the accompanying fluid retention commonly reported with licorice products (6196, 17727, 59741). The effect of licorice on body fat is thought to be due to the inhibition of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 by glycyrrhetinic acid (6196, 59741).\nGlucose moderating effects\nLicorice is commonly used for diabetes. However, in animal models licorice both increases or decreases blood glucose (59733, 59738).\nHepatic effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that taking licorice root extract reduces levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease compared to pre-treatment (59841). Although the mechanisms of action are not clear, hepatoprotective effects have also been seen in animal models of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury (59762).\nHormonal effects\nLicorice appears to have anti-estrogenic and estrogenic action. Preliminary research indicates that licorice does not stimulate the growth of estrogen dependent breast cancer cells (7860). However, the estrogenic effects of licorice might be concentration dependent. Glabridin, an isoflavone constituent of licorice, seems to have an estrogen receptor-dependent growth-promoting effect at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, it seems to have an estrogen receptor-independent antiproliferative effect (10617). Licorice also decreases testosterone production in men (3246, 13072) and women (59739). This is likely due to the licorice constituent, glycyrrhetinic acid, inhibiting the enzyme 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts androstenedione to testosterone. Glycyrrhetinic acid also seems to inhibit 17-20 lyase which converts 17-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione (13072). In human research, licorice with or without peony has been shown to reduce elevated prolactin levels (59775, 59907).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nIn human research, consumption of a licorice herbal tincture stimulated immune cells, as quantified by CD69 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells (32825). Clinical research in children and adults with autoimmune conditions (i.e. chronic urticaria, IgA vasculitis, and vitiligo) shows that taking compound glycyrrhizin (containing glycyrrhizin, glycine, and N-acetyl-cysteine or methionine) for 1 month may increase CD4 T cells and decrease CD8 T cells, CD4/CD8 T cell ratio, and IgE when compared with control (108571, 108580, 112232). In animal research, an herbal product containing licorice increased the number of leukocytes in the spleen and liver and increased splenic natural killer toxicity. However, there was no effect on the production of inflammatory cytokines or other agents (59710). Furthermore, in laboratory research, the aglycone derivative of glycyrrhizin, beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, inhibited human complement activity (59904).\nLipid effects\nPreliminary clinical research and laboratory research in animal models, suggests that licorice reduces levels of total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (59725, 59750). A mechanism of action is not clear.\nLiver enzyme effects\nLicorice affects cytochrome P450 enzymes. It appears to activate the nuclear pregnane X receptor in vitro. Activation of this receptor results in increased expression of drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and multidrug transporters (14441).\n\nHowever, some preliminary research suggests that the effect of licorice on cytochrome P450 enzyme activity may vary depending on the species. Licorice extracts from both G. glabra and G. uralensis seem to inhibit CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 isoenzymes in vitro (10300, 94822). However, licorice extracts from the species G. glabra seem to inhibit CYP3A4 enzymes in vitro (10300), while licorice from the species G. uralensis appears to induce CYP3A4 in animal models (14441). This may be because licorice extract from G. glabra contains glabridin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, while extract from G. uralensis does not (10300, 94822).\n\nEvidence about the effects of licorice on cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) isoenzymes is also conflicting. In vitro research shows that licorice extracts of G. glabra and G. uralensis inhibit CYP2C9 activity (10300, 94822). However, evidence from an animal model suggests that G. uralensis extract induces CYP2C9 activity (14441). Reasons for this discrepancy are not clear."

In one case report, a 32-year-old male used ligandrol 10 mg daily for 2 weeks. Soon after, he developed symptoms of elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, pruritus, fatigue, abdominal pain, and weight loss. These symptoms continued for approximately 2 months before diagnosis of severe drug-induced liver injury thought to be associated with ligandrol (112650). In another case, a 19-year-old male was hospitalized with jaundice with elevated liver enzymes associated with a mild mixed-type drug-induced liver injury following the use of an unknown amount of ligandrol daily for 7 weeks over an 11-week period. Liver enzymes returned to normal following treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid daily for 2 months (112682). It is unclear if these cases were due to unapproved substance(s) not reported on the label. In a third case, a 24-year-old male also developed jaundice, along with elevated liver enzymes, nausea, lethargy, and appetite and weight loss following the use of ligandrol for 9 weeks.

In a 52-year-old male, liver injury thought to be related to the use of testolone 20 mg daily (Alpha Bolic) for 4 weeks and then testolone 15 mg daily with ligandrol 10 mg daily (Alpha Elite) for 3 weeks occurred. The patient presented with elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, pruritus, diarrhea, and upper right quadrant pain; liver enzymes were significantly improved 3 months after cessation of the supplements and alcohol intake (108160). In another case of a 24-year-old male, a mixed-type drug-induced liver injury occurred after taking ligandrol and ostarine daily for 3 months, followed by taking 6 pills of a specific product (Spartan) containing anabolic steroids (112682). However, it is unclear if these cases of liver injury were due to ligandrol, the other ingredients, the combination, unapproved substance(s) not reported on the label, and/or alcohol use.\nless",

Specific strains are found as probiotics in supplements and functional foods. Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605, 101513). Probiotics are often marketed for various purposes, including allergies and gastrointestinal health.",
            "Warnings": "In April 2020, the genus Lactobacillus was reclassified into 25 different genera (101513). L. salivarius, which was previously classified under the Lactobacillus genus, was reclassified under the Ligilactobacillus genus. However, some product labels may still identify this species as Lactobacillus salivarius.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC): Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, there is no evidence that L. salivarius is beneficial for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Ligilactobacillus salivarius has been safely used in studies lasting up to 16 weeks (112543, 112544, 112548, 112550).

Ligilactobacillus salivarius has been safely used alone or in combination with other probiotics in studies lasting up to 16 weeks (111004, 112540). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of L. salivarius in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853).

Some lactobacilli species have been isolated in cases of bacteremia, sepsis, splenic abscess, endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, pancreatic necrosis, and meningoencephalitis. These cases are thought to be due to the translocation of bacteria from other locations in the body in which they occur naturally, such as the oral cavity, or the gastrointestinal or urogenital tract, and not to dietary or supplemental intake (107543, 110917, 110918, 110920, 110921). There are such examples of L. salivarius infection (112546, 112552). In one case, a male developed an intrabdominal abscess following gastric bypass surgery (112552).

Oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical trial in children aged 3 months and up shows that taking L. salivarius in combination with other probiotics does not reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea when compared with taking placebo, when the more stringent definition is considered excluding diarrhea of other etiologies. However, the risk of diarrhea of any etiology is reduced by 35%. The probiotic supplement provided a total of 10 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of L. salivarius W24, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis W51, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, L. acidophilus W55, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei W20, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum W62, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus W71, daily from the first day of antibiotic treatment until 7 days after treatment ended (110969). A small clinical trial in patients taking amoxycillin shows that taking a specific product (Ecologic AAD) for 14 days modestly reduces diarrhea-like bowel movements, defined as a frequency of at least 3 per day and/or a very soft or watery consistency, when compared with taking placebo. The product used in this study provides a total of 5 billion CFUs twice daily of L. salivarius NIZO 3675, Lactobacillus acidophilus NIZO 3678 and NIZO 3887, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei NIZO 3672, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NIZO 3684, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus NIZO 3689, Bifidobacterium bifidum NIZO 3804, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NIZO 3680, and Enterococcus faecium NIZO 3886 (95405).\nless\nAsthma. Oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical trial in children ages 3-14 years with asthma shows that taking a combination of L. salivarius LS01 (DSM 22775) and Bifidobacterium breve B632 (DSM 24706) one billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each twice daily for 8 weeks and then once daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces the number of asthma exacerbations. The odds of having one or two asthma exacerbations was more than three fold in children taking placebo when compared with children taking probiotics. There was no effect on the duration of exacerbation or use of corticosteroids (111004).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius is beneficial for atopic dermatitis.\nL. salivarius LS01 (DSM 2275) has been investigated for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in adults. A small clinical trial shows that taking L. salivarius LS01 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for 16 weeks modestly reduces symptom severity and improves skin-related quality of life when compared to baseline. However, it is unclear if L. salivarius is beneficial when compared with taking placebo (112541). Another small clinical trial shows that taking a preparation containing L. salivarius LS01 5 billion CFUs daily, along with Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 and tara gum, daily for 1 month modestly improves symptoms when compared with taking placebo (112544). It is unclear if this effect is due to L. salivarius, other ingredients, or the combination. L. salivarius has also been investigated in children with atopic dermatitis. In children up to 11 years of age, a small clinical trial shows that taking L. salivarius LS01 (DSM 22775) daily reduces symptom severity and itch intensity when compared with baseline. Benefits persisted for 4 weeks after treatment. Children took 2 billion CFUs daily for 8 weeks followed by 1 billion CFUs daily for an additional 8 weeks (112540). However, it is unclear if these changes are due to the product or natural changes of the condition.\n\nOther clinical research has investigated the effects of L. salivarius in combination with other probiotics for the prevention of atopic dermatitis. A combination of L. salivarius, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum, a total of 10 billion CFUs daily provided from 36 weeks' gestation and then to the infant until age 6 months, reduces the prevalence of atopic dermatitis at age two by approximately 60% (90234).

Vaginal Ligilactobacillus salivarius has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA preliminary clinical trial shows that vaginal application with a tablet providing at least one billion CFUs of a combination of L. salivarius, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and Levilactobacillus brevis (Florisia) might be beneficial for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Using this combination for 8 days reduces the proportion of patients with bacterial vaginosis by about 79% when compared to baseline. Taking this product does not seem to be more beneficial than using a pH lowering vaginal product (110951).\nless\nDental caries. It is unclear if oral heat-killed or viable Ligilactobacillus salivarius is beneficial for preventing dental caries.\nPreliminary clinical research in children ages 3-6 years shows that chewing tablets containing heat-killed L. salivarius (HM6 Paradens) (Acidolac Dentifix Kids, Polpharma, Poland) 10 mg twice daily for 2 weeks reduces the prevalence and incidence of dental caries over 12 months by an intermediate to large amount when compared with usual care with toothbrushing twice daily (112538).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius is beneficial for gestational diabetes.\nClinical research in patients with newly diagnosed gestational diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance at less than 34 weeks gestation shows that taking L. salivarius UCC118 1 billion colony-forming units daily until delivery does not affect levels of fasting glucose, the need for pharmacological therapy, or birthweight of the infant, when compared with taking placebo. There were also no clinically relevant benefits on plasma lipid levels. All patients were given dietary advice and regular follow-up care (96894).\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. It is unclear if oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius is beneficial for preventing exercise-induced respiratory infections.\nA small clinical trial in athletes shows that taking L. salivarius 20 billion colony-forming units daily for 16 weeks during spring endurance training does not reduce the proportion of patients developing upper respiratory tract symptoms for at least a week or the number of episodes, when compared with taking placebo (112542). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nHalitosis. It is unclear if oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius is beneficial for halitosis.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking a dissolving tablet containing L. salivarius WB21 (Wakamoto Pharmaceutical, Japan) 670 million colony-forming units (CFUs) and xylitol 3 times daily for 2 weeks reduces the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds, but does not reduce halitosis or tongue coating, when compared with taking placebo (112551). Also, another small clinical trial shows that chewing a dissolving gum containing L. salivarius G60 1 billion CFUs with inulin 1 gram every 12 hours after meals for 10 days, but not L. salivarius alone, modestly reduces halitosis and improves quality of life when compared with taking placebo. There was no effect on tongue coating (112548). However, these studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between the L. salivarius alone and placebo groups. In contrast, one small and preliminary clinical trial shows that taking a dissolving tablet containing L. salivarius WB21 (Wakamoto Pharmaceutical, Japan) 670 million CFUs and xylitol 3 times daily modestly reduces oral malodor when compared to baseline. L. salivarius was taken by patients with physiologic or pathological halitosis for 2 or 4 weeks, respectively (112549). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although there has been interest in using oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius for IBS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. salivarius for this condition.\nMastitis. It is unclear if oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius is beneficial for mastitis prevention or treatment.\nA small clinical study shows that taking L. salivarius PS2 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily from 27-32 weeks' gestation until childbirth reduces mastitis rate by 56% when compared with placebo in patients with a history of infectious mastitis. Milk bacterial counts and breast pain in patients that did develop mastitis were also modestly reduced (102291). L. salivarius has also been investigated in the treatment of infectious mastitis. Taking L. salivarius CECT5713 1 billion CFUs daily for 3 weeks results in breast pain recovery and mastitis recurrence in 85% and 7.1% of patients, respectively, compared with 29% and 30.7% of those taking an antibiotic. Milk bacterial counts were also reduced in patients taking L. salivarius (112524). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding. Also, the type of antibiotic used was dependent on the primary care provider.\nless\nOtitis media. It is unclear if oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius is beneficial for otitis media prevention.\nA small and preliminary clinical trial in children with recurrent otitis media shows that taking L. salivarius PS7 1 billion colony-forming units daily for 6 months reduces the number of acute otitis media episodes by 84% when compared to the 6-month period prior to supplementation (112545). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a direct comparator group and the use of historical data as comparison.\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius is beneficial for periodontitis.\nSmall clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate periodontitis show that taking L. salivarius does not affect plaque severity, pocket depth, or bleeding on probing when compared with taking placebo (112537, 112550). However, there seems to be a modest benefit in some parameters in smokers (112550). These studies have used a tablet providing L. salivarius WB21 (Wakamate Ds, Wakamoto Pharmaceutical Co., Japan) 670 million CFUs 3 times daily for 8 weeks (112550) or a suspension providing an unknown quantity of L. salivarius SGL03 (Salistat SGL03) daily for 30 days (112537). This product (Salistat SGL03) also provided unknown quantities of gluco-oligosaccharides, lactoferrin, essential oils of lemon and rosemary, and vitamin D.\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking probiotics during pregnancy reduces the severity and duration of nausea and vomiting by 16% to 54%. There was also a small benefit on stool hardness. A specific probiotic (Probiotics 10, Nature's Bounty) was taken as 2 capsules daily for two back-to-back cycles of six days with probiotics and two days without. Each capsule contained a total of 10 billion colony-forming units of L. salivarius Ls-33, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v and DSM 15312, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus Lb-87, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DSM 13434 and Lpc-37, Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-35, Lacticaseibacillus casei Lc-11, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04, along with inulin 200 mg (107199).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral Ligilactobacillus salivarius has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with moderate to severe symptoms taking mesalazine 1200 mg daily shows that taking an unknown dose of L. salivarius twice daily along with Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 and Lactobacillus acidophilus (Acronelle, Bromatech srl, Milan, Italy) for 2 years modestly improves patient- and physician-scales of overall symptoms when compared with taking mesalazine alone.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLigilactobacillus salivarius is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. It is found naturally in humans. L. salivarius is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605, 101513).\nAntibiotic adverse effect prevention\nIt is theorized that taking probiotics during antibiotic treatment can prevent or minimize normal flora depletion and pathogenic bacteria colonization. There is some evidence to support this theory (5500, 11382). When probiotics latch on to and colonize the intestinal and urogenital mucosa, it seems to prevent epithelial attachment by pathogenic bacteria. This prevention may be partially related to the production of lactic acid (4369, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092). Since probiotic strains may differ in specific metabolic activities, and not all species inhibit a wide range of pathogenic bacteria (6093), some researchers theorize that probiotic preparations containing several species might offer more benefit than a single species (6087, 6094). However, this theory has not yet been evaluated in studies.\nAntioxidant effects\nThe systemic antioxidant effects of lactobacilli such as Ligilactobacillus salivarius may play a role in its potential clinical effects. In animal research, heat-killed L. salivarius seems to reduce lipid peroxidation (110928).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSome researchers think probiotics might have immunomodulating effects (4368, 4369, 8512). Lactobacilli seem to modulate non-specific cellular and humoral immunity possibly by stimulating lymphocyte and macrophage activity (6089, 8565) and modulating cytokine production by mononuclear cells (4379, 8512, 105137). They also seem to decrease markers of hypersensitivity reactions and intestinal inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (4369, 11383). Some lactobacilli also seem to stimulate the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which protects against allergy (7743). In atopic dermatitis, lactobacilli might reduce serum levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL27 which attract T-cells to the skin (17117). They also appear to enhance synthesis of antibodies in response to microbial pathogens, particularly secretory immunoglobulin A (7754, 105137).\n\nL. salivarius LS01 is of interest for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in adults. Human research shows that taking this strain does not affect serum levels of Immunoglobulin E. However, the release of some cytokines involved in allergic and immune response from peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from humans taking L. salivarius is beneficially modified (112541).\nOral health effects\nLigilactobacillus salivarius is found in the oral flora and some strains are of interest for oral health. In humans, taking a dissolving tablet providing L. salivarius reduces levels of some pathogenic bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, and Tannerella forsythia in the saliva or plaque. The evidence is mixed as to whether taking L. salivarius affects the salivary pH (112539, 112543, 112549, 112551). In vitro, L. salivarius produces bacteriocins and inhibits the growth of the pathogenic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia (112548)."

D-limonene is the main constituent of the oil in citrus fruits and the essential oil of caraway. Lemon essential oil contains around 48% D-limonene (110422). L-limonene is found in many trees such as pine and in herbs in the Mentha family. Plants may produce limonene to prevent dehydration and inhibit the growth of microbes, especially fungi (12712, 12713).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research suggests that limonene may prevent the growth of lymphoma, breast, skin, liver, lung, colon, and gastric cancer cells. It might also cause regression of malignant tumors in animals. Limonene might help reduce the risk of cancer by inducing phase I and phase II cytochrome P450 (CYP450) hepatic enzymes that metabolize carcinogens to harmless products.

            "Overview": "Limosilactobacillus fermentum is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. It is found naturally in humans. Specific strains are found as probiotics in supplements and functional foods. Probiotics are live microbes that are viable in foods or as a food ingredient and that have confirmed health benefits (90605, 101513). Probiotics are often marketed for various purposes, including allergies and gastrointestinal health.",
            "Warnings": "In April 2020, the genus Lactobacillus was reclassified into 25 different genera (101513). L. fermentum, which was previously classified under the Lactobacillus genus, was reclassified under the Limosilactobacillus genus. However, some product labels may still identify this species as Lactobacillus fermentum.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC): Some oral probiotics, especially multi-strain products, seem to be beneficial for the prevention of NEC in low birth weight infants. While clinical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association, Canadian Paediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition conditionally recommend probiotics for the prevention of NEC, there is no evidence that L. fermentum is beneficial for this purpose. Also, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Limosilactobacillus fermentum has been safely used alone and in combination with other probiotics in studies lasting up to 12 weeks (112503, 112562, 112570). ... when used intravaginally and appropriately. L. fermentum has been used safely daily for up to 7 days and biweekly and/or monthly in studies lasting up to 10 weeks (6095, 111961).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in children of most ages. Limosilactobacillus fermentum has been safely used alone and in combination with other probiotics in studies lasting up to 6 months (98440, 105150, 112569, 112573, 112574). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of L. fermentum in preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 grams. Cases of bacteremia have occurred rarely in preterm infants given other probiotics (102416, 111610, 111612, 111613, 111850, 111852, 111853). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about cases of serious infections caused by probiotics reported in very preterm or very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams (111610). Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to these infants due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy (111608).\nPREGNANCY: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of Limosilactobacillus fermentum during pregnancy. However, there are currently no reasons to expect safety concerns when used appropriately.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Limosilactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 has been used with apparent safety when breastfeeding for up to 16 weeks (112566).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, Limosilactobacillus fermentum seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Mild gastrointestinal adverse effects.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There is concern that Limosilactobacillus fermentum may cause infections in some people.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, taking Limosilactobacillus fermentum may cause mild gastrointestinal side effects (112564).\nless\nGenitourinary\nVaginal burning was reported by one person using intravaginal Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus acidophilus in a clinical trial (111781).\nless\nImmunologic\nSince Limosilactobacillus fermentum preparations contain live and active microorganisms, there is some concern that they might cause pathogenic infection in some patients. Some lactobacilli species have been isolated in cases of bacteremia, sepsis, splenic abscess, endocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, pancreatic necrosis, and meningoencephalitis. These cases are thought to be due to the translocation of bacteria from other locations in the body in which they occur naturally, such as the oral cavity, or the gastrointestinal or urogenital tract, and not to dietary or supplemental intake (107543, 110917, 110918, 110920, 110921). There are specific examples of L. fermentum infections, including endocarditis, brain abscess, surgical site (esophagus) abscess, peritonitis, and abdominal sepsis leading to emphysematous gastritis (107543, 112565, 112571, 112576, 112577, 112578).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus fermentum is beneficial for asthma.\nA small clinical study in children aged 6 and up with asthma shows that taking L. fermentum GM-090 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), Lacticaseibacillus paracasei GMNL-133 2 billion CFUs, or both strains together daily for 3 months seems to modestly reduce asthma severity and increase Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) scores when compared with placebo (99785).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus fermentum is beneficial for atopic dermatitis.\nIn children aged 1-18 years with atopic dermatitis, clinical research shows that taking L. fermentum GM-090 2 billion colony-forming units (CFUs), alone or with L. paracasei GMNL-133 2 billion CFUs daily each, for 3 months modestly reduces symptom severity when compared with placebo (98440).\nless\nBacterial vaginosis. Oral Limosilactobacillus fermentum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA combination product containing L. fermentum has been tried in patients with both bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis, which typically occurs after unsuccessful treatment of bacterial vaginosis with antibiotics. A clinical study in these patients shows that taking a specific combination product (prOVag, IBSS BIOMED S.A.) containing a total of 100 million colony-forming units of L. fermentum 57A, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 57B, and Lactobacillus gasseri 57C daily for 10 days in conjunction with standard metronidazole treatment increases the duration of symptom-free remission to 71 days, compared with 47 days in those taking metronidazole alone (99784).\nless\nColic. Oral Limosilactobacillus fermentum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in infants with colic shows that adding a combination of L. fermentum CECT5716 and Bifidobacterium breve as 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) each daily, to human milk, formula, or water for 28 days reduces the time spent crying per week by approximately 160 minutes from baseline. Taking this combination is at least as effective as taking simethicone 20 mg four times daily (105150).\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus fermentum is beneficial for preventing respiratory infections in athletes.\nClinical research in male and female athletes shows that taking L. fermentum VRI-003 (PCC, Probiomics Ltd, Australia) 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 11 weeks does not reduce the number, duration, or severity of self-reported upper respiratory tract symptoms when compared with placebo (112564). A small clinical study in elite male athletes shows that taking 12 billion CFUs of this same strain for 4 weeks reduces the number of days of respiratory symptoms in general by 58% compared with placebo. There was no effect on symptom severity, the number of episodes, or the number reporting an episode (112567). Whether L. fermentum is beneficial for specifically preventing lower respiratory tract infections is unclear and might depend on sex of the participant. One clinical trial in males shows that taking L. fermentum VRI-003 1 billion CFUs daily for 11 weeks modestly reduces the severity, number, and duration of lower respiratory tract symptoms when compared with placebo. However, in females, although there is a modest reduction in symptom severity, the number and duration of these symptoms increased (112564). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be explained by differences in doses, treatment durations, number of individuals, and populations studied.\nless\nInfluenza. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus fermentum is beneficial for preventing influenza in vaccinated adults.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking L. fermentum CECT5716 10 billion colony-forming units daily for 2 weeks prior to and following influenza vaccination does not reduce the incidence of influenza-like illness over the following 4 months when compared with placebo. However, the number of episodes was modestly reduced in the 5th month following vaccination (112570). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nMastalgia. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus fermentum is beneficial for mastalgia.\nClinical research in patients with painful breastfeeding shows that taking L. fermentum CECT5716 daily for 3 weeks modestly decreases breast pain, and possibly Staphylococcus counts, when compared with placebo. L. fermentum was taken in doses of 3 billion CFUs, 6 billion CFUs, or 9 billion CFUs daily. These patients had painful breastfeeding and high mammary Staphylococcus counts, without acute mastitis (112568).\nless\nMastitis. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus fermentum is beneficial for mastitis treatment or prevention.\nMost research has been conducted in patients with mastitis. In patients with breast abscess related to lactational mastitis, clinical research shows that taking L. fermentum CECT5716 3 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 4 weeks following needle aspiration does not increase pain relief or reduce the recurrence rate of mastitis when compared with placebo. However, the rate of breastfeeding discontinuation due to mastitis recurrence was reduced by about 87% (112563). Taking L. fermentum CECT5716 1 billion CFUs daily for 3 weeks results in breast pain recovery and mastitis recurrence in 88% and 10.5% of patients, respectively, compared with 29% and 30.7% of those taking an antibiotic. Milk bacterial counts were also reduced in patients taking L. fermentum (112524). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding. Also, the type of antibiotic used was dependent on the primary care provider.\n\nResearch has also been conducted to determine the effect of L. fermentum on mastitis prevention. Clinical research shows that taking L. fermentum CECT5716 3 billion CFUs daily for 16 weeks starting within 6 days of childbirth reduces the clinical mastitis incidence rate by 51% when compared with placebo. The incidence of breast pain was also modestly reduced (112575).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus fermentum is beneficial for obesity.\nClinical research in adults with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 kg/m2 and 31.9 kg/m2 shows that taking L. fermentum MG4231 and MG4244 (MED-02) 5 billion colony-forming units daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces body weight, body fat mass, and body fat percentage, when compared with placebo. There was no difference in waist or hip circumference, BMI, or blood lipids (112562).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral Limosilactobacillus fermentum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical trial shows that 31.3% of patients with PCOS taking L. fermentum in combination with other probiotics daily for 6 months had regular menstrual cycles compared with 12.5% of those taking placebo. There were also modest improvements in testosterone levels and waist circumference, but not other hormones, insulin resistance, body weight, or most measures of quality of life. The product provided L. fermentum UBLF-31 1 billion colony-forming units along with Lactobacillus acidophilus UBLA-34, Bifidobacterium bifidum UBBB-55, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UBLP-40, Lacticaseibacillus casei UBLC-42, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus UBLR-58, Limosilactobacillus reuteri UBLRu-87, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) daily for 2 months and then twice daily for 4 months. All patients also underwent dietary and lifestyle changes (110974).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Vaginal Limosilactobacillus fermentum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial shows that 21% of patients with an acute UTI using vaginal suppositories containing L. fermentum B-54 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GR-1 had a recurring UTI compared with 47% of those using control suppositories. The probiotic suppositories, providing 1.6 billion colony-forming units of this combination, were used twice weekly for 2 weeks following a 3-day antibiotic course, then once a month for 2 months (6095).\nless\nVaginal candidiasis. Vaginal Limosilactobacillus fermentum has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn a small preliminary clinical trial in patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis who had undergone a week of oral fluconazole treatment followed by intravaginal L. fermentum LF10 and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 02, 72.4% of patients demonstrated a lack of clinical recurrence over a 7 month observational period. All patients took fluconazole 200 mg three times in the first week followed by intravaginal application with at least 0.4 billion colony-forming units of each probiotic, along with arabinogalactan and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on alternate days for 10 days and then once weekly for 10 weeks (111781). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Limosilactobacillus fermentum for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLimosilactobacillus fermentum is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. It is found naturally in humans. L. fermentum is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605, 101513).\nAntidiabetic effects\nProbiotics are of interest in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. In an animal diabetic model, Limosilactobacillus fermentum seems to reduce the increase in fasting blood glucose, prevent organ damage, and decrease levels of blood lipids and inflammatory cytokines (112572).\nAntioxidant effects\nHigh fat diets are thought to increase the risk of kidney damage and hypertension via a mechanism involving oxidative stress. Probiotic bacteria such as Limosilactobacillus fermentum are thought to have antioxidant effects. In an animal model of male offspring exposed to a high fat diet in utero, L. fermentum reduced blood pressure and prevented impairment of kidney function. The mechanism of action seems to be related to modulation of oxidative stress in the colon and kidney (112561).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSome researchers think probiotics might have immunomodulating effects (4368, 4369, 8512). Lactobacilli seem to modulate non-specific cellular and humoral immunity possibly by stimulating lymphocyte and macrophage activity (6089, 8565) and modulating cytokine production by mononuclear cells (4379, 8512, 105137). They also seem to decrease markers of hypersensitivity reactions and intestinal inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (4369, 11383). Some lactobacilli also seem to stimulate the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which protects against allergy (7743). In atopic dermatitis, lactobacilli might reduce serum levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL27 which attract T-cells to the skin (17117). They also appear to enhance synthesis of antibodies in response to microbial pathogens, particularly secretory immunoglobulin A (7754, 105137).\n\nLimosilactobacillus fermentum is of interest for preventing infections in clinical research. However, the evidence of benefit is limited and the relationship between L. fermentum supplementation and modifications in levels and types of immunoglobulins, cytokines, and/or immune cells is unclear (112564, 112567, 112570)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAbdominal pain. Oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri seems to reduce abdominal pain in children 4 years and older. It is unclear if any species are beneficial in adults.\nClinical research in children aged 4-18 years with abdominal pain shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 as 100 or 200 million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 8-12 weeks, but not 4 weeks, reduces abdominal pain severity and increases the number of days without pain when compared with placebo (17120, 96898, 105130, 113510, 112528, 112530). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that some benefit seems to be maintained 4 weeks after follow-up. However, the benefit on pain severity is smaller with study durations of 8-12 weeks. In addition, there was no change in the number of children with no symptoms at the end of the intervention period (105130). Although some individual research disagrees (96898), most research shows that there was no effect of L. reuteri DSM 17938 on pain frequency (105130, 112528). Most of the available clinical trials are small and well-designed studies in larger populations are still needed.\nless\nColic. Oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri seems to be beneficial for colic.\nClinical research shows that giving L. reuteri DSM 17938 (Probiotic Drops, BioGaia AB) for 21-28 days can reduce daily crying time and fecal excretion of Escherichia coli in breastfed infants. Symptoms appear to improve within one week of treatment (17118, 17530, 90240, 90294, 96278, 98432, 107505). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that L. reuteri reduces crying time in infants with colic (107505, 113504). One recent meta-analysis of clinical research investigating the effect of L. reuteri, usually as DSM 17938 or ATCC55730, shows that crying time is reduced by approximately 80 minutes daily when compared with control or placebo. There was also an increase in treatment efficacy, defined as a reduction in average daily crying time of at least 50%, when compared with control or placebo. However, the quality of research is poor and there was low confidence in the findings (107505). In some clinical studies, taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 reduced colic symptoms more effectively than simethicone 60 mg once or twice daily over a period of 28 days (17530, 96278). Some evidence suggests that this specific strain is also effective in reducing daily crying time in formula-fed infants when given for 28-90 days (90264, 96278). L. reuteri strain DSM 17938 (Probiotic Drops, BioGaia AB) 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily was used in these studies (17118, 17530, 90240, 90264, 90294, 96278). However, results from one large study suggest that this strain does not reduce crying duration in breastfed infants and worsens crying time and fussiness in formula-fed infants (90293). Reasons for this discrepancy are unclear. However, patients in the latter study were recruited from an emergency room and may have had more severe colic than patients treated in other studies. Another large clinical trial in formula-fed infants with colic shows that feeding a partially hydrolysed lactose-reduced formula containing an unspecified amount of L. reuteri DSM 17938 daily for 4 weeks might increase crying time when compared with a standard formula. However, it is unclear if this is related to L. reuteri or other changes in the formulation of the formula (112529).\n\nSome research has evaluated L. reuteri in combination with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus. Clinical research in infants aged 4-12 weeks with colic shows that taking this combination (FloraActive) 250 million CFUs with fructo-oligosaccharides 3.33 mg and vitamin D3 200 IU daily for 28 days reduces mean crying time by 2.7 hours by the end of the study, compared to a 1.9-hour reduction in the vitamin D group (99783).\n\nSome research has evaluated whether taking L. reuteri during pregnancy is beneficial for preventing colic. Clinical research shows that taking L. reuteri LR92 DSM 26866 (Prokid) 100 million CFUs daily during the last 4 weeks of pregnancy modestly reduces infant colic severity and frequency in the first 5 months when compared with taking placebo. Infants from mothers receiving placebo were 2.36-fold more likely to have symptoms of colic (112533).\nless\nConstipation. Oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri seems to be beneficial for functional constipation.\nThe best evidence of benefit in patients with functional constipation is with L. reuteri DSM 17938 (95339, 95341, 95343, 113503, 113507). Taking this product in doses of 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily in children and 100 million CFUs 2-4 times daily in adults for 4-8 weeks reduces abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, bloating, and incomplete defecation, and might increase the number of bowel movements per week, when compared with placebo (95339, 95341, 95343, 113507). In infants and children under 6 years of age, taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 100 million CFUs twice daily for 4 weeks is as effective as taking magnesium oxide 30 mg/kg daily for improving the frequency of defecation from baseline. However, there is no further beneficial effect when these products are taken together (113503). However, some clinical research shows that taking L. reuteri might not be beneficial in children also given other medications for constipation. One clinical trial in children ages 3-7 years given macrogol starting 10 grams daily shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 100 million CFUs daily for 8 weeks does not increase the number of bowel movements or reduce abdominal pain or pain during defecation when compared to macrogol alone (112531). A small clinical study in children shows that taking L reuteri DSM 17983 100 million CFUs daily in combination with lactulose 1-3 mL/kg daily for 12 weeks is no more effective than lactulose alone for improving pain, stool frequency, and consistency (112525). However, it is unclear if this study was powered adequately to detect differences between groups.\nless\nDiarrhea. Most research shows that oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri modestly reduces the duration of acute diarrhea in children under 5 years of age. It is unclear if oral L. reuteri is beneficial for diarrhea prevention in these children.\nMost clinical research shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 (BioGaia drops, BioGaia AB) up to 100 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for up to 7 days, along with oral or intravenous rehydration therapy, can modestly reduce the duration of diarrhea, primarily of non-rotaviral origin, usually in infants and children ages 3 months to 5 years (7751, 7753, 90246, 95336, 107636). In one study, the duration of watery diarrhea in hospitalized children was reduced by 1.2 days when compared with placebo and persistence of watery diarrhea after 3 days was reduced by about 40%. Although the diarrhea relapse rate was also reduced by 64%, the duration of hospital stay was not affected. About 60% of the children in this study had diarrhea of rotaviral origin (113508). However, some research disagrees. One clinical trial in children under 5 years shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 200 million CFUs daily for 5 days does not reduce the duration of diarrhea when compared with taking placebo, although the duration of hospitalization was modestly reduced. About 38% of the children in this study had diarrhea of rotaviral origin (112526). The European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388); however, both guidelines note that most evidence is low quality.\n\nL. reuteri has also been examined for diarrhea prevention. One clinical trial in healthy children ages 3-36 months shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 (BioGaia drops, BioGaia AB) 100 million CFUs daily for 3 months modesty reduces the frequency and duration of diarrhea by 35% and 1.1 days respectively, as well as day care absenteeism, when compared with taking placebo. Benefits persisted for an additional 3 months (113506). However, taking L. reuteri might not prevent hospital-acquired diarrhea. In children ages 1-48 months, taking 100 million or 1 billion CFUs of this strain during hospitalization for reasons other than diarrhea does not reduce the occurrence or duration of diarrhea or the length of hospital stay when compared with taking placebo (112523, 112534).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri seems to reduce the adverse effects associated with H. pylori symptoms and standard treatment regimens. It is unclear if oral L. reuteri improves the rate of H. pylori eradication.\nClinical research in adults shows that taking a mixture of two strains of L. reuteri (DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 6475; e.g., Gastrus, BioGaia AB) 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) of each strain once daily for about 14 weeks before and after triple therapy does not increase the eradication rate when compared with placebo. However, there was a reduction in the frequencies of some treatment side effects, including abdominal pain, epigastric pain, bloating, and diarrhea (90253). Other clinical research in adults also shows that taking a mixture of L. reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 6475 daily for 30 days starting with a 10-day regimen of quadruple therapy does not increase the eradication rate when compared with taking placebo. However, abdominal pain and distension were reduced in 47% to 121% more patients, respectively. The proportion of patients with other gastrointestinal symptoms did not differ between groups (113505). Other research suggests that taking L. reuteri improves the rate of H. pylori eradication as well as adverse effects associated with standard treatment. Clinical research in adults undergoing levofloxacin-based therapy shows that taking L. reuteri (Reuflor Italchimici Pomezia) 100 million CFUs three times daily for 14 days during eradication therapy and 1 week thereafter results in an eradication rate of 80%, compared with 60% in those taking placebo. Nausea and diarrhea associated with the use of eradication therapy were also modestly reduced, but there was no effect on other adverse effects associated with treatment (107563). Other clinical research in adults shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17 938 and ATCC PTA 6475 (Gastrus, BioGaia, Sweden) 200 million CFUs each once daily for 10 days with proton pump inhibitor, metronidazole, and tetracycline triple therapy is as effective as taking twice daily bismuth quadruple therapy for H. pylori eradication and improving gastrointestinal symptoms (112522).\n\nL-reuteri has also been investigated in children. A small clinical trial in children undergoing sequential therapy shows that taking L. reuteri ATCC 55730 (SD2112) (Reuterin, Noos) 100 million CFUs daily does not increase the eradication rate when compared with placebo. However, overall gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal distension, eructation, and halitosis, were modestly reduced (107564).\n\nHeat-killed L. reuteri has also been investigated in adults with H. pylori. Clinical research shows that taking heat-killed L. reuteri DSM17648 (Vita Medical Science & Technology CO., LTD) 10 billion cells daily for 4 weeks, with the latter 2 weeks in combination with triple therapy comprised of esomeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin twice daily, does not improve H. pylori eradication rate. However, gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal distention and diarrhea, were modestly improved (107504). However, taking non-viable L. reuteri DSM17648 in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, and Bifdobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (Phyloshot) twice daily does not increase the eradication rate of 14-day quadruple therapy or reduce adverse effects when compared with taking placebo (111101).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri seems to be modestly beneficial for lowering cholesterol levels.\nMeta-analyses of two clinical trials show that taking L. reuteri can reduce total cholesterol by about 22 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 20 mg/dL in patients with or without hypercholesterolemia (95399). The included studies used a specific yogurt or specific capsules containing L. reuteri (strain NCIMB 30242; Cardioviva, Micropharma Limited) 2.9-50 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 6-9 weeks (90268, 90269). Taking L. reuteri does not appear to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels in most studies (90268, 90269, 95399).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAntibiotic-associated diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in adults and children.\nA small clinical trial in hospitalized adults shows that taking L. reuteri ATCC 55730 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for 4 weeks reduces the frequency of AAD to 8%, compared with 50% in those taking placebo. There was no difference between groups for other gastrointestinal adverse effects (95401). However, in children, taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 200 million CFUs twice daily during antibiotic treatment was no more effective than placebo for reducing the frequency of AAD or other gastrointestinal adverse effects (102293).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral L. reuteri is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of atopic dermatitis.\nSome research has evaluated L. reuteri for the TREATMENT of atopic dermatitis. A small clinical trial in children aged 1-13 years shows that taking a combination of lyophilized L. reuteri DSM 122460 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 19070-2, 10 billion CFUs of each strain twice daily for 6 weeks, improves subjective symptoms of atopic dermatitis in 56% of patients, compared with 15% of those taking placebo. However, there were no differences between groups for overall clinical scores or use of topical corticosteroids (12773). Clinical research in adults with atopic dermatitis shows that taking 1 billion CFUs each of L. reuteri PBS072, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PBS067, and L. rhamnosus LRH020 for 56 days modestly reduces the severity of symptoms and improves skin smoothness and moisturization for up to an additional 28 days when compared with placebo (107506).\n\nOther research has investigated the effects of L. reuteri for the PREVENTION of atopic dermatitis. Clinical research shows that taking L. reuteri ATCC 55730 as 100 million CFUs daily during the last month of gestation and then through the first year of life reduces the incidence of IgE-associated atopic dermatitis to 8% at 1-2 years of age, compared to 20% of those taking placebo. However, there was no effect on the overall incidence of atopic dermatitis (16741).\nless\nAtopic disease. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for the prevention of atopic disease in infants.\nClinical research shows that providing L. reuteri ATCC 55730 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily during the last month of gestation and then through the first year of life reduces the prevalence of IgE-associated eczema and skin prick positivity at age 2 years when compared with placebo (16741) but does not reduce the risk of atopic disease, including asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, eczema, and skin prick reactivity at 7 years of age (90203).\nless\nBacterial vaginosis. Oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nThe available clinical research has investigated the use of a specific strain, L. reuteri RC-14, in combination with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GR-1. Some research suggests that this combination does not modify vaginal or fecal microbiota or improve cure or recurrence rates in patients also treated with metronidazole vaginally, when compared with taking placebo (111996, 111998). Doses in these studies included at least 1 billion CFUs daily of L. reuteri plus L. rhamnosus for 30 days in otherwise healthy premenopausal adults (111996) or 2 billion CFUs of L. reuteri and L. rhamnosus twice daily for 6 months in patients with HIV (111998). However, other clinical research in patients with bacterial vaginosis suggests that taking this combination of probiotics might be beneficial for improving cure rates and improving the vaginal microbiota. In these studies, cure rates increased from 40%-50% with placebo to approximately 88% with the L. reuteri and L. rhamnosus combination. In addition to a single dose of tinidazole 2 grams or metronidazole treatment, 2 billion CFUs each of L. reuteri and L. rhamnosus were used daily for about 1 month in these studies (111997, 112508). The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear but may be related to the differences in patient populations, geographical locations, and/or dosing of the product.\n\nThe effect of L. reuteri RC-14 and L. rhamnosus GR-1 for the prevention of bacterial vaginosis has also been investigated. A clinical study shows that taking capsules containing L. reuteri RC-14 and L. rhamnosus GR-1 as 2.5 billion CFUs daily from 9-14 weeks' gestation until delivery does not affect the rate of bacterial vaginosis when compared with placebo (102292). In patients with HIV treated with metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 10 days, taking 2 billion CFUs of L. reuteri and L. rhamnosus twice daily for 6 months does not improve the recurrence rates when compared with taking placebo (111998).\nless\nCancer. Although there has been interest in using oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri for cancer prevention or treatment, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. reuteri for this condition.\nCanker sores. It is unclear if Limosilactobacillus reuteri lozenges are beneficial for canker sores.\nA small clinical trial shows that sucking on a lozenge containing L. reuteri DSM17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 (ProDentis, BioGaia AB) 500 million CFUs twice daily for 90 days does not improve pain or severity of canker sores when compared with placebo (105145).\nless\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for cystic fibrosis.\nClinical research in children and young adults with cystic fibrosis shows that taking L. reuteri 10 billion colony-forming units daily for 6 months reduces the percentage of patients experiencing pulmonary exacerbations from 37% to 3% and upper respiratory tract infections from 20% to 3% when compared with placebo (90245).\nless\nDental caries. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for dental caries prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking L. reuteri 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily, from 4 weeks prior to expected delivery and until birth, and then continuing the supplement in the infants until 12 months of age, appears to decrease the prevalence of caries in the primary (baby) teeth of the child by the age of 9 years (90292).\nless\nDental peri-implantitis. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for dental peri-implantitis.\nA small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate dental peri-implantitis shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 (ProDentis, BioGaia, Sweden) one hundred million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 24 weeks starting a week after scaling and a 3-day course with antibiotics does not improve most measures of dental health when compared with taking antibiotics alone (113509). Another small clinical trial in patients with peri-implantitis shows that taking the same dose of L. reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 (PerioBalance, Sunstar Suisse SA, Switzerland) daily as a lozenge for 30 days as adjuvant to non-surgical mechanical debridement modestly improves pocket depth and bleeding on probing at implant level for up to 2 months after treatment when compared with mechanical therapy alone. There was no difference between groups in general bleeding on probing or plaque severity (112532). A meta-analysis of these and one other small study shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 and LR ATCC PTA 5289 is modestly favored when compared with taking placebo in these patients when pocket depth, bleeding, and plaque are all taken into consideration, but not when analyzed separately (112527). However, the individual studies were small and it is unclear if they were adequately powered. Also, the clinical relevance of any benefit is unclear.\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for dental plaque prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking L. reuteri, from 4 weeks prior to expected delivery until birth, and then continuing the supplement in the infants until 12 months of age, does not reduce dental plaque in the primary (baby) teeth of the child by the age of 9 years (90292). The available evidence related to the use of L. reuteri for plaque in adults is mixed. In a systematic review, four of the available eight studies showed some benefit on plaque when compared with placebo. However, the meta-analysis included only two studies investigating the use of L. reuteri, in tablets or lozenges for 7-8 weeks, and found no benefit for plaque. Overall, there was moderate evidence suggesting a lack of effect of L. reuteri on dental plaque (105147).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for type 2 diabetes.\nA small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes using no antidiabetes medications shows that taking L. reuteri ADR-1 M207154 4 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 6 months modestly reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo. These benefits lasted for an additional 3 months after treatment cessation. However, there was no effect on blood pressure or levels of blood glucose, insulin, or lipids. Taking heat-killed L. reuteri ADR-3 M209263 20 billion cells daily for 6 months modestly reduces systolic blood pressure when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on HbA1c or other glycemic, lipid, or blood pressure indices (107565). Also, another small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes who are using insulin and other antidiabetes therapy shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 (BioGaia) 100 million or 10 billion CFUs daily for 12 weeks has no effect on HbA1c, insulin sensitivity, blood lipids, blood pressure, liver health, adiposity, or microbiota composition when compared with placebo (107566).\nless\nDiverticulitis. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for diverticulitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis shows that taking L. reuteri 4659 50 million colony-forming units twice daily for 10 days in addition to standard antibiotic therapy modestly reduces abdominal pain, inflammatory markers, and duration of hospitalization when compared with placebo and standard antibiotic therapy (102299).\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for gingivitis.\nIn a systematic review, four of the available eight studies on probiotics showed some benefit on gingivitis when compared with placebo. However, the meta-analysis included only two studies investigating the use of L. reuteri, in tablets or lozenges for 7-8 weeks, and found no benefit for gingivitis. Overall, there was moderate evidence suggesting a lack of effect of L. reuteri on gingivitis (105147). Also, a small clinical trial in patients with gingivitis in the third trimester of pregnancy shows that taking two lozenges daily providing L. reuteri ATCC PTA 5289 and DSM 17938 (BioGaia AB) until birth modestly reduces the severity of gingivitis and dental plaque within two days of birth when compared with placebo. Each lozenge provided at least 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) of each strain (107568).\nless\nGroup B streptococcal colonization. Oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of two clinical trials shows that taking L. reuteri RC-14 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GR-1, starting at 35-37 weeks' gestation and continuing until delivery, does not improve GBS clearance during pregnancy. However, a well-designed study included in this analysis shows that taking 4 billion CFUs daily more than doubles the number of patients testing negative for GBS at delivery (105165). In addition, a small clinical trial shows that taking this combination as 2.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) each daily for 12 weeks starting at 23-25 weeks' gestation does not prevent the rate of GBS vaginal/rectal colonization at 35-37 weeks' gestation (107567).\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. reuteri for this condition.\nHypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. reuteri for this condition.\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for IBS.\nA small clinical trial in adults with IBS shows that taking L. reuteri ATCC 55730 (BioGaia AB, Sweden) 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for 6 months does not reduce symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea, when compared with taking placebo. For the first 7 days, 100 million CFUs were taken 4 times daily. Patients had constipation-predominant, diarrhea-predominant, or mixed-type IBS (112535). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nLactose intolerance. It is unclear if oral L. reuteri is beneficial for lactose intolerance.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking L. reuteri (Reuterin, Nóos) 400 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for ten days before a lactose breath test increases the normalization rate and reduces gastrointestinal symptoms when compared to placebo. Of those taking L. reuteri, 35% achieved a normal lactose breath test, compared with 0% of those taking placebo. However, taking the medication tilactase 15 minutes before the lactose breath test was more effective, with 80% of patients achieving a normal test and a greater reduction in severity of gastrointestinal symptoms (107507).\nless\nLow birth weight. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for improving outcomes in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.\nAn observational follow-up of a clinical study in VLBW infants found that adding L. reuteri (Biogaia AB) 100 million CFUs to a daily feed until hospital discharge does not improve motor, sensory, or cognitive outcomes by up to 2 years of age when compared with a control group (99779).\nless\nLyme disease. Although there has been interest in using oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. reuteri for this condition.\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical crossover study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking L. reuteri 5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for 12 weeks does not impact weight, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, or lipid parameters when compared with placebo (102300). This study might have been confounded by the short (6-week) washout period between treatments.\n\nL. reuteri has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research in elderly patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a combination of L. reuteri PBS072-DSM 25,175, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PBS067-DSM 24,937, and Lactobacillus acidophilus PBS066-DSM 24,936 as 2 billion CFUs each, along with the prebiotics inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides, daily for 60 days results in a 23% reduction in the number of patients continuing to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, compared with a 10% reduction in those taking placebo. In the probiotic group, there were modest improvements in waist circumference and levels of fasting plasma insulin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and inflammatory mediators when compared with placebo. However, there were no significant differences in fasting blood glucose or blood pressure. All patients in this study were on a Mediterranean-like standard diet (107560). It is unclear whether any benefits are due to L. reuteri, one of the other ingredients, or their combination.\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial or safe for NEC prevention.\nMost meta-analyses of clinical research show that giving lactobacilli enterally reduces the risk of NEC and/or severe NEC in preterm, mainly very low birth weight (VLBW), infants. Some meta-analyses support the use of lactobacilli in combination with bifidobacteria, as opposed to lactobacilli alone for reducing the risk of NEC (95344, 95351, 103437, 103445, 104157, 105162, 105164). Although there is limited evidence on the effects of L. reuteri, specifically, on the incidence and severity of NEC, a large clinical trial of infants with a gestational age of 32 weeks or less and a birth weight of 1500 grams or less shows that providing L. reuteri DSM 17938 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily in formula or breastmilk, from the start of first feeding until discharge, does not reduce the frequency of NEC or death over a period of 7 days when compared with placebo. However, there was a modest reduction in the frequency of sepsis and the duration of hospital stay was reduced by approximately 8 days (90281). Guidance among regulatory agencies and clinical organizations varies with respect to the use of probiotics in very low birth weight infants under 1000 grams. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that preterm infants given probiotics are at risk of serious infections caused by the bacteria or fungi contained in probiotics due to cases reported in this group of infants (111610). Also, The American Academy of Pediatrics does not support the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants, particularly those with a birth weight below 1000 grams, due to conflicting data on safety and efficacy and potential for harm in this vulnerable population (111608). The Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that probiotic combinations may be of benefit in reducing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates over 1000 grams. However, L. reuteri is not specifically recommended (103003, 111609, 111611).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although there has been interest in using oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri for NAFLD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. reuteri for this condition.\nObesity. Although there has been interest in using oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri for obesity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. reuteri for this condition.\nOropharyngeal candidiasis. Although there has been interest in using oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri for oropharyngeal candidiasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. reuteri for this condition.\nOsteopenia. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for osteopenia.\nA small clinical trial in females aged 75-80 years with osteopenia shows that taking L. reuteri 6575 (BioGaia AB, Sweden) 10 billion colony-forming units daily for 12 months reduces bone mineral density loss in the tibia by at least 50% when compared with taking placebo. There were no differences between groups in bone density loss at the hip, femoral neck, or spine (112521).\nless\nPeri-implant mucositis. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for peri-implant mucositis.\nA small clinical trial in patients with dental peri-implant mucositis shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 (PerioBalance, Sunstar Suisse SA, Switzerland) one hundred million colony-forming units (CFUs) daily as a lozenge for 30 days as adjuvant to non-surgical mechanical debridement modestly improves bleeding on probing for up to 2 months after treatment when compared with mechanical therapy alone. There was no difference between groups in general bleeding on probing or pocket depth, or plaque severity (112532). A meta-analysis of this and 3 other small studies shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 and LR ATCC PTA 5289 is modestly favored when compared with taking placebo in these patients when pocket depth, bleeding, and plaque are all taken into consideration, but not when analyzed separately (112527). However, the individual studies were small and it is unclear if they were adequately powered. The clinical relevance of any benefit is unclear from these studies.\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for periodontitis.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials in patients with periodontitis shows that using L. reuteri as a tablet or lozenge as an adjunctive therapy to scaling and root planing modestly improves clinical outcome, including clinical attachment, probing pocket depth and bleeding, when compared with control (107622). However, studies included in this analysis were small. One small clinical study in the analysis shows that taking a specific lozenge (Prodentis, Biogaia) containing L. reuteri DSM17938 and ATCC PTA5289, 100 million colony-forming units (CFUs) each, twice daily for 28 days does not improve clinical attachment levels of the gum, probing pocket depths, bleeding, or dental plaque when compared with placebo (102298). Another small clinical trial shows that taking this same lozenge for 12 weeks does not affect pocket depth, clinical attachment, gingival recession, or bleeding when compared with taking placebo. However, there seems to be a small beneficial effect on pocket depth in deep pockets and fewer patients were at high risk for disease progression (112511). The individual studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical trial shows that 31.3% of patients with PCOS taking L. reuteri in combination with other probiotics daily for 6 months had regular menstrual cycles compared with 12.5% of those taking placebo. There were also modest improvements in testosterone levels and waist circumference, but not other hormones, insulin resistance, body weight, or most measures of quality of life. The product provided L. reuteri UBLRu-87 2 billion colony-forming units along with Bifidobacterium bifidum UBBB-55, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus UBLR-58, Lactobacillus acidophilus UBLA-34, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum UBLP-40, Lacticaseibacillus casei UBLC-42, Limosilactobacillus fermentum UBLF-31, and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) daily for 2 months and then twice daily for 4 months. All patients also underwent dietary and lifestyle changes (110974). It is unclear if any benefits are due to L. reuteri, the other probiotics, or their combination.\nless\nPrader-Willi syndrome (PWS). It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for PWS.\nPreliminary clinical research in young adults and children aged 6 months and older with PWS shows that taking L. reuteri LR-99 30 billion colony-forming units twice daily for 12 weeks has modest beneficial effects on social communication, social interaction, and fine motor function when compared with placebo. However, there were no effects on most other symptoms including cognition, speech, emotional response, communication, gross motor function, and other behaviors. Taking L. reuteri reduced body mass index (BMI) when compared with baseline; however, it is unclear whether this change was significant when compared with placebo (107513).\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there has been interest in using oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. reuteri for this condition.\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for preventing respiratory tract infections.\nOne clinical trial in healthy children ages 3-36 months shows that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 (BioGaia drops, BioGaia AB) 100 million CFUs daily for 3 months modesty reduces the frequency and duration of respiratory tract infections, as well as day care absenteeism, when compared with taking placebo. The total number of respiratory tract infection episodes was reduced by approximately 54%, and the mean duration by 1.3 days. Benefits persisted for an additional 3 months (113506).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with RA shows that taking a total of 2 billion colony-forming units daily of a combination of L. reuteri RC-14 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GR-1 for 14 weeks does not improve symptom severity when compared with placebo (107569).\nless\nRotaviral diarrhea. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for rotaviral diarrhea.\nThe current guidelines related to the treatment of viral diarrhea are conflicting. While the World Gastroenterology Organization has not made a recommendation (98471), the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases recommends probiotics in hospitalized children with diarrhea (98469) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends probiotics for the outpatient treatment of acute diarrhea (95388). However, these guidelines note that most evidence is low quality and is not specific to L. reuteri or rotavirus infection. Although some research disagrees (112526), some clinical studies show that taking L. reuteri DSM 17938 (BioGaia drops, BioGaia AB) up to 100 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) daily for up to 7 days can modestly reduce the duration of diarrhea in infants and children, a portion of which had confirmed rotavirus (7751, 7753, 95336, 113508). In one study, the duration of watery diarrhea in hospitalized children was reduced by 1.2 days when compared with placebo and persistence of watery diarrhea after 3 days was reduced by about 40%. Although the diarrhea relapse rate was also reduced by 64%, the duration of hospital stay was not affected. About 60% of the children in this study had diarrhea of rotaviral origin (113508). However, taking L. reuteri might not prevent hospital-acquired rotaviral diarrhea. In children ages 1-48 months, taking 100 million CFUs of this strain during hospitalization for reasons other than diarrhea does not reduce the occurrence of rotaviral infection when compared with taking placebo (112534).\nless\nShort bowel syndrome. Although there has been interest in using oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri for short bowel syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L. reuteri for this condition.\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if giving Limosilactobacillus reuteri by enema is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nA small clinical trial in children with mild to moderate active symptoms taking oral mesalazine shows that giving L. reuteri ATCC 55730 (Reuflor Italchimici SpA, Italy) 10 billion colony-forming units each evening by enema for 8 weeks modestly reduces overall disease activity when compared with a placebo enema. A clinical response, defined as a reduction in disease activity by 2 points, and clinical remission occurred in 100% and 31% of children, respectively, compared with 53% and 0% of children given the placebo (113511).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in postmenopausal adults shows that taking an oral combination of L. reuteri RC-14 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus standardized to at least 1 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) twice daily for 12 months demonstrates similar efficacy to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 480 mg once daily for reducing the number of symptomatic UTIs. Although this probiotic combination was not associated with the increase in antimicrobial resistance that occurred with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, the antibiotic delayed the median time to first recurrence by two-fold and reduced the number of confirmed microbiological infections when compared with the probiotics (90235).\nless\nClostridioides difficile infection. It is unclear if oral Limosilactobacillus reuteri is beneficial for C. difficile prevention.\nCurrent guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) state that there is insufficient information to recommend administration of probiotics for the primary prevention of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (107538). The benefits of L. reuteri specifically for this purpose are unclear.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate Limosilactobacillus reuteri for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLimosilactobacillus reuteri is a species of lactic acid-producing, gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacteria. L. reuteri is found in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as in various fermented foods. Specific strains of L. reuteri are found as probiotics in supplements and functional foods (90605, 101513).\n\nL. reuteri is used therapeutically as a probiotic. It is considered \"friendly\" bacteria and is taken for the purpose of re-colonizing areas of the body (90605). Most researchers agree that the effectiveness of L. reuteri and other probiotics for all indications depends on its ability to colonize an area of tissue. To do this, preparations must contain live and viable organisms. Products stored for long periods of time or stored improperly may contain few live and active organisms. For oral preparations, bacteria must also remain viable after passing through the gut (3589).\nAntibiotic adverse effect prevention\nIt is theorized that taking probiotics during antibiotic treatment can prevent or minimize normal flora depletion and pathogenic bacteria colonization. There is some evidence to support this theory (5500, 11382). When probiotic lactobacilli latch on to and colonize the intestinal and urogenital mucosa, it seems to prevent epithelial attachment by pathogenic bacteria (4369, 4378, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092). Lactobacilli seem to have this effect by increasing epithelial mucus production and competing with pathogens for mucosal binding sites, possibly through steric hindrance (4388, 6086, 6089, 6091, 6092, 7755). Lactobacilli also inhibit bacterial pathogens by producing lactic acid, and some lactobacilli also produce hydrogen peroxide (6089, 6090, 6096).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn some clinical research, Limosilactobacillus reuteri supplementation reduced levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). This benefit was found to be related to increased L. reuteri in the microflora (107565).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSome researchers think probiotics might have immunomodulating effects (4368, 4369, 8512). Lactobacilli seem to modulate non-specific cellular and humoral immunity possibly by stimulating lymphocyte and macrophage activity (6089, 8565) and modulating cytokine production by mononuclear cells (4379, 8512, 105137). They also seem to decrease markers of hypersensitivity reactions and intestinal inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (4369, 11383). Some lactobacilli also seem to stimulate the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which protects against allergy (7743). In atopic dermatitis, lactobacilli might reduce serum levels of chemokines CCL17 and CCL27 which attract T-cells to the skin (17117). They also appear to enhance synthesis of antibodies in response to microbial pathogens, particularly secretory immunoglobulin A (7754, 105137). Some preliminary research suggests that Limosilactobacillus reuteri might prevent infection with Cryptosporidium parvum in immunodeficient patients. L. reuteri is known to secrete reuterin, which has activity against Salmonella, Listeria, Clostridium, and Escherichia species and other pathogens (7749, 7755).\nNeurological effects\nLimosilactobacillus reuteri is of interest for Prader-Willi syndrome. Some laboratory research suggests that L. reuteri upregulates the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin. This hormone plays a role in social bonding (107513)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of lingonberry is the dried leaf or ripe berry. The predominant phenolic compounds in the berries are anthocyanidins, including cyanidin-3-galactoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-arabinoside (59944). Constituents found in both lingonberry leaves and berries include flavonols such as quercetin, quercetin glycosides, kaempferol, and kaempferol glycosides; catechins and their glycosides; proanthocyanidins A and B; caffeoyl conjugates; 4-hydroxyphenyl-beta-gentiobioside, and coumaroyl-hexose-hydroxyphenol (16421, 35451, 59932, 59944, 59946). The berries also contain trans-resveratrol, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid and its derivatives, p-coumaric acid, morin, manganese, vitamin C, and omega-hydroxy acids including 9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid, 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid, 9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoic acid, 9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxyoctadec-12-enoic acid, and 18-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid (59935, 59942, 59943, 59944, 59947). The leaves also contain arbutin and fraxin (59941).\nAnthelmintic activity\nIn vitro research shows that extracts from dried lingonberries have vermifugal activity (59936).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThe constituents arbutin and fraxin extracted from lingonberry leaves have shown anti-inflammatory effects in rat models of acute and chronic respiratory tract infections (59941). In adult humans, concentrated fermented lingonberry juice used as a mouthwash reduced in periodontal inflammatory markers (104205).\nAnticancer activity\nIn vitro research shows that lingonberry extract inhibits the growth of colon cancer cells (35451). Other in vitro research shows that lingonberry extract induces apoptosis in human leukemia cells in a dose-independent manner (59940).\nAntigonadtropic effects\nResearch in male frogs shows that lingonberry leaf extract has antigonadotropic effects (59937).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research shows that the lingonberry constituent epicatechin-(4beta-->8)-epicatechin-(4beta-->8, 2beta->O-->7)-catechin has strong antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, but not Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Five other tannins isolated from lingonberry did not show antimicrobial activity (59933). In adult humans, concentrated fermented lingonberry juice used as a mouthwash decreased the growth of periodontitis-related microbes such as Streptococcus mutans and Candida (104205).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro studies show that lingonberry has antioxidant activity (59935, 59939, 59940, 59942). It seems that the total phenolic level in the berries is correlated with their antioxidant activity (59942). These phenolics appear to effectively inhibit both lipid and protein oxidation (59939). Anthocyanins, the main constituents in the berries, appear to be dose-dependent antioxidants (59935, 59939).\nAntitussive effects\nThe constituents arbutin and fraxin extracted from lingonberry leaves have shown antitussive effects in rat models of acute and chronic respiratory tract infections (59941).\nAntiviral effects\nAqueous extracts of lingonberries appear to induce resistance to tick-borne encephalitis virus, based on the degree of developing resistance to infection and virus accumulation in the spleen and thymus, in mice (59948).\nExpectorant effects\nThe constituents arbutin and fraxin extracted from lingonberry leaves have shown expectorant effects in rat models of acute and chronic respiratory tract infections (59941).\nUrinary effects\nSome clinical research shows that consumption of a cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate reduces the risk for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women and young girls (8253, 46452). The mechanism of lingonberry's effect in the urinary tract is unclear; however, it's thought that the hydroquinones released when lingonberry is ingested may act as a disinfectant in alkaline urine (18)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of lion's mane mushroom.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of lion's mane mushroom are the fruiting bodies and mycelium. Lion's mane mushroom contains polysaccharides, erinacines, cerebrosides, hericenones, erinapyrones, lectins, and phenolic acids. Lion's mane mushroom also contains proteins, sterols, fatty acids, and esters (91987).\nAnti-fatigue effects\nAnimal research shows that administering polysaccharides from lion's mane mushroom daily for 28 days increases exhaustive swimming times by 18% to 58% in mice. This anti-fatigue effect is attributed to the ability of these polysaccharides to decrease blood lactic acid, urea nitrogen, and malondialdehyde levels, increase glycogen content of tissue, and increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes (91997).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that lion's mane mushroom extract is cytotoxic against liver, colon, and gastric cancers (92616, 92628, 92633). In an animal model of colon cancer, lion's mane mushroom extract reduces tumor size by stimulating the immune system, inhibiting angiogenesis, and inducing apoptosis (92611, 92613). In vitro research shows that the antiangiogenic effect of lion's mane mushroom extract may relate to its ability to downregulate TNF-alpha-induced activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 (91987). Other in vitro research shows that extracts from lion's mane mushroom can promote apoptosis by activating caspase-3 and -9 (92610, 92633).\n\nOther preliminary research shows that lion's mane mushroom may help prevent cancer metastasis. In an animal model of colon cancer, lion's mane mushroom extract has been shown to reduce metastasis to the lung (92613). This effect was attributed to the ability of lion's mane mushroom to suppress the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading enzymes, such as MMP-2, MMP-9, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). Also, in vitro research shows that the lion's mane mushroom constituent cerebroside E may inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced tube formation, a process that plays a role in cancer cell metastasis (91995).\n\nSome preliminary research also shows that lion's mane mushroom may improve the effects of standard chemotherapy treatments or reduce their adverse effects. In vitro, the lion's mane mushroom constituent cerebroside E appears to lessen nephrotoxicity caused by cisplatin in an epithelial-like kidney cell line (91995). Other in vitro research shows that lion's mane mushroom extract can increase doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by increasing doxorubicin accumulation and doxorubicin-mediated apoptotic signaling (92615).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research shows that administering an aqueous extract of lion's mane mushroom daily for 28 days reduces serum glucose, increases serum insulin, increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in diabetic rats (91996). In vitro research suggests that the antidiabetic effect of lion's mane mushroom results from the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor activity of its erinacerin constituents (92626).\n\nIn addition to lowering serum glucose, some animal research suggests that administering lion's mane mushroom extract daily for 4 weeks attenuates increased sensitivity to pain due to alloxan-induced diabetes in rats. This effect suggests that lion's mane mushroom may reduce pain symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy. The effect was attributed to antioxidant activity of lion's mane mushroom (92632).\nAntioxidant effects\nLion's mane mushroom contains phenolic acids, constituents that are considered to be antioxidants. In vitro antioxidant assays show that lion's mane mushroom has modest to moderate antioxidant activity (91986, 91988). Other in vitro research shows that water-soluble oligosaccharides from lion's mane mushroom have antioxidant effects (91991).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro research shows that an ethanol extract of lion's mane mushroom inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation. This effect is attributed to hericenone B. However, this constituent does not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate, thrombin, adrenaline, a thromboxane A2 analogue, arachidonic acid, or the glycoprotein VI agonist convulxin. It is believed that hericenone B inhibits platelet aggregation by blocking collagen signaling from integrin alpha2/beta1 to release arachidonic acid (92619).\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research shows that administering lion's mane mushroom extract to rats along with a high-fat diet attenuates the increase in serum and hepatic triglyceride levels. This effect is attributed to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha agonist activity of lion's mane mushroom. Lion's mane mushroom does not appear to affect levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (91990). However, evidence from other animal research shows that a polysaccharide constituent of lion's mane mushroom can lower total cholesterol by about 33%, LDL cholesterol by about 45%, and triglycerides by about 34%, as well as increase HDL cholesterol by 31%. This hypolipidemic effect of lion's mane mushroom polysaccharide was attributed to modest hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition, and possibly reduction in cholesterol absorption (92631).\n\nOther preliminary evidence suggests that lion's mane mushroom may help prevent vascular disease associated with oxidative stress. In vitro research shows that lion's mane mushroom extract can inhibit LDL oxidation by about 68% and HMG Co-A reductase activity by about 60% (92603).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSome preliminary clinical research suggests that lion's mane mushroom can improve symptoms, improve dysplasia, and reduce inflammatory infiltration in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis (92630). In vitro research shows that a polysaccharide from lion's mane mushroom mycelium can interfere with the proliferation of precancerous gastric epithelial cells, a model for chronic atrophic gastritis, by inducing cell cycle arrest (92627).\n\nIn vitro research shows that lion's mane mushroom fruiting body extracts can inhibit Helicobacter pylori growth, with a minimal inhibitory concentration ranging from 12.5 to 400 mcg/mL. This anti-H. pylori effect was attributed to the lion's mane mushroom constituents 1-(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-butanone and 2,5-bis(methoxycarbonyl)terephthalic acid (92618).\n\nAnimal research suggests that an aqueous extract of lion's mane mushroom, administered one hour prior to ethanol exposure can reduce the area of ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats. This effect was attributed to the ability of lion's mane mushroom aqueous extract to protect gastric mucosa and inhibit the infiltration of gastric walls by leukocytes (92629).\n\nIn animal and human research, lion's mane mushroom seems to regulate the gut microbiota and the local metabolic environment (111933, 111934).\nHepatoprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that treatment with lion's mane mushroom extract 200 mg/kg by gavage prior to acute alcohol administration protects against alcohol-induced liver injury by reducing oxidative stress (91989). Other animal research shows that polysaccharides from lion's mane mushroom can reduce hepatic injury caused by carbon tetrachloride by decreasing oxidative damage (92608).\nImmunomodulating effects\nAnimal research shows that extracts from lion's mane mushroom can protect mice against Salmonella typhimurium-induced liver damage by activating innate immune cells (92612). In vitro research shows that polysaccharides from the fruiting body of lion's mane mushroom can activate macrophages to increase the production of nitric oxide and the expression of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (91993). In animal and human research, lion's mane mushroom or extracted polysaccharides seem to regulate the gut microbiota and metabolism (111933, 111934). In animal research, this change is associated with improvements in both the intestinal and systemic immune environments. In an animal model of cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression, lion's mane mushroom polysaccharides prevented liver damage and increased levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha (111933).\nNeuroprotective effects\nThe accumulation of the toxic amyloid beta protein in the central nervous system is believed to contribute to the initiation and progression of Alzheimer disease. In vitro research shows that pretreatment of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells with high molecular weight polysaccharides extracted from lion's mane mushroom can reduce amyloid beta-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting a neuroprotective effect (91988). In an animal model, Lion's mane mushroom improved recognition memory, but not spatial working memory (99109). Animal research also shows that administering lion's mane mushroom as part of the diet for 23 days can help prevent learning and memory deficits caused by amyloid beta in mice (92000). Other preliminary research shows that administering lion's mane mushroom mycelia or its extract reduces the burden of whole plaque by 39% to 56% and the number of whole plaques by 35% to 44% in an animal model of Alzheimer disease (92604). Benefits on amyloid beta plaque burden and degradation are related to erinacines A and S. Erinacine A can also inhibit the production of amyloid beta (99107).\n\nLion's mane mushroom may also have neuroprotective effects in cases of ischemic injury. Preliminary research shows that lion's mane mushroom mycelium prevents ischemic injury-induced neuronal cell death in an animal model. This effect was attributed to erinacine A. This constituent appears to attenuate the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced neuronal cell apoptosis that is associated with ischemic injury (91994).\n\nLion's mane mushroom is traditionally used for anxiety and depression. In an animal model, lion's mane mushroom had anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects, possibly related to increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus (99108).\nNeurotrophic effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that an ethanol extract of lion's mane mushroom can promote nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis in astrocyte cells or the hippocampus of rats (91998). Similarly, an aqueous extract of lion's mane mushroom and its constituent hericenone E and several others appear to stimulate NGF secretion and potentiate NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) and neuroblastoma-glioma cells (92602, 92614, 92634). Furthermore, some in vitro research shows that an aqueous extract of lion's mane mushroom can promote neurite outgrowth in dissociated brain, spinal cord, and retinal cells from chick embryos (92625). Theoretically, this neurotropic effect may benefit patients at risk for Alzheimer disease, as a deficiency in NGF is associated with progression of the disease (91998).\n\nOther preliminary research shows that administering an oral aqueous extract of lion's mane mushroom fruiting bodies speeds up the return of hind limb function and improves peripheral nerve regeneration in an animal model of nerve crush injury. Theoretically, this neurotropic effect may benefit patients with nerve injuries due to motor vehicle accidents, fractures, or dislocations (92605, 92606).\nRenoprotective effects\nAnimal research suggests that pretreatment with lion's mane mushroom may reduce kidney injury associated with ischemic reperfusion by decreasing reactive oxygen species and reducing oxidative damage (92609).\nWeight loss effects\nAnimal research shows that administering lion's mane mushroom extract along with a high-fat diet attenuates body weight increase by 30% to 42% in rats (91990).\nWound healing effects\nAnimal research shows that applying gel containing an aqueous extract from lion's mane mushroom fruiting bodies accelerates wound healing and reduces scar size (92607)."

            "Overview": "Lithium is a type of metal that is present in the diet, mainly in grains and vegetables. In supplements, lithium is typically provided in small doses in the form of various lithium salts. It is also found in some supplement products as a trace mineral. Lithium carbonate and lithium citrate are available as US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription medications for the treatment of bipolar disorder (9163); these and other lithium products used within commonly prescribed dosages are not within the scope of this topic.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when lithium carbonate or lithium citrate is used orally and appropriately. Lithium carbonate and lithium citrate are FDA-approved drugs and have been used safely in clinical studies (15, 97770). Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window and plasma levels must be monitored to avoid toxicity (15). Lithium levels should be drawn 12 hours after the last dose of lithium after steady state concentrations have been attained (approximately 3 days). Toxicity is most common at levels of 1.5 mEq/L, although some patients develop toxicity at levels less than 1 mEq/L (15, 97770).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of lithium aspartate, lithium orotate, or other forms of supplemental lithium.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when prescription lithium carbonate or lithium citrate is used orally and appropriately under medical supervision in children 7 years of age and older (15). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of lithium aspartate, lithium orotate, or other forms of supplemental lithium.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when lithium carbonate and lithium citrate are used orally (15). Lithium can cause fetal toxicity and increases the risk for cardiac and other abnormalities, including neural tube and urethral defects. However, it does not seem to increase the risk for preterm birth or low birth rate (15, 9166, 97770, 104266). Some research suggests lithium might increase the risk for spontaneous abortion. Based on a meta-analysis of 2 population studies, taking lithium during pregnancy may increase the risk for spontaneous abortion when compared with the general population, but not when compared with patients with affective disorders not taking lithium during pregnancy (104266). This suggests that it may be the presence of affective disorder itself, or the possible associated use of other teratogenic drugs or substances during pregnancy, which may increase the risk for spontaneous abortion.\nPREGNANCY: When the potential benefits to the mother and child outweigh the possible risk to the fetus, prescription lithium may be used with close monitoring by a healthcare professional (15, 9166, 97770, 104266). The safety of lithium supplements during pregnancy is unknown.\nLACTATION: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally. Lithium is secreted into breast milk and may cause adverse effects in the nursing infant (15). Prescription lithium may be used in circumstances when the potential maternal benefits outweigh the possible risk to the infant. The infant should be closely monitored for signs of lithium toxicity (97770).",

Plasma levels must be monitored to avoid toxicity. It is unclear how the lower doses of lithium found in supplements may alter the occurrence and likelihood of these adverse effects.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Edema, fatigue, fine tremor, gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, muscle weakness, polydipsia, polyuria, skin conditions, vertigo, and weight gain.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, lithium has been reported to cause bradyarrhythmia. A case of symptomatic bradycardia due to sinoatrial node dysfunction is reported in a patient with bipolar disorder who took lithium orotate 20 mg daily for 5 years, despite a serum lithium level in the therapeutic range (111327). Deep vein thrombosis is also reported in 2 patients with bipolar disorder who experienced toxic serum levels of lithium (111329). It is unclear if these effects are a concern with the smaller doses found in lithium supplements.\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, lithium can cause or exacerbate skin disorders such as hair loss, acne, psoriasis, and rash (9, 15, 97770). A case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome is also reported in a patient with bipolar disorder who took lithium carbonate at an unknown dose for 17 days (111317).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, chronic use of lithium has been reported to cause various endocrine disorders. Case reports associate chronic lithium use with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, goiter, hyperparathyroidism, and diabetes insipidus (9, 15, 104267, 104269, 104270, 104271, 111320). In one case report, a 68-year-old male with schizophrenia developed severe hypothyroidism resulting in myxedema coma after taking oral lithium carbonate. He recovered after discontinuation of lithium and administration of levothyroxine. At least two other cases of lithium-associated myxedema coma have been reported (97740). At least 4 cases of lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism have been reported in females aged 53-68 years that had taken lithium for 24 years or more. These patients presented with hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, elevated serum creatinine, thyroid or parathyroid abnormalities, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (104269, 105344). It is unclear if these effects are a concern with the smaller doses found in lithium supplements.\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, lithium can cause gastrointestinal symptoms. These adverse effects often improve with continued use (9). It is unclear if this effect would occur with the smaller doses found in lithium supplements.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, lithium can cause muscle weakness. This adverse effect often improves with continued use (9). It is unclear if this effect would occur with the smaller doses found in lithium supplements.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, lithium can cause vertigo, muscle weakness, lethargy, fatigue, and a dazed feeling. These adverse effects often improve with continued use. Fine tremor can occur and may persist with continued use. Chronic use of lithium can cause mild cognitive and memory impairment, particularly in the presence of dehydration or hyponatremia (9, 15, 97745). These long-term neurological adverse effects of lithium are potentially due to accumulation in the central nervous system even when blood levels appear within the therapeutic range (97745). Lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism-induced hypercalcemia has resulted in hallucinations, confusion, insomnia, and agitation (105344). A case of delirium and transient difficulty with word finding is reported in a patient with bipolar disorder treated with lithium 250-500 mg twice daily and 9 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy (111316). A case of mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) is also reported in a patient with bipolar disorder who had a toxic lithium level of 1.94 mEq/L (111318). It is unclear if these effects would occur with the smaller doses found in lithium supplements.\nless\nPsychiatric\nAbrupt discontinuation of lithium resulting in a rapid reduction in serum lithium levels can precipitate recurrence of bipolar symptoms (9165).

Chronic lithium use has been reported to cause central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and nephrotic syndrome (104269, 104271, 111314, 111319). Long-term lithium use is estimated to increase the odds of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by at least 2-fold and may contribute to CKD progression (111315, 111324).

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nElevated plasma levels of lithium can result in lithium toxicity (97770). Toxicity is most common at levels of 1.5 mEq/L or above, although some patients develop toxicity at levels less than 1 mEq/L (15, 97770, 111325). Toxicity is more likely to occur in the elderly and in people who have comorbidities or who are using multiple medications, even when blood levels are within the therapeutic range (97744, 97745). While lithium supplements contain smaller doses than prescription products, toxicity is reported with excessive ingestion (111325). Signs of lithium toxicity include diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, dysrhythmia, muscle weakness, lethargy, giddiness with ataxia, lack of coordination, choreoathetosis, tinnitus, blurred vision, tremor of the extremities and lower jaw, muscle hyperirritability, dysarthria, dysphagia, and drowsiness. Severe toxicity can cause toxic psychosis, syncope, kidney failure, dehydration, circulatory failure, coma, encephalopathy, and occasionally death (9, 97745, 97770, 111318, 111328).\n\nPreclinical studies suggest that lithium orotate might be more likely to cause nephrotoxicity than lithium carbonate (9164). Renal adverse effects are more likely in elderly individuals or individuals with existing renal impairment, comorbidities, or concomitant use of other nephrotoxic agents (97744, 97745).\nTreatment\nLithium toxicity is first treated by stopping the drug and resuming at a lower dose 24-48 hours later. However, if symptoms of toxicity are severe, treatment can include gastric lavage or hemodialysis, and correction of fluid and electrolyte levels. Urea, mannitol, aminophylline, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate have been used to increase lithium clearance (97770, 111322, 111323).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nLithium salts are virtually 100% absorbed from the small intestine via the sodium channels (9163).\nDistribution\nLithium is normally present in all organs and tissues, with highest concentrations in the brain and kidneys. Lithium is uniformly distributed in body water; there is only a small difference between extracellular and intracellular levels. It does not bind to plasma proteins (15, 9163, 97745). A rat model suggests that lithium orotate achieves higher serum and brain levels than lithium carbonate (111326).\nExcretion\nLithium is excreted unchanged, predominately in the urine. The elimination half-life is 20-24 hours with normal renal function, but increases with decreasing renal function. The half-life in elderly patients may increase to 36 hours. In renal impairment, the half-life can increase to 40-50 hours (15, 97770).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLithium is the lightest of the alkali metal elements. It is a monovalent cation and has some of the chemical properties of calcium and magnesium (15). Lithium appears to be an essential micronutrient; however, defined human lithium deficiency diseases have not been observed. Primary dietary sources include grains and vegetables with smaller amounts obtained from animal-derived foods. The average daily intake of an American adult ranges from 650-3100 mcg. In some geographical areas, drinking water may contribute significantly to lithium intake (9163).\n\nLithium is involved with many physiological functions. It works with other elements, drugs, enzymes, hormones, vitamins, and growth and transforming factors. Theoretically, many of the biological actions of lithium are attributed to the powerful polarizing effect caused by its small atomic radius, allowing it to displace sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium from membrane or enzyme binding sites (9163).\nCardiovascular effects\nObservational data in patients with bipolar disorder has found that taking lithium chronically is associated with a reduced risk of left ventricular remodeling and hypertrophy, which are risk factors for heart failure, when compared with patients who did not take lithium (111321).\nImmunologic effects\nLithium stimulates the production of colony-stimulating factor by monocytes. It produces neutrophilia and may also increase erythrocyte and platelet counts, and decrease lymphocyte counts. The increase in neutrophils is usually seen 3-7 days after initiation of lithium and rapidly reverses 1-2 weeks after lithium is discontinued (15).\nNeurological effects\nEpidemiological evidence suggests that areas with lower lithium content in tap water have higher rates of mental hospital admissions, suicides, homicides, and other crimes, suggesting that lithium intake might affect behavior (9163).\n\nThe exact mechanism of action of lithium in psychological and behavioral disorders is unknown. It appears to affect dopamine and serotonin activity (15). Lithium might increase monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity. It also enhances folate and vitamin B12 transport into brain cells, which might affect mood (9163).\nRenal effects\nLithium causes changes in renal function, often producing a mild nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The drug decreases renal concentrating ability and water reabsorption. Initially, sodium and potassium excretion increases. Some of these effects improve with physiologic compensation; others may persist (15, 104267).\nReproductive effects\nAnimal studies suggest that lithium deficiency can adversely affect mortality and reproduction. Lithium appears to be essential for fetal development, particularly during the first trimester of gestation. It appears to have a role in fetal blood cell development (9163)."

Research in animals shows that administration of lobeline, a constituent of lobelia, induces emesis in all treated animals (59983).\nGastrointestinal effects\nSome constituents of lobelia, including radicamines A and B, have been found to inhibit alpha-glucosidase in vitro (59973, 59976).\nNicotinic effects\nLobeline, a constituent of lobelia, has been traditionally used for smoking cessation. In laboratory research, lobeline acted as an agonist and antagonist at nicotinic receptors and inhibited the reuptake of dopamine (59977, 59974, 16414, 59991)."

Orally or intravenously (IV), L-ornithine-L-aspartate may improve symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis, but not in those with acute liver failure.\nMeta-analyses investigating the effect of oral or IV L-ornithine-L-aspartate in patients with overt or minimal symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy show that it improves symptoms by 21% to 30% when compared with placebo or no treatment. However, a high risk for bias and high heterogeneity limit the validity of these findings (94916, 97449). Another meta-analysis in patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy suggests that the odds of clinical efficacy are 3.7-fold greater with L-ornithine-L-aspartate when compared with observation alone (94909). The results of these meta-analyses agree with more recent randomized controlled trials. One clinical trial in adults with cirrhosis and a prior episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy shows that taking L-ornithine-L-aspartate 6 grams three times daily orally reduces the risk of developing overt hepatic encephalopathy at 6 months by 57% when compared with placebo. Another clinical trial in patients with cirrhosis and overt hepatic encephalopathy grades III or IV shows that adding a continuous infusion of L-ornithine-L-aspartate, 30 grams daily for 5 days, to lactulose and rifaximin is associated with a reduction in encephalopathy grade in 93% of patients, compared with 66% of patients receiving placebo plus lactulose and rifaximin. It is also associated with a lower 28-day mortality rate of 16%, compared to 42% in the placebo group (108931). However, evidence is conflicting in patients with minimal symptoms at baseline. One clinical trial shows that L-ornithine-L-aspartate reduces the number of patients with symptoms at 6 months (97450), while another does not (97906). A specific oral L-ornithine-L-aspartate product (Hepa-Merz, Merz Pharma) has been used in most clinical trials in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (67392, 67401, 67403, 67421, 94914).\n\nBased on meta-analyses of hepatic encephalopathy treatment and prevention, L-ornithine-L-aspartate seems to be as effective as lactulose (94916, 97449) and rifaximin (97449).

Ornithine and aspartic acid are metabolized in the body. Both are needed in the urea cycle for the synthesis of urea. In the hepatocytes and muscles, both may be metabolized to glutamine (67396, 94908).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nL-ornithine-L-aspartate is a stable salt of L-ornithine and L-aspartic acid. It is used as a source of the amino acids ornithine and aspartic acid (67394, 67396).\nFatigue reduction effects\nL-ornithine-L-aspartate is thought to reduce central fatigue during exercise. During prolonged exercise, ammonia levels build up in the blood, causing an increased uptake by the brain. L-ornithine-L-aspartate possibly reduces central fatigue by preventing an increase in systemic ammonia levels (94915).\nHepatic effects\nThe build-up of ammonia plays a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy neurological symptoms. L-ornithine-L-aspartate is thought to reduce levels of ammonia in the blood. It increases the metabolism of ammonia by promoting the urea cycle enzyme system, and the synthesis of glutamine. L-ornithine is an intermediate of the urea cycle and L-aspartic acid is a substrate for glutamine production in the muscle (94911, 94916, 108931). L-ornithine-L-aspartate has been shown to reduce both fasting and postprandial ammonia levels in numerous clinical trials (10655, 94910, 94911, 94916, 97450). While there is some remaining liver tissue to detoxify ammonia in cirrhosis, capacity for urea synthesis is decreased in patients with acute liver failure. This possibly explains why L-ornithine-L-aspartate produces a less dramatic reduction of ammonia in these patients (67396). In patients with cirrhosis undergoing the placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS), infusion with L-ornithine-L-aspartate 30 grams daily improved psychometric test scores and attenuated a post-procedure increase in fasting and postprandial ammonia levels. Lower ammonia levels may lower the risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy; however, this outcome was not evaluated (94910)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of lotus are the flower, seed, leaf, and rhizome node. Major constituents in the flower are flavonoids such as quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol (95261, 95266). Leaves contain these flavonoids, as well as terpenoids and benzyl isoquinoline or bisbenzoisoquinoline alkaloids such as nuciferine, norcoclaurine, roemerine, armepavine, and related compounds (95261, 95266, 112722). The seeds are high in neferine, liensinine, isoliensinine, nuciferine, dauricine, roemerine, armepavine and proanthocyanidins (95261, 95266, 99737).\nAnti-cancer effects\nVarious alkaloids in lotus seeds and leaves are of interest as anti-cancer agents. Extracts of various parts of the plant have shown the ability to induce the death of cancer cells in laboratory models. The most studied constituent of lotus seeds is neferine. Neferine reverses multi-drug resistance of gastric cancer cells. It also inhibits proliferation of cancer cells and causes cell death by apoptosis. Other constituents of interest in laboratory models include isoliensinine, liensinine, and 7-hydroxydehydronuciferine (95261, 95266). In laboratory models, extracts of lotus leaves have also been shown to prevent the spread of cancer cells by slowing down both migration and angiogenesis (95266).\nAnti-diarrheal effects\nThe flowers, seeds, and rhizome of lotus are all used traditionally for treating diarrhea. In an animal model, a rhizome extract was found to be effective as an antidiarrheal agent, reducing stool frequency and wetness (60054).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nVarious parts of the lotus plant are used orally or topically for inflammatory skin diseases or other inflammatory conditions. Some laboratory research shows that extracts of the lotus rhizome reduce edema, possibly by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins. Potential constituents of interest include nuciferine and hyperoside. The anti-inflammatory effects of lotus likely explain the benefits seen in animal models of fever and allergic response (42855, 60052, 95261, 95266). Another lotus constituent, neferine, might also have anti-inflammatory effects. Research in vitro shows that neferine reduces the release of inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) from cells exposed to a hypoxic environment (99736).\nAnti-obesity effects\nThe leaves, seeds, and flower petals of lotus have shown anti-obesity and weight loss effects in animal and laboratory models. Flavonoid constituents stimulate the breakdown of fat tissue, possibly by a mechanism involving the beta-adrenergic pathway. Extracts of leaves and petals inhibit enzymes involved in digestion and the use of fat and carbohydrates. Both alkaloid and flavonoid constituents likely play a role in these mechanisms (60013, 60019, 95261, 95266, 112720). Seed extracts inhibit adipogenesis and adipogenic factors like leptin (95266, 99737). In addition, animal research in rats shows that taking lotus leaf extract orally for 5 months reduces gut firmicutes when compared with control (112720).\n\nThere is also interest in using fermented lotus leaf for obesity. Research in rats fed a high fat diet shows that taking fermented lotus leaf for 5 weeks reduces body weight when compared with control (112721).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is interest in using lotus leaf, seed, and rhizome for diabetes. Animal research in diabetic models shows that taking lotus leaf, seed, or rhizome can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and lower blood glucose levels (60053, 95261, 95266, 112722, 112723). Some animal and laboratory research suggests that the constituents neferine, nuciferine, and/or norcoclaurine may be responsible for this activity (60031, 99737, 112722). Several mechanisms for the antidiabetic activity of lotus seed and related constituents have been demonstrated in vitro and in animal research, including direct insulinomimetic or other activity at the pancreatic islet cell, inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, inhibition of alpha-amylase, and direct inhibition of glucose absorption (60053, 95261, 96266, 112722, 112723).\n\nThere is also interest in using fermented lotus leaf for diabetes. Research in rats fed a high fat diet shows that taking fermented lotus leaf for 5 weeks improves fasting blood glucose levels and insulin resistance when compared with control (112721).\nAntimicrobial effects\nLotus flower and leaf extracts have shown anti-bacterial and antifungal effects in vitro. For example, growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus niger were affected by these extracts. Lotus constituents, likely the flavonoids, seem to inhibit gene-related mechanisms causing death and preventing antibiotic resistance (60020, 60023, 95266).\nAntipyretic effects\nThe lotus stalk and rhizome might be useful to reduce fever. In animal models, extracts of both parts of the plant had anti-pyretic effects. The extracts were as effective as acetaminophen (59993, 60050, 95261).\nAntiviral effects\nLotus seeds have antiviral effects. The seed extracts have shown antiviral activity against herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and rotavirus. Constituents of interest include flavonoids and alkaloids found in the leaves and seeds. These constituents have shown antiviral effects against HIV and HSV-1, possibly by a mechanism related to inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of gene expression (60009, 95261, 95266).\nCardioprotective effects\nTraditionally, lotus is used for its cardioprotective effects. From laboratory research, lotus seems to be beneficial in the prevention of atherosclerosis, platelet activity, and arrhythmia. In an animal model, both the leaf and root extract slowed down the progression of atherosclerosis. In an obese animal model, the leaf extract and seed extract lowered cholesterol levels. Lotus constituents seem to protect against the proliferation and movement of smooth muscle cells; reduce levels and oxidation of cholesterol; and inhibit the activity of platelets. Active constituents include neferine, isoliensinine, and liensinine (59994, 60005, 60016, 60034, 95261, 95266, 99737, 112720).\n\nThere is also interest in using fermented lotus leaf for cardioprotective effects. Research in rats fed a high fat diet shows that taking fermented lotus leaf for 5 weeks reduces serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared with control (112721).\n\nConstituents of lotus have also been shown to have anti-arrhythmic effects. The lotus constituents neferine and liensinine prevent ventricular arrhythmias in animal models, possibly by blocking the cellular influx of calcium and sodium, resulting in a reduced contractile force (59998, 95261, 95266).\nDermatological effects\nLotus parts are used both orally and topically for skin diseases and skin health. In animal models, a lotus leaf extract protected against wrinkles induced by ultraviolet light by reducing the activity of inflammatory cytokines. Consumption of lotus seeds increases skin moisture content, protecting elasticity. Antioxidant effects played a role. Furthermore, extracts of various parts of the plant, including the leaf, seed, and flower, inhibit activity of the enzyme elastase, which is involved in the degradation of proteins in the skin (95266).\nHepatoprotective effects\nLotus is traditionally used for liver health. In vitro, lotus seed and leaf extracts have shown hepatoprotective effects against liver toxins, including the prevention of cell death and release of liver enzymes. A leaf extract protected against liver toxicity in vitro by altering the activity of antioxidant enzymes (59996, 60030, 95261, 95266). Lotus also protects the liver against fat build-up. In an animal model, a leaf and root extract protected against lipid accumulation, possibly by promoting lipid transport from the liver, increasing use of the fat, and decreasing inflammation in the liver (95261, 95266).\nHormonal effects\nThe lotus rhizome is traditionally used for involuntary ejaculation. Animal research shows that the constituent neferine controls activity in the corpus cavernosum (95261). Hormonal effects have also been shown in both male and female animal models, resulting in maturation delay and reduced sperm production and function. Some lotus constituents seem to suppress the production of hormones, including gonadotropin releasing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone, as well as the activity of estrogen (95261).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nSome constituents of lotus are of interest for immunomodulatory effects in laboratory models. Various parts of the lotus are used for infectious diarrhea, as well as cough and sore throat. Although immunological effects of lotus have not been shown in humans, laboratory research suggests that lotus extract suppresses the proliferation of T cells, possibly in a manner related to the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines (95261). Also, in an animal model of systemic lupus erythematosus, the lotus constituent armepavine extended lifespan (95261).\nNeurological effects\nThe lotus stem is traditionally used for anxiety. However, any neurological benefits of lotus are unclear in humans. The leaf extract has hypnotic, anxiolytic, and anti-depressant effects in laboratory research, possibly via effects on the GABA receptor (95266). Animal and laboratory research also suggests that alkaloids and flavonoids from lotus inhibit enzymes involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, such as acetylcholinesterase, and promote the proliferation of neuroblasts. The antioxidant effects of some of the constituents might also play a role in any neuroprotective mechanisms (95266, 112722).\nSleep effects\nAnimal research shows that giving 100-150 mg/kg orally of a water extract of lotus rhizome reduces sleep latency, prolongs sleep duration, and increases non-REM sleep when compared with control. Non-REM sleep duration also increases in animals with caffeine-induced insomnia. The mechanism is thought to involve gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors since their expression and concentration in the brain are increased by the extract. Sleep-promoting properties of alkaloids from lotus leaves and seeds have also been demonstrated (110685)."

Pedicularis artselaeri contains 6- O-methyl-epiaucubin, artselaenins A, B, and C, artselaeroside A and B, as well as nine iridoid glycosides and five phenylpropanoid glycosides (26940). Pedicularis spicata contains pedicularioside A and H, gardoside methyl ester, shanzhiside methyl ester, 5-deoxypulchelloside I, and verbascoside (26941). Pedicularis striata contains pedicularioside A, acteoside, isoacteoside, decaffeoylacteoside, echinacoside, and 8-acetylharpagide (26942). Pedicularis longiflora contains longiflorosides A, B, C, and D, and dehydro-diconiferyl alcohol-4- O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (26943). The ethanolic extract of Pedicularis muscicola contains syringaresinol-4\"-O-beta-D-glucoside, sesamoside, phloyoside II, and caryoptoside (26944). Pedicularis lasiophrys pediculariosides E and F, verbascoside, cistanosides C and D, and 8-epiloganin (26945).\nAnticancer effects\nLousewort contains constituents that might have antiproliferative effects. Evidence from in vitro research shows that isoverbascoside, a phenylpropanoid glycoside constituent of lousewort, dose-dependently inhibits the proliferation of human gastric cancer and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (26946, 26947). Other in vitro research suggests that verbascoside promotes cell differentiation and reduces cell proliferation in gastric cancer cells (26948, 26949).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that several constituents isolated from lousewort have antioxidant activity, including leucosceptoside A and martynoside isolated from Pedicularis alashanica Maxim; verbascoside, pediculariosides A, M, and N isolated from Pedicularis striata; and isoacteoside, acteoside, echinacoside, pedicularioside A, and cistanoside D isolated from various Pedicularis species (26950, 26951, 26952, 26953). The antioxidant activity of lousewort constituents appears to be related to the number of phenolic hydroxy groups. Those compounds with four phenolic hydroxy groups have stronger inhibitory activities than those with only two phenolic hydroxy groups (26951, 26952, 26953).\nIron chelating effects\nIn vitro research suggests that isoverbascoside and verbascoside, phenylpropanoid glycosides isolated from Pedicularis striata, have iron chelating activity (26939).\nSkeletal muscle effects\nIn vitro research suggests that verbascoside and martynoside, phenylpropanoid glycosides isolated from lousewort, help prevent muscle fatigue, possibly by reducing the effects of reactive oxygen species (26954)."

About 95% of all EMS cases were traced to contaminated L-tryptophan produced by a single manufacturer in Japan (8054, 10288, 10289, 11475, 11476). In 1990, L-tryptophan was recalled in the U.S. and an FDA alert was put into force limiting the importation of all over-the-counter L-tryptophan products (7067, 11477, 11478). After the limitation of L-tryptophan products, the incidence of EMS dropped abruptly (11474).

The available small and low-quality studies have not supported L-tryptophan for this use (110318). Some older research suggests that taking L-tryptophan with clomipramine might improve the effectiveness of clomipramine (10856). However, it is not clear whether L-tryptophan is beneficial when taken along with newer classes of antidepressants. Also, the CANMAT Taskforce cautions the co-use of L-tryptophan with serotonergic antidepressants due to the rare risk of serotonin syndrome (110318).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnxiety. Although there is interest in using oral L-tryptophan for anxiety, there is insufficient reliable information available about the clinical effects of L-tryptophan for this condition.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral L-tryptophan is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nSome clinical research shows that taking L-tryptophan 300 mg orally along with a sugar and electrolyte drink twice daily for 3 days prior to exercise and on the day of exercise improves power output during the last 20 minutes of exercise when compared with taking a sugar and electrolyte drink without L-tryptophan. The improvement in power output increases distance covered by about 5% without increasing perceived exhaustion (91462). However, other clinical research shows that taking L-tryptophan 12 mg/kg after 5 minutes of warm-up and then 6 mg/kg orally every 15 minutes during exercise does not improve time to exhaustion in endurance-trained male athletes (1135). Reasons for the discrepancy are not clear. It is possible that L-tryptophan benefits some measures of athletic performance, but not others.\nless\nBruxism. It is unclear if oral L-tryptophan is beneficial for bruxism.\nA very small clinical trial in adults with nocturnal bruxism shows that taking L-tryptophan 50 mg/kg daily orally for 8 days does not improve levels of teeth grinding when compared with placebo (1139).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral L-tryptophan is beneficial in patients with cognitive impairment.\nClinical research in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking L-tryptophan 95 mg orally with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 720 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 286 mg, vitamin E 16 mg, soy phospholipids 160 mg, and melatonin 5 mg (IBSA Farmaceutici Italia) nightly for 12 weeks improves cognitive function and sensitivity to smells by a small amount when compared with placebo. Patients treated with the combination showed a 1-point improvement in cognitive function based on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scale, while patients in the placebo group showed a 2-point decline (62847). However, these results might not be clinically significant. Also, it is not known if any potential benefit is due to L-tryptophan, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral L-tryptophan is beneficial in patients with fibromyalgia.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with fibromyalgia shows that eating a standardized Mediterranean diet supplemented with walnuts, to supply L-tryptophan 60 mg daily and magnesium 60 mg daily for 16 weeks, modestly reduces anxiety, mood disturbance, eating disorders, and dissatisfaction with body image, but does not affect sleep, when compared with the Mediterranean diet alone.

Improvements also occurred in the subgroup of patients with uric acid levels greater than 7 mg/dL, the point at which symptoms of gout can occur (99883). However, the effect of this combination for gout-related pain is unknown. Also, it is not clear if this effect is due to L-tryptophan, glycine, or the combination.\nless\nHelicobacter pylori.

However, it does not seem to improve psychological symptoms in these patients (97242). One small clinical study shows that taking L-tryptophan orally, 1 gram 20 minutes before bed, might decrease sleep latency and improve mood when compared with placebo in healthy people with insomnia. Smaller doses of 250 mg and 500 mg did not demonstrate benefit (1146). Other clinical research shows that a single 5 gram intravenous infusion of L-tryptophan decreases sleep latency and increases total sleep time when compared with baseline in patients with insomnia (14896).\nless\nMigraine headache.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe body absorbs L-tryptophan from dietary protein sources (10853, 10857).\nDistribution\nBoth L-tryptophan and its metabolite 5-HTP can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (10853, 10857).\nMetabolism\nIn the body, L-tryptophan is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), then to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) (10853, 10857), mainly in the digestive tract (91461). L-tryptophan is also converted to melatonin (62803) and nicotinamide in the body. Intermediate metabolites in the L-tryptophan to nicotinamide pathway include kynurenine, anthranilic acid, kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid (91460).\nExcretion\nFollowing consumption of L-tryptophan, nicotinamide and its break down products, as well as L-tryptophan and its metabolites in the L-tryptophan to nicotinamide pathway are excreted in the urine (91460, 91461). The urinary excretion of one metabolite, 3-hydroxykynurenine, appears to mirror the intake of L-tryptophan and may be a suitable marker for excess intake (91460). Other L-tryptophan metabolites are also excreted in the urine, including xanthurenic acid, N-methylnicotinamide, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, and N-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (91461).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nL-tryptophan is an essential amino acid present in concentrations of 1% to 2% in many plant and animal proteins (5). A typical diet provides 0.5-2 grams of L-tryptophan daily (1146). The body absorbs L-tryptophan from dietary protein sources. After consumption, some L-tryptophan is converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), then to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). Some dietary L-tryptophan is also converted to niacin (vitamin B3) (6243).\nAntidiabetic effects\nClinical research in obese, non-diabetic patients shows that a single intragastric infusion of L-tryptophan 3 grams reduces postprandial glucose levels when compared with placebo, possibly by slowing the rate of gastric emptying (99884).\nAntimigraine effects\nL-tryptophan is a precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Some studies have found that serotonin levels are chronically reduced in people with migraine (103171).\nGastrointestinal effects\nL-tryptophan appears to slow gastric emptying in a dose-dependent manner, possibly through an increase in pyloric pressure (99884).\nNeurological effects\nDepletion of endogenous L-tryptophan can cause a relapse in treated depression and precipitate depressive symptoms in patients with a history or family history of depression, as well as in healthy volunteers (10854, 10855). However, L-tryptophan depletion does not seem to worsen symptoms in people with untreated depression (1136). Additionally, dietary L-tryptophan depletion has been associated with bulimia relapse and deterioration of schizophrenia symptoms (1133, 1134).\nSedative effects\nL-tryptophan can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and is converted to serotonin (10853, 10857). This may explain the sedative effects of L-tryptophan (1143).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using L-tryptophan to increase satiety. However, clinical research in obese, non-diabetic patients shows that a single intragastric infusion of L-tryptophan 3 grams does not reduce mean energy intake after drinking a mixed-nutrient drink (99884)."

The natural protease inhibitors found in soybeans help to prevent the degradation of lunasin (92050, 92068). It is unclear if taking lunasin as a purified extract in the absence of protease inhibitors would result in similar bioavailability.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLunasin is a peptide found in small quantities in soybeans, oats, amaranth, and plants from the Solanaceae family such as black nightshade, jimson weed, and winter cherry (92035). Lunasin is composed of 43 amino acids. The final 8 amino acids in this sequence are all negatively charged aspartic acids, which gives lunasin a histone-binding capacity, allowing it to inhibit positively-charged histone acetylation. Lunasin's amino acid sequence also contains a cell-adhesion motif, which allows lunasin to attach to the extracellular matrix and to enter mammalian cells. Lunasin also contains a helical region that is believed to help lunasin bind to histone within cell nuclei (92036). Lunasin content varies amongst soybean genotypes, ranging from 4.4 to 70.5 mg per gram of soy protein (92035). Production of purified lunasin is expensive; however, less costly methods for extraction of lunasin from plant sources or via chemical synthesis continue to be developed (92035).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro, lunasin appears to have anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, suppression of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide production, reduction of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and iNOS expression, and suppression of nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation (92061, 92062).\n\nIn vitro research suggests that lunasin might improve rheumatoid arthritis. Lunasin was found to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase-3 in synovial cells harvested from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Lunasin also inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of these cells (92038).\n\nAnimal research suggests that lunasin might suppress allergic airway inflammation in asthma patients. In a mouse model of asthma, intranasal lunasin was found to reduce IL-4 production, goblet cell metaplasia, and total cell and eosinophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (92039).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that lunasin has chemopreventive properties. Lunasin appears to interfere with cellular transformations caused by carcinogens. However, lunasin does not alter the cellular morphology of normal immortalized cells or cancer cells in the absence of carcinogens (92035, 92036, 92042, 92044, 92045, 92046, 92047, 92048, 92049, 92050, 92051). An epigenetic mechanism has been proposed to explain these findings. It is purported that lunasin selectively kills cells undergoing transformation. In these cells, carcinogens and oncogenes inactivate tumor suppressor proteins such as Rb, p53, and pp32, which triggers lunasin to take over as a tumor suppressor protein. By tightly binding to core deacetylated histones, lunasin interferes with normal histone acetylation-deacetylation, leading to tumor cell death (92035, 92036, 92042, 92043, 92044, 92045, 92052, 92053). Other research suggests that lunasin's anticancer effects may also be explained by suppression of the nuclear factor (NF)-kB pathway and enhancement of the tumoricidal activity of natural killer cells and the antitumor immunity of cytokines (92035, 92054).\n\nSome in vitro and animal research also shows that lunasin has antimetastatic and antiproliferative effects. In mice, lunasin 30 mg/kg daily for 32 days decreased lung tumor volume by 63%, while lunasin 4 mg/kg daily for 28 days decreased liver metastases of colon cancer cells by 50% (92056, 92058). In vitro, lunasin interferes with the cell cycle at the G1/S phase in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer cells (92049, 92056). In colon cancer cells, however, lunasin was found to stop the cell cycle at the G2/M phase (92047, 92060). Additionally, lunasin inhibits the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro (92055). Overall, these effects appear to be explained by lunasin's antagonism of integrin signaling and suppression of FAK, SrC, Akt, ERK, RB, and NF-kB pathways (92055, 92056, 92057, 92058).\n\nIn vitro research suggests that combining lunasin with aspirin might enhance the antiproliferative effects of lunasin (92049, 92059).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that lunasin exhibits antioxidant effects via inhibition of reactive oxygen species production (92061, 92063, 92064).\nGastrointestinal effects\nResearch using healthy human intestinal mucosa cells suggests that lunasin might be beneficial for gastrointestinal inflammatory and immune-mediated disorders. It induces gene expression for interleukin (IL)-1-beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-17A, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, prostaglandin-E2, and cyclo-oygenase-2. It also downregulates expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, and NF-kappa-beta, and reverses the inflammatory response to LPS endotoxin, downregulating IL-17a, interferon-gamma, and IL-8 expression, and upregulating IL-10 and TGF-beta expression (110681).\nImmune effects\nLunasin demonstrates immunostimulant activity. In vitro and animal research suggest that lunasin acts as an adjuvant to improve the immune response to influenza vaccination. In animals, immunization with lunasin and ovalbumin improved survival compared to ovalbumin alone after exposure to influenza virus (92040).\n\nAnimal research suggests that lunasin might act as an adjuvant to improve allergy immunotherapy in asthma patients. In a mouse model of asthma, intranasal instillation of lunasin increased T-cell accumulation in the lungs (92039).\nLipid effects\nIn vitro research suggests that lunasin might reduce serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol via two mechanisms. First, lunasin interferes with production of HMG-CoA reductase, rendering it unavailable to synthesize cholesterol. Second, lunasin increases LDL-receptor gene expression, reducing the levels of LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream (92035). Research in animals shows that adding lunasin-enriched soy extract to casein protein reduces LDL cholesterol levels compared to casein protein alone (92065).\nNeurological effects\nAnimal research shows that intravenous administration of lunasin causes neuroleptic and cataleptic effects in mice. These effects are purported to relate to lunasin's effect on dopaminergic D1 receptor pathways, as lunasin was shown to have modest affinity for D1 receptors in vitro (92041).\nObesity effects\nIn animal research, lunasin reduces the inflammatory, immune, and pro-oxidant responses to obesity. It enhances the T-helper cell response to obesity-related immune disorders, and reduces lipid peroxidation in liver and adipose tissue cells. It also inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production and macrophage infiltration, and decreases levels of leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-1-beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha (110682).\nOphthalmic effects\nPreliminary in vitro and animal research suggests that lunasin might prevent cataracts or delay cataract progression via antioxidant effects (92037)."

People who are allergic to peanuts can have a cross-sensitivity to lupin (98339, 98348, 98352, 98361, 98363, 98365, 98369, 103846).\n\nOccupational inhalation of lupin byproducts can cause sensitization and allergic reactions, with symptoms of rhinitis and wheeze (98342).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, lupin products that have not been processed properly and contain significant quantities of quinolizidine alkaloids cause serious anticholinergic effects, including muscle weakness (103843).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, lupin products that have not been processed properly and contain significant quantities of quinolizidine alkaloids cause serious anticholinergic effects, including headache, dizziness, drowsiness, anxiety, seizures, and decreased sweating (98345, 98346, 98362, 98366, 103843).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, lupin products that have not been processed properly and contain significant quantities of quinolizidine alkaloids cause serious anticholinergic effects, including blurred vision, photophobia, and mydriasis (98345, 98346, 98362, 98366, 103843).\nless\nOther\nOrally, bitter lupin beans that are not properly processed (debittered) can cause serious anticholinergic effects due to the quinolizidine alkaloids present. There are numerous case reports of these effects in children and adults who consumed improperly prepared lupin products. Symptoms include blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, hypotension, photophobia, constipation, nausea, urinary retention, muscle weakness, anxiety, tachycardia, dry mouth, decreased sweating, mydriasis, and seizures. Toxicity can progress to paralysis of respiratory muscles, causing respiratory arrest and death (98345, 98346, 98362, 98366, 103843). The acute lethal dose of quinolizidine alkaloids for infants and children is approximately 10 mg/kg body weight; the acute lethal dose for adults is approximately 25 mg/kg body weight (98344).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDiabetes. The evidence for using lupin to reduce postprandial blood glucose levels and improve glucose control is conflicting.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking lupin seed flour in a dose containing 22 grams of protein and 12.5 grams fiber at the same time as a 50-gram glucose load decreases blood glucose levels and increases insulin response when compared with placebo, but not when compared with soy (98347). Research in post-surgical patients with type 2 diabetes shows that eating 2 lupin flour cookies (LupinSkinnybik) mid-afternoon produces similar glucose levels to whole wheat cookies or plain sweet cookies for the first 90 minutes after consumption, but is associated with significantly lower glucose levels 90 minutes after the subsequent dinner meal (103840). The lupin cookies also had a greater effect on satiety, so it is unclear whether this additional finding is due to reduced food consumption at dinner. In adults with type 2 diabetes controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents, eating snacks providing 10 grams of lupin twice daily, 30 minutes before lunch and dinner for 14 weeks, increases serum insulin levels and decreases glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels by 0.2% to 0.4% when compared with baseline, but only in patients with a baseline A1C of less than 8% (103842). Other research in patients with type 2 diabetes controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents shows that consuming 45 grams of lupin daily for 8 weeks in foods such as bread, pasta, and cereal at breakfast, lunch, and most dinners, does not reduce mean or postprandial glucose levels when compared with regular versions of the same foods (103841).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking lupin protein isolate 25 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces LDL cholesterol when compared to baseline, but is no different than taking milk protein isolate 25 mg with or without arginine (98316, 98321). Additional preliminary clinical research shows that taking blue lupin seed fiber 25 grams daily for 4 weeks lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides when compared with either a low-fiber control diet or a diet containing citrus fiber 25 grams daily (98350). It is not clear if these reductions would be considered clinically significant, or how they compare with other diets that have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.\nLupin has also been used in protein bars. Clinical research in people with moderate hypercholesterolemia shows that taking lupin 35 grams in a protein bar daily for 6 weeks reduces LDL cholesterol when compared to baseline but not when compared with a casein protein control (98371). Another preliminary clinical study shows that consuming a bar containing about 35 grams of lupin protein and about 33 grams of cellulose fiber daily for 4 weeks reduces total cholesterol levels when compared to baseline (94934).\nless\nMuscle breakdown. Preliminary clinical research shows that consuming lupin crunchy powder 19 grams daily in addition to receiving neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) twice daily for 60 days reduces muscle atrophy when compared to no intervention in patients wearing an orthosis for 58 days (98373). It is unclear if this benefit is due to lupin supplementation or the NMES.\nObesity. Preliminary clinical research in overweight patients shows that consuming lupin-enriched foods as 25-40% of the diet for 12 months does not help maintain weight loss when compared with eating a control diet of high-carbohydrate foods. All patients participated in a 3-month weight loss program followed by a stabilization and maintenance phase for 9 months (98340). Additional preliminary clinical research in overweight and obese patients shows that replacing 15% to 20% of usual daily energy intake with lupin seed flour-enriched bread for 16 weeks does not affect body weight when compared with following a regular diet (98354).\nMore evidence is needed to rate lupin for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "Lupin can cause anticholinergic toxicity leading to death in several animal species, but a no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) has not been determined (103843).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe toxic lupin alkaloids sparteine and lupanine are rapidly absorbed (103843).\nDistribution\nThe toxic lupin alkaloids sparteine and lupanine are widely distributed throughout the body (103843).\nMetabolism\nSparteine is metabolized by cytochrome P450-2D6 (CYP2D6) to 2,3-dehydrosparteine and 5,6-dehydrospartein. People who are poor metabolizers due to genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 are at higher risk for the toxic effects of sparteine (103843).\nExcretion\nIn general, lupin alkaloids are rapidly eliminated in the urine, either unchanged or as oxidized metabolites (103843).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of lupin is the seed, also known as the grain or bean, which can be ground into flour (98362). Lupin seed is rich in fiber, protein, and non-starch polysaccharides (98347, 103844). A 100-gram quantity of lupin seed contains 39 grams of protein, 6 grams of carbohydrates, 32 grams of fiber, and 8 grams of fat (98344, 103840). It is also rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium (103840). L-arginine accounts for over 10% of the amino acid content in lupin protein and is thought to be one of its bioactive compounds (98321).\n\nLupin seeds and other parts of the plant also contain toxic quinolizidine alkaloids. Their levels vary between species, with growing conditions, and from year to year (103845). The quinolizidine alkaloids include lupanine, lupinine, 13-alpha-hydroxylupanine, 13-alpha-tigloyloxylupanine, angustifoline, multiflorine, isolupanine, albine, tetrahydrorhombifoline, sparteine, isosparteine, gramine, and ammodendrine (103843, 103845). Lupin phenotypes with high levels of quinolizidine alkaloids are referred to as \"bitter\", while those with minimal quantities are \"sweet\" (103845). Bitter lupin beans must be thoroughly \"debittered\" before consumption by soaking in water for several days and boiling, or by chemical or biological processes (98344, 103843). A maximum quantity of 200 mg quinolizidine alkaloids per kg of plant (0.02%) has been set for food crops by authorities in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, and France (98368, 103845). There is research underway to breed lupin crops with reduced levels of these compounds (103845). No cases of quinolizidine poisoning have been reported with industrially-produced lupin seed-based products (103843).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in using lupin to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 has a role in cancer invasion and dissemination, and its level correlates with worsened outcomes. Out of numerous tested legumes, lupin seeds demonstrated the greatest inhibitory activity against MMP-9 expression and against the growth of a colorectal cancer cell line (98360).\nAnticholinergic effects\nLupin contains quinolizidine alkaloids, which have anticholinergic effects. In adequate quantities, these effects can be toxic; sparteine and lupanine are considered the most toxic quinolizidine alkaloids found in lupin (103843, 103845). Quinolizidine alkaloids also vary in their binding affinities for acetylcholine receptors and their relative potency at nicotinic versus muscarinic receptors (103843).\nAntidiabetic effects\nGamma-conglutin, a glycoprotein present in lupin seed, decreases blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner in both rat and human models (98341, 103840). Preliminary clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that taking gamma-conglutin 630 mg, 315 mg, or 157.5 mg orally, 30 minutes before consuming carbohydrates, reduces blood sugar levels but does not affect insulin concentrations when compared with placebo (98341). Some other clinical research in diabetic and prediabetic adults suggests that consuming lupin reduces postprandial glucose levels (98347, 98351).\nAntioxidant effects\nPolysaccharides extracted from blue lupins (L. angustifolius) and yellow lupins (L. luteus) have antioxidant effects in vitro (103844).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe quinolizidine alkaloids can inhibit voltage-dependent ion channels in the heart, altering electrical conductivity and producing antiarrhythmic effects. The quinolizidine alkaloid sparteine has been used as an antiarrhythmic medication in the past (103843).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn healthy people, taking lupin fiber daily increases daily fecal weight, decreases fecal pH, decreases bacterial beta-glucuronidase activity, and increases the excretion of primary bile acids. These markers suggest improved colon health, which might subsequently lower the risk of colon cancer (98349, 98355).\nImmunologic effects\nPolysaccharides extracted from blue lupins (L. angustifolius) and yellow lupins (L. luteus) have immunostimulatory effects in vitro (103844). The main constituents of lupin thought to be responsible for allergic reactions in sensitized individuals are beta-conglutin and gamma-conglutin (98339).\nPrebiotic effects\nResearch with yellow lupin polysaccharides has demonstrated that they have prebiotic effects, acting as a carbohydrate source for the growth of probiotic microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacteria animalis, and Bifidobacteria lactis (103844). Preliminary clinical research shows that consuming lupin kernel fiber 17-30 grams daily for 28 days increases levels of Bifidobacterium species and reduces Clostridium species in the stool of healthy people (98370).\nUterine effects\nThe quinolizidine alkaloid sparteine induces contraction of uterine smooth muscle (oxytocic effect). Sparteine was used by intramuscular injection for this purpose until it was removed from the market in 1979 by the US Food and Drug Administration due to the unpredictable occurrence of tetanic uterine contractions (103843).\nWeight effects\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that adding lupin seed flour-enriched bread to meals improves satiety, reduces food intake, and reduces serum ghrelin concentrations when compared with eating a white bread control (98359). Animal research shows that consuming pasta containing gamma-conglutin or alpha-gamma-delta-conglutins from lupin seeds helps reduce food consumption, weight gain, and blood glucose. However, similar results were seen in animals in the control group that were consuming pasta with ovalbumin (98343)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Lutein is a carotenoid. It is the isomer of zeaxanthin. Lutein and zeaxanthin are the two major xanthophyll carotenoid pigments in the human macula and retina (2388, 3225, 60282, 104570). Lutein is found in high levels in foods such as green vegetables, egg yolk, kiwi fruit, grapes, orange juice, zucchini, squash, pistachio nuts, and corn (3224, 60091, 60164, 60249, 60253, 60259).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Consuming up to 20 mg of lutein daily from both dietary and supplemental sources appears to be safe (3219, 3220, 60167). Lutein supplements have been safely used in clinical trials at doses of up to 20 mg daily for up to 10 years (11798, 60133, 60177, 94703, 94701, 100986, 104570, 107107, 108615, 109763, 115134).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. A specific product containing lutein (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) has been used with apparent safety in infants at a dose of 0.14 mg daily for 36 weeks (91163).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in amounts found in foods. The high end of dietary lutein intake ranges from 6.9-11.7 mg/day (3219, 3220).",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, dietary and supplemental lutein is generally well tolerated. Doses up to 20 mg daily have not resulted in adverse effects.",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). When used alone or in combination with other ingredients, oral lutein seems to improve some aspects of vision in patient with AMD. However, it does not seem to slow the progression of AMD.\nEpidemiological research has found that people who consume higher amounts of lutein plus zeaxanthin in the diet have a reduced risk of developing AMD (219, 2394, 60238, 106353). The association between intake of lutein specifically and the development of AMD is not clear; however, dietary lutein levels are much higher than dietary zeaxanthin levels. Although one study found no association between increased dietary lutein consumption and a reduced risk for age-related maculopathy, people in this study already had high lutein intake at baseline (14007).\n\nSome research has assessed whether lutein supplements can reduce symptoms and progression of existing AMD. Clinical research, including pooled analyses, in adults with AMD shows that taking supplemental lutein 10-20 mg daily for up to 36 months modestly improves some aspects of vision, such as macular pigment optical density, the ability of the eyes to adapt to varying light conditions (glare recovery), the ability to see details of near objects (near vision acuity), and the ability to see under low-contrast conditions (contrast sensitivity) (11798, 48213, 60185, 60242, 60245, 60268, 60270, 60280, 90678, 91160)(91165, 97225, 102887, 106366). Meta-analyses of these and other studies shows that taking lutein or a related xanthophyll carotenoid (zeaxanthin or meso-zeaxanthin) improves macular optical density when compared with placebo in patients with or without AMD. Treatment duration of at least 3 months, doses greater than 5 mg, and/or combination treatment with all three carotenoids are associated with a greater improvement in macular optical density (97225, 106366). However, lutein supplements do not appear to affect the progression of AMD (60281). A meta-analysis of 6 studies in patients with AMD shows that taking supplemental lutein 10 or 20 mg daily, with or without zeaxanthin, for 0.5-5 years does not reduce the risk of progression to visual loss or late-stage AMD, neovascular AMD, or geographic atrophy, nor does it improve visual acuity when compared with placebo (113088).\n\nLutein has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients, with conflicting findings. Although not all research agrees, lutein-containing combination supplements might improve some symptoms of AMD (19196, 60134, 60180, 60207, 60237, 60244, 97226). A specific supplement (AZYR SIFI) containing lutein 10 mg, vitamin C 180 mg, vitamin E 30 mg, zinc 22.5 mg, copper 1 mg, zeaxanthin 1 mg, and astaxanthin 4 mg has been used daily for 1-2 years in some research with moderate evidence of benefit (19196, 60244). Taking lutein 10 mg plus zeaxanthin 2 mg in addition to the original Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) formulation (vitamins C and E, beta carotene, and zinc) does not seem to prevent the progression to advanced AMD more than the AREDS formulation alone. However, this progression was modestly inhibited in individuals with low dietary intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin. While progression to late AMD was only modestly inhibited at 5 years when these doses of lutein and zeaxanthin were included in a revised formulation devoid of beta-carotene (AREDS2) (60281), results of an additional 5 years of follow up showed that this revised formulation reduces the risk of progression to late AMD by 15% when compared with the formulation containing beta-carotene (108615). This suggests that lutein with or without zeaxanthin may be a suitable replacement for beta-carotene, which is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in people who have smoked or have a history of exposure to asbestos (113088). Reasons for these discrepancies are not clear but may relate to lutein dose, dietary lutein intake, treatment duration, or the other ingredients included in the combination products.\n\nThe effect of lutein on children of parents with AMD is unclear. In first-generation offspring of parents with neovascular AMD, taking lutein 10 mg, zeaxanthin 2 mg, vitamin C 180 mg, vitamin E 30 mg, zinc 15 mg, and copper 1 mg daily for 6 months does not improve the macular pigment optical density (106347).\nless\nCataracts. Increased dietary lutein seems to reduce the odds of developing cataracts. It is unclear if oral lutein supplementation is beneficial in those who already have cataracts.\nObservational research and a meta-analysis of this evidence suggests that higher blood levels and/or higher dietary intake of lutein are associated with a 25% lower odds of developing age-related cataracts, and more specifically, a 25% to 27% decreased risk of developing nuclear cataracts (90944, 91161, 91162, 112095). Population research has also found that people who consume higher amounts of lutein (6.9-11.7 mg daily) as part of their diet have a reduced risk of developing severe cataracts that require surgical removal (2395, 3219, 3220). Clinical research shows that taking lutein 10 mg and zeaxanthin 2 mg per day orally for an average of 4.7 years decreases the risk of needing cataract surgery by 32% in patients with low dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin; however, it doesn't benefit patients with higher dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin (94703).\n\nSome evidence shows that supplemental lutein might benefit patients who already have cataracts. Preliminary clinical research in adults with grade 2 or 3 senile cataracts shows that taking lutein 15 mg orally three times weekly for up to 2 years can improve the ability to see clearly when compared to baseline (60133).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oral lutein does not seem to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm and low birth weight infants.\nClinical research shows that giving preterm and low birth weight infants a specific product (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) containing lutein 0.14 mg and zeaxanthin 0.0006 mg orally once daily, starting at birth and continuing until 36 weeks corrected gestational age, does not decrease the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia when compared with placebo (91163).\nless\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Oral lutein does not seem to prevent NEC in preterm and low birth weight infants.\nClinical research shows that giving preterm and low birth weight infants a specific product (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) containing lutein 0.14 mg and zeaxanthin 0.0006 mg orally once daily, starting at birth and continuing until 36 weeks corrected gestational age, does not decrease the incidence of NEC when compared with placebo (91163).\nless\nRetinitis pigmentosa. Oral lutein does not seem to improve vision or slow down retinal degeneration in patients with this condition.\nWhile some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that oral lutein might be helpful in the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa (10279), most clinical research shows that taking lutein does not improve vision or other markers of retinal degeneration in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (60117, 60165, 60225).\nless\nRetinopathy of prematurity. Oral lutein does not seem to prevent retinopathy of prematurity in preterm and low birth weight infants.\nClinical research in preterm and low birth weight infants shows that giving 0.5 mL or 1.8 mL/kg of a specific product (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) providing lutein 0.14 mg, or giving 0.5 mg/kg plus zeaxanthin 0.0006 mg or 0.02 mg/kg orally once daily, starting at birth and continuing until 36-40 weeks corrected gestational age, does not decrease the incidence or severity of retinopathy of prematurity when compared with placebo (60240, 60243, 91163, 102889).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for attenuating cognitive decline in older adults.\nClinical research in adults 40-75 years old shows that taking lutein 10 mg with zeaxanthin 2 mg daily for 6 months improves some, but not all, measures of visual memory when compared with placebo. However, other measures of memory and cognitive function were not improved (109763). Preliminary clinical research in older adults shows that taking the same dose of lutein and zeaxanthin for one year modestly improves some measures of cognitive function, such as complex attention and cognitive flexibility, when compared with placebo (106367). Other preliminary clinical research in older females shows that taking lutein 12 mg alone or with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 800 mg daily for 4 months can improve verbal fluency and memory scores when compared to baseline (48216). Also, some observational research in patients 50 years and older has found that higher dietary lutein and zeaxanthin intake is associated with greater word recall when compared with lower intake (102891). However, clinical research in patients over 60 years old shows that taking lutein 10 mg with zeaxanthin 2 mg daily for 5 years in addition to vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and zinc (AREDS) does not improve markers of cognitive function, such as memory and verbal fluency, when compared with AREDS alone (94702). More research is needed to determine whether lutein is beneficial for specific measures of cognitive function in older adults.\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Oral lutein has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking lutein 10 mg, zeaxanthin 2 mg, meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg, fish oil 1 gram (providing docosahexaenoic acid 500 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid 150 mg), and vitamin E 15 mg (Memory Health) daily for 12 months does not affect disease severity when compared with placebo. However, there were modest increases the number of patients experiencing either an improvement or an attenuated decline in memory and mood (109764). The effect of lutein alone is unclear.\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for ALS prevention.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of lutein is associated with a 21% lower risk of developing ALS when compared with lower dietary intake (90412). It is unknown if supplemental lutein has any effect on the risk of developing ALS.\nless\nAsthenopia (eye strain). It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for eye strain.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that some combination lutein supplements might reduce symptoms of eye strain. Results from one clinical trial show that taking a combination product containing lutein, zeaxanthin, and black currant extract daily for 2 weeks improves visual fatigue and eye stress when compared with placebo in patients completing a two-hour visual proof reading task (60214). Other clinical research shows that taking lutein 17.5 mg plus omega-3 fatty acids (standardized to contain docosahexaenoic acid 783 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid 162 mg) and bilberry extract (standardized to contain anthocyanidin 59 mg) daily for 4 weeks reduces symptoms of eye strain when compared with placebo (35470). The effect of lutein alone on eye strain is unclear.\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for asthma prevention.\nPopulation research has found that a higher dietary intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin is associated with up to 30% lower odds of having asthma when compared with a lower dietary intake (109765). The effects of lutein intake alone or lutein supplementation are unclear.\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for breast cancer prevention.\nEpidemiological research conducted in Korea suggests that higher dietary intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal adults and those with hormone receptor-negative status (115126).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Eating more lutein in the diet seems to reduce the risk of CVD. However, taking oral lutein supplements does not seem to prevent CVD events or mortality.\nOne observational study has found that increased intake of dietary lutein is marginally associated with a reduced risk of developing coronary heart disease (14108). A meta-analysis including this and other studies shows that high dietary lutein intake or high lutein serum concentrations are associated with a 12% reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease, an 18% reduction in stroke, and a 25% reduction in the incidence of metabolic syndrome when compared with low lutein intake or serum concentrations (97227).\n\nHowever, clinical research shows that taking lutein 10 mg plus zeaxanthin 2 mg daily for an average of 4.8 years does not decrease the risk of CVD-related mortality or cardiovascular events such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or angina when compared with no supplementation in patients 50-85 years old (94701). Unlike the analysis above, individual cardiovascular outcomes were not separately evaluated in this study. The effect of lutein on CVD in younger patients or in doses greater than 10 mg is unknown.\nless\nCentral serous retinopathy. Oral lutein has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a supplement containing lutein 15 mg, vitamin C 288 mg, vitamin E 150 IU, zinc 9 mg, and copper 1.2 mg (Sante Lutax 15, Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) three times daily after meals for 6 months has no effect on mean best-corrected visual acuity, serous retinal detachment, or subfoveal fluid remission when compared with placebo in patients with central serous retinopathy (97224).\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for cervical cancer prevention.\nEpidemiological research has found that low dietary intake of lutein is not associated with an increased risk for developing cervical cancer (60297).\nless\nChild development. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for child development.\nEpidemiological research has found that a higher dietary intake of lutein in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy is associated with increased verbal intelligence and improved behavior in the child at 6-10 years of age. However, the ability to discriminate between a novel or familiar visual stimulus was reduced at about 6 months of age, and there were no effects on most cognitive outcomes in children aged 3-6 years (107106).\n\nOther epidemiological research has found that a higher dietary intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin in children aged 3-6 years may be associated with modestly improved executive function at 6-10 years. However, there were no effects on most cognitive outcomes in children aged 3-6 years or 6-10 years (109761). Additionally, a small clinical study conducted in India in children aged 5-12 years shows that taking lutein 10 mg with zeaxanthin 2 mg (Lutemax Kids, Omniactive) daily for 180 days improves some measures of cognitive performance, such as attention and focus, when compared with placebo (114698).\nless\nChoroideremia. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for improving vision.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking lutein 20 mg daily for 6 months does not improve vision in patients with choroideremia (60124).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for improving cognitive function.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that increased dietary lutein does not improve cognitive function measures, such as attention, executive function, or memory, when compared with placebo or an isocaloric meal (107082). However, the dietary source of lutein used in the included studies was heterogeneous and any conclusions remain unclear. Doses of lutein ranged from 8-12 mg daily, alone or in combination with daily zeaxanthin 2-26 mg and/or meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 800 mg (107082). However, some preliminary clinical research in younger adults shows that taking lutein 10 mg and zeaxanthin 2 mg for one year modestly improves some measures of cognitive function, such as spatial memory, when compared with placebo (106348). Also, observational research has found that intake of choline and lutein plus zeaxanthin is positively associated with cognitive flexibility task performance speed. However, this association is not present with the intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin in the absence of choline (106354). Reasons for these discrepancies are not clear but may relate to lutein dose, treatment duration, or the addition of other nutrients to the diet or supplements.\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention.\nSome epidemiological research has found that higher dietary intake of lutein is associated with a reduced risk of developing colon cancer (3962). However, most epidemiological research has found that higher dietary intake of lutein is not associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (34481, 106372). It is not known if supplemental lutein has any effect on colorectal cancer risk.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for depression.\nA cross-sectional study in 8655 adults with cardiometabolic disease including diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke suggests that higher dietary lutein and zeaxanthin intake is associated with a 31% reduced risk of depression when compared with lower dietary intake. The study also found that adults with depression had lower dietary lutein and zeaxanthin intake than those without depression. Additionally, the study found a nonlinear U-shaped relationship between total dietary carotenoid intake and the risk of depression among patients with cardiometabolic disease, where the risk of depression decreased with increasing total dietary carotenoid intake up until an inflection point where the risk of depression increased with increasing total dietary carotenoid intake (112098). Further research is needed to establish causality.\nless\nDiabetes. Observational research suggests that oral lutein may not be beneficial for the prevention of diabetes or diabetic complications.\nSome epidemiological research has found that low serum levels of carotenoids, including lutein, are associated with impaired glucose tolerance. This may indicate that taking carotenoids such as lutein might reduce the risk of diabetes development (60161). However, population research has found that increasing intake of dietary lutein plus zeaxanthin does not decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (14004, 97227). Other epidemiological research in patients with type 2 diabetes has found that an increased serum concentration of lutein is not associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality over 14 years (109768).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial in diabetic retinopathy.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking lutein 10 mg daily for 36 weeks has no effect on visual acuity or glare sensitivity in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (97223). Observational research in a small group of patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy has also found that taking lutein 4 mg with zeaxanthin 0.5 mg daily for 4 months does not improve visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, or glare sensitivity when compared with zeaxanthin alone (100986).\nless\nDry eye. Oral lutein has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in adults with dry eye shows that taking a product containing lutein 20 mg, in combination with zeaxanthin, curcumin, and vitamin D3, daily for 8 weeks modestly improves dry eye symptoms, tear volume, and time to break up tear film, when compared with placebo. However, the use of artificial tears did not differ between groups (115134). It is unclear whether these effects are due to lutein, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for esophageal cancer prevention.\nPopulation research has found that people who consume higher amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin in their diet have a 29% lower risk of developing esophageal squamous cell cancer when compared with those with lower intake (91159). It is unknown if supplemental lutein has any effect on esophageal cancer risk.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial in relieving muscle soreness due to exercise.\nSome clinical research shows that taking a specific lutein-containing combination product (BioAstin, Cyanotech Corp.) containing haematococcus algae extract with astaxanthin 4 mg and lutein 480 mg daily for 3 weeks prior to exercise does not significantly reduce post-exercise muscle soreness when compared with placebo (19199). The effect of lutein alone is unclear.\nless\nFractures. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for fracture prevention.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that increased dietary intake of lutein and/or zeaxanthin is not associated with a reduced risk of hip fractures (97228).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for gastric cancer prevention.\nTwo meta-analyses of observational research have found that increased dietary intake of lutein and/or zeaxanthin is not associated with a reduced risk of developing gastric cancer (97231, 114694). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, including populations and outcomes.\nless\nGlaucoma. Oral lutein has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with open-angle glaucoma shows that taking oral lutein 10 mg, zeaxanthin 2 mg, and meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg daily for 18 months increases macular pigment density, but does not affect visual function, when compared with placebo (109756).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that supplementation with lutein does not reduce the levels of total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (109757). Most publications included in this analysis evaluated lutein alone in healthy adults or in patients with age-related macular degeneration, two studies combined lutein with another ingredient, and one study evaluated zeaxanthin alone. The effect of lutein in patients with existing hyperlipidemia is unclear.\nless\nInfertility. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for infertility.\nAn observational study suggests that there is no association between dietary lutein intake and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes including good oocyte quality, embryo transfer success rates, clinical pregnancy rates, and successful term pregnancy rates in subfertile couples who are candidates for IVF (112097).\nless\nLung cancer. Research is conflicting whether oral lutein is beneficial for lung cancer prevention.\nEpidemiological research has found that low serum levels of carotenoids, including lutein, are associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (12874). However, other epidemiological research has found that higher serum levels or higher dietary intake of lutein are not associated with a reduced risk of developing or dying from lung cancer (39690, 60090, 60160). Another large epidemiological cancer screening trial with a mean follow-up of over 12 years suggests that dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin is protective against lung cancer as shown by a non-linear dose response curve, where lower doses of lutein and zeaxanthin are associated with a sharp decrease in the incidence of lung cancer, followed by a more gradual decrease in incidence at higher doses (112096).\nless\nMacular telangiectasia type 2. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for macular telangiectasia type 2.\nIn patients with macular telangiectasia type 2, observational research has found that taking a specific combination of lutein 10 mg, meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg, and zeaxanthin 2 mg (MacuShield; Alliance Pharmaceuticals) for at least 6 months, with an average duration of 15.7 months, was associated with a stabilization of visual acuity. Also, the number and size of cavitations in the macula were reduced (106355).\nless\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is unclear if oral lutein might help prevent MASLD.\nA cross-sectional study in over 5000 adults suggests that dietary intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin is not associated with MASLD occurrence (115125). The effect of supplemental lutein is unclear.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral lutein has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of observational research shows that high dietary lutein intake or high lutein serum concentrations are associated with a 25% reduction in the incidence of metabolic syndrome when compared with low lutein intake or serum concentrations (97227). Additional population research in females shows that the highest dietary intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin is associated with 54% reduced odds of developing metabolic syndrome when compared with the lowest intake. However, when supplements containing lutein plus zeaxanthin were included in the total intake, there was no association with metabolic syndrome (109760).\nless\nMyopia. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for myopia.\nA very small clinical study in adults aged 20-50 years with high myopia shows that taking lutein 20 mg daily for 6 months does not improve macular pigment optical density, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, or electroretinogram measurements when compared with placebo (112099). The validity of these findings is limited by the very small sample size and short study duration.\nless\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma prevention.\nA meta-analysis of observational population research has found that increased intake of lutein/zeaxanthin in the diet is associated with an 18% lower risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma when compared with low dietary intake. However, no dose-response relationship was reported (97229). It is unknown if supplemental lutein has any effect on non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for obesity.\nA small clinical trial in obese middle-aged individuals shows that taking lutein 20 mg daily in addition to following a low-calorie diet for 10 weeks does not affect most anthropometric or cardiometabolic indices when compared with a low-calorie diet alone. However, there was a small beneficial effect on body fat and total cholesterol levels (107107).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for pancreatic cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that increased dietary intake of lutein and/or zeaxanthin is not associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (97230). The effects of supplemental lutein are unclear.\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for Parkinson disease prevention.\nPopulation research has found that higher dietary intake of lutein is not associated with the risk of developing Parkinson disease (91164). The effects of supplemental lutein are unclear.\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for pre-eclampsia prevention.\nSome epidemiological research has found that high plasma concentrations of lutein are associated with a decreased risk of pre-eclampsia (60142). Other epidemiological research has found that the highest dietary intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin during pregnancy is associated with 68% reduced odds of having pre-eclampsia when compared with the lowest intake (109762). The effects of lutein supplements are unclear.\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial in respiratory tract infection prevention or treatment.\nEpidemiological research has found that high serum levels of lutein are not associated with a decreased incidence or severity of respiratory tract infections in the elderly (60152). The effects of supplemental lutein are unclear.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral lutein is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nIn patients in the remission phase of ulcerative colitis, observational research has found that a higher dietary intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin is associated with a reduced incidence of constipation, but not flatulence or feelings of urgency (tenesmus) (106362). The effects of supplemental lutein are unclear.\nless\nVisual development. It is unclear if taking oral lutein during pregnancy can improve the visual acuity or vision health of children.\nSome observational research has found that higher maternal lutein levels are associated with a 22% to 40% lower risk of poor visual acuity in children at 3 years of age when compared with lower maternal lutein levels (102888). However, other epidemiological research has found that dietary intake of lutein plus zeaxanthin during the first or third trimesters of pregnancy is not associated with contrast vision or visual acuity in the child at 11-12 years of age (109759). The effects of lutein supplements taken in pregnancy are unclear.\n\nA small clinical study conducted in India in children aged 5-12 years shows that taking lutein 10 mg with zeaxanthin 2 mg (Lutemax Kids. Omniactive) daily for 180 days improves a key biomarker of vision health (macular pigment optical density, MPOD)when compared with placebo (114698).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate lutein for these uses.",

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nTheoretically, use of the fat substitute Olestra may interfere with supplemental lutein absorption. Olestra lowers serum lutein concentrations in healthy people (2392)\nStandardization & Formulation\nVarious foods contain lutein. There is 44 mg of lutein per cup of cooked kale, 26 mg per cup of cooked spinach, and 3 mg per cup of broccoli (219, 3219, 3220). Although dark green leafy vegetables contain 15% to 47% lutein, they have very low zeaxanthin content (0% to 3%). Corn is richest in lutein (60% of total carotenoids), and orange pepper is richest in zeaxanthin (37% of total). Substantial amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin (30% to 50%) are also present in kiwi fruit, grapes, spinach, orange juice, zucchini, and different kinds of squash (3224).\n\nSome multivitamin supplements contain lutein. Of note, Centrum and Centrum Silver now contain lutein 0.25 mg per tablet, but this is probably not enough to provide much benefit (219, 3219, 3220).\n\nIn supplements, lutein sometimes comes from tagetes flowers (104570).\n\nAvoid confusing lutein with lutein extract (dried powdered hog corpora lutea) formerly used as a source of progesterone (511).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with lutein.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe form of lutein affects its bioavailability. Supplemental lutein 6 mg daily has a bioavailability similar to lutein from spinach. These sources increase serum lutein levels approximately 2-fold after 10 days. Lutein from peas and broccoli appears to be better absorbed than from spinach (60099). Lutein from enriched eggs has the greatest bioavailability. Lutein-enriched eggs providing 6 mg/day for 10 days increase serum levels about 4-fold (15343). Supplemental lutein 6 mg daily derived from marigold extracts increases serum levels by about 2-fold while 12-15 mg daily increases serum levels by about 5-fold (14053, 104570, 114697).\n\nOther factors, such as formulation dissolution, dietary fat intake, and dietary fat absorption due to pancreatic enzyme efficiency, can play a significant role in lutein bioavailability (6133, 15342, 15345, 60131). Water-soluble formulations of lutein or micronized formulations suspended in medium chain triglycerides appear to have improved bioavailability over lutein-in-oil suspensions (102890, 109758). There is no difference in bioavailability between the free or esterified form of lutein, but lutein ester is better absorbed when taken with a high-fat meal or a high-fat product such as mayonnaise (6133, 60223, 60265, 114697). Papayas and mangoes consumed as fresh fruit or juice result in higher lutein bioavailability when compared with dry fruit (60187). Absorption of lutein does not appear to change with age (34509, 60138). Additionally, age and sex do not seem to influence absorption of supplemental lutein (114697).\n\nAfter a single dose, the maximum serum concentration occurs at about 12 hours (109766). Plasma lutein levels after supplementation with a single dose of 10-40 mg appear to be dose-dependent (109766).\nDistribution\nLutein is present in the eye (retina, rod outer segments, and lens), blood serum, skin (epidermis and dermis), cervix, buccal cells, adipose tissue, brain, breast milk, and breasts (10245, 60094, 60093, 60101, 60290, 106365, 115133). Lutein is most concentrated in the macular region of the retina or more specifically in the fovea (60175). Dosing for about 18 days is needed to reach steady state lutein concentration. Accumulation half-life is about 5.6 days (15348).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLutein is a carotenoid that is typically found in combination with its stereoisomer, zeaxanthin. Lutein and zeaxanthin are the two major carotenoid pigments in the human macula and retina (2388, 3225). They are thought to function as antioxidants and as blue light filters, protecting underlying ocular tissues from photodamage. Lutein makes up about 11% of the total carotenoids in serum and about 20% of the carotenoids in adipose tissue. Serum and adipose tissue levels are affected by dietary intake (10243).\n\nDietary lutein occurs in egg, corn, broccoli, spinach, kale, kiwi fruit, peas, carrots, corn, mango, papaya, squash, tomato and other vegetables and fruit (3219, 3220, 3224, 34509, 60091, 60114, 60151, 60249, 60253, 60259, 60273, 60296). Low dietary lutein intake is associated with smoking, drinking alcohol (more than 2 drinks per week), physical inactivity, low serum cholesterol, and other factors (2398, 15346). Higher dietary lutein intake is associated with increasing age and hypertension (2398).\nAnticancer effects\nLutein levels in breast adipose tissue seem to be affected by diet, which could explain the lower incidence of breast cancer with increased fruit and vegetable intake (10243). Additionally, there is some evidence of an inverse association between serum lutein levels and breast cancer risk (10132). Epidemiologic studies have shown that carotenoids, including lutein, might be inversely associated with other types of cancer (3963, 3964). However, there is also some evidence that higher serum levels of lutein are associated with increased risks of certain cancer, including gastric noncardiac cancer and squamous cell carcinoma (60145, 60153).\nAntioxidant effects\nOxidation is thought to increase the risk of certain diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular diseases. Some clinical research in healthy adults and postmenopausal adults suggests that supplementation with dietary or supplemental lutein decreases strand breaks in lymphocyte DNA, which is thought to occur due to oxidative damage (60162, 60295). Clinical research in newborn babies shows that lutein supplementation increases antioxidant potential and decreases total hydroperoxides reportedly protecting newborns from oxidative stress (60217). However, other clinical research shows that lutein supplementation in healthy adults did not affect biomarkers of oxidation such as glutathione levels and erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activities (34464).\nNeurological effects\nLutein is of interest for its potential cognitive effects; however, although lutein is the main brain carotenoid in infancy (107106), evidence of neurological benefit from lutein in combination with smaller amounts of zeaxanthin is mixed (94702, 102891, 106348, 106352, 106354, 106367, 107106). In elderly adults, taking lutein plus zeaxanthin for 12 months does not affect the decline in global or prefrontal gray matter. However, in those with the greatest increases in macular pigment optical density (MPOD), which correlates with concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin in the brain, the decline in gray matter was reduced (106352, 106373).\nOcular effects\nFoods containing high concentrations of lutein such as broccoli, spinach, and kale, are associated with the greatest eye health benefits (3219, 3220). Other carotenoids and antioxidants such as vitamin A, lycopene, alpha- or beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E have not been associated with this benefit (3219, 3220, 3221, 3222, 3223).\n\nEpidemiological evidence has associated high dietary lutein intake with a reduced risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts (2394, 2395, 3219, 3220, 106353). Dietary or supplemental lutein is transported by lipoproteins in the blood and deposited in the retina, where they help form the macular pigment which improves vision health by improving macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and filtering blue light (2389, 10245, 48213, 60237, 60245, 104570, 109756, 114697, 115133). Supplemental lutein also seems to improve contrast sensitivity and glare sensitivity (104570, 114697). There has been some speculation that patients with AMD might have impaired lutein absorption. However, lutein increases serum levels and MPOD similarly in both healthy controls and patients with AMD (15344).\nSkin effects\nThere is interest in lutein for preventing UV-radiation damage. A diet high in lutein appears to reduce UV-radiation-induced tissue swelling in animal models (15347). Lutein may protect against UV-radiation damage due to its antioxidant effects (60125, 60158, 60184, 106368)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of lychee is the fruit. It contains polysaccharides (26964), vitamin C (26218), and polyphenols including flavonols such as procyanidin B4, procyanidin B2, and epicatechin, as well as anthocyanins such as cyanidin-3-rutinside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, quercetin-3-rutinosde, and quercetin-3-glucoside (26962, 26963). Unripe lychee fruit contains hypoglycin A (MCPA) and methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG) (96612). Lychee seeds contain a range of phenolic compounds, including protocatechuic acid, protocatechuic aldehyde, procyanidins, epicatechin, cinnamtannins, rutin, and phlorizin. They also contain diosgenin, gallic acid, glucose, quercetin, litchioside, and aesculitannin (108928).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that the petroleum ether extract of lychee leaf dose-dependently inhibits carrageenan-induced paw edema and cotton pellet granuloma, but not arachidonic acid-induced edema. This indicates that the anti-inflammatory effects of lychee may be due to inhibition of the cyclooxygenase, but not lipoxygenase, pathway (26959). Other animal research shows that an ethanol extract of lychee seeds or a lychee seed polyphenol decreases inflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and nuclear factor-kappa B and inhibits some inflammatory pathways (108928, 116947). Additionally, in animal research, Oligonol, a commercial product containing a lychee fruit derived polyphenol, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (116929).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research suggests that an aqueous extract of lychee seed reduces fasting and 2-hour post-prandial blood glucose and improves impaired glucose tolerance in rats with type 2 diabetes (26960). In other animal research, blood glucose lowering effects are observed with Oligonol, a commercial product containing a lychee fruit derived polyphenol (116929). It has been theorized that lychee might block gluconeogenesis by blocking the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle. Retrospective research in children has found an association between unripe lychee consumption and increased odds of acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy. This effect is thought to be associated with the constituents hypoglycin A (MCPA) and methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG) (96612).\nAntihypertensive effects\nIn spontaneously hypertensive rats, giving an ethanol extract of lychee seeds, 60 mg/kg daily for 10 weeks, reduces systolic blood pressure and improves hypertension-induced kidney damage, including glomerulosclerosis and tubular atrophy, possibly by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress (108928).\nAntineoplastic effects\nIn vitro research suggests that a water-soluble extract of lychee fruit reduces cancer cell growth and suppresses formation of hepatocellular carcinoma cell colonies (26219). Other in vitro research shows that ethanol extract of lychee fruit inhibits the proliferation of estrogen-receptor positive and estrogen-receptor negative human breast cancer cells (26220). Animal research suggests that a water-soluble extract of lychee fruit, administered orally for 10 days, dose-dependently inhibits tumor growth in mice with hepatocellular carcinoma (26219). Other animal research suggests that ethanol extract of lychee fruit, administered for 10 weeks, inhibits the growth of estrogen-receptor negative invasive ductal carcinoma (26220).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research suggests that flavonoids and polysaccharides isolated from lychee have free-radical scavenging and antioxidant properties, reducing lipid peroxidation by lowering production of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species (26963, 26964, 108928).\nCholesterol-lowering effects\nAnimal research suggests that an aqueous extract of lychee seed and lychee seed polyphenol decreases levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides and increases levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in diabetic models (26960, 116947).\nCognitive effects\nIn vitro research suggests that Oligonol, a commercial product containing a lychee fruit derived polyphenol, may have cognitive protective effects by enhancing neurite outgrowth and increasing synaptic protein expression (116929).\nExercise effects\nPreliminary clinical research in young athletes undergoing track and field training shows that Oligonol, a commercial product containing lychee fruit and green tea extract, improves fatigue and tends to attenuate feelings of muscular/articular pain, lumbago pain, and menstrual pain (26962). Other research in male university students shows that taking Oligonol 100 mg twice daily for 7 days improves power output during intermittent high-intensity exercise when compared with baseline (108927). The lychee fruit found in Oligonol has been modified by oligomerization to lower the molecular weight and increase the bioavailability of polyphenols (108927).\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn vitro research suggests that flavonoids extracted from lychee have immunostimulant effects (26961).\nOcular effects\nIn an animal model of diabetes, Oligonol, a commercial product containing a lychee fruit derived polyphenol, potentially alleviates retinal vascular injury via restored total retinal thickness, reduced acellular capillaries, and reduced apoptosis (116947)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Lycopene is a fat-soluble carotenoid similar to beta-carotene, but without provitamin A activity (7896). It is found in tomatoes, guava, pink grapefruit, red oranges, apricots, rose hip, and watermelon. In the US, over 80% of dietary lycopene comes from tomato products (7896, 60484, 60523, 92173).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in amounts commonly found in foods (2406, 7772, 7773). ...when used orally in supplemental doses. Lycopene supplements have been used safely in doses of 15-45 mg daily for 4 to 6 months (60389, 60399, 60482, 102180, 102182, 109431). Some limited evidence suggests that 120 mg daily is safe for up to one year (60372).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of lycopene supplements during pregnancy. Small, low-quality clinical studies have shown conflicting results about the safety of using lycopene 2-4 mg daily during pregnancy (60337, 60428).\nLACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of lycopene supplements during lactation; avoid using in amounts greater than those typically found in foods.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, lycopene is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Mild gastrointestinal complaints, skin rash.\nCardiovascular\nA case of chest pain has been reported in a pregnant patient who was taking a specific lycopene product (LycoRed, Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals) 2 mg daily (60428). However, the role of lycopene in this event has not been determined.\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, lycopene supplements have been reported to cause allergic skin reactions in some clinical studies (60409, 60417). Skin rash also occurred in a pregnant patient who was taking a specific lycopene product (LycoRed, Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals) (60428).\n\nThere is at least one case report of carotenoderma, with a yellow-orange coloration in the stratum corneum of the skin, in a 26-year-old female who consumed 20-30 cherry tomatoes and 180 mL tomato juice, as well as other carotenoid-rich foods, daily for up to 10 years. Plasma levels of carotenoids, mainly lycopene, were elevated (109774).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, gastrointestinal side effects associated with use of lycopene supplements include diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and anorexia (60372, 60384, 60417, 60433, 60464).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nProstate cancer. Early findings suggests that oral lycopene might have a small benefit in preventing the development or recurrence of prostate cancer.\nWhile some observational studies have found a reduced risk for prostate cancer from increased dietary lycopene intake (2405, 2406, 7772, 7773, 7895, 12878, 60304, 60448, 109432), others have found no significant association (34635, 60334, 60449, 60457, 60547). The most recent meta-analysis of these and other observational studies has found an overall modest benefit, suggesting that the risk of developing prostate cancer decreases by 1% for each additional 2 mg of daily dietary lycopene intake, and decreases by 3.5% for each 10 mcg/dL increase in plasma lycopene levels (98824). A subgroup analysis of some population research also suggests that the benefits from increased dietary lycopene may be limited to non-Hispanic White subjects (109432).\n\nFurthermore, a small clinical study in patients at high risk for developing prostate cancer with high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia shows that taking lycopene (Lyc-O-Mato, LycoRed Natural Product Industries) 4 mg twice daily for one year might delay progression to prostate cancer when compared with no supplementation (14126).\n\nNumerous small heterogeneous studies have examined the effect of lycopene on serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. One meta-analysis of 6 controlled clinical trials in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia shows that taking lycopene 15-45 mg daily for 4 months does not reduce PSA levels when compared with control. However, in patients with a higher baseline PSA of over 6.5 mg/L, lycopene supplementation seems to reduce PSA levels when compared with control (105573). Other small, uncontrolled studies in patients in remission or with recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer suggest that taking lycopene (LycoRed, Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals; Lyc-O-Mato, LycoRed Natural Product Industries Ltd.) 10-30 mg daily, or tomato products providing a mean of 43 mg lycopene daily, for 3-6 months reduces PSA levels when compared to baseline (60353, 60397, 60403, 60417). Lycopene might also be beneficial in patients receiving surgical interventions. Small clinical studies in patients receiving orchiectomy for metastatic prostate cancer or radical prostatectomy show that taking lycopene 4 mg daily for 6 months or 30 mg daily for 3 weeks seems to reduce and normalize PSA levels when compared with baseline or control (7771, 60328, 60342). However, not all research has been positive. Two small clinical studies in patients with relapsed or androgen-independent prostate cancer show that taking lycopene 15-120 mg daily for up to one year does not affect PSA levels when compared with baseline (60372, 60384). Many of these findings are limited due to a lack of a placebo control.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nBladder cancer. Dietary lycopene does not seem to affect the risk of bladder cancer.\nEpidemiological research and population studies have not established a link between dietary intake of lycopene or lycopene serum levels and the risk of bladder cancer (2407, 60411, 60496, 60533).\nless\nDiabetes. Increased dietary lycopene intake does not seem to reduce the risk of diabetes or diabetes complications. Additionally, it is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial for the management of diabetes.\nPopulation research has found that increasing intake of dietary lycopene does not decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (14004, 14361). Other epidemiological research in patients with type 2 diabetes has found that an increased serum concentration of lycopene is not associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality over 14 years (109768).\n\nLycopene has also been studied for management of diabetes. A meta-analysis of 2 low-quality clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking lycopene or tomato extract supplements for 3-6 months modestly reduces fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo (114666).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial in patients with AMD; the available evidence is conflicting.\nSome observational research has found that lycopene serum levels in the lowest quintile are associated with an almost two-fold increased risk for AMD when compared with levels in the highest quintile (6110). However, other population research has found no association between lycopene serum levels or dietary lycopene intake and the risk of developing AMD (5922, 10902, 14007, 60585).\nless\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). It is unclear if dietary lycopene helps to prevent ALS.\nPopulation research has found that the highest quintile of total dietary carotenoid intake is associated with a 25% lower risk of ALS when compared with the lowest quintile. However, no association was found for lycopene intake alone (90412).\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral lycopene reduces asthma exacerbations or prevents asthma.\nSome preliminary clinical research in adults with stable asthma shows that taking a specific tomato extract product (Lyc-O-Mato, LycoRed Natural Products Industries, Ltd.) providing lycopene 15 mg three times daily orally for up to 14 weeks does not reduce asthma exacerbations when compared with placebo (60482). However, other observational research has found that a higher dietary intake of lycopene is associated with at least a 20% lower odds of having asthma when compared with a lower dietary intake (109765). The effects of lycopene supplements are unclear.\nless\nAtherosclerosis. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial in patients with atherosclerosis.\nSome observational research has found that higher serum lycopene levels are associated with a lesser degree of aortic or carotid atherosclerosis (1446, 60329, 60463). Some observational research has also found that higher serum lycopene levels are associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction in people with atherosclerosis (7897, 60538). However, there does not seem to be a link between serum lycopene levels and the risk of ischemic stroke (1449).\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Small studies suggest that lycopene products might improve BPH symptoms.\nWhile epidemiological evidence has not found an association between dietary lycopene and the development of BPH (60365), clinical research suggests that lycopene might improve BPH-related symptoms. One small clinical study in patients with BPH shows that taking lycopene (LycoVit powder, BASF) 15 mg daily for 6 months slows the progression of BPH and improves symptom scores when compared to baseline (60399). This finding is limited by the lack a statistical comparison to the control group.\n\nResearch also suggests that combination products containing lycopene might improve BPH symptoms. These products have combined lycopene 2.1 mg with pumpkin seed oil 160 mg, small-flowered willow herb 500 mg, pygeum 15 grams, and saw palmetto 660 mg (ProstateEZE Max, Caruso's Natural Health) once daily for 3 months (92164); and lycopene 5 mg with saw palmetto 320 mg and selenium 50 mcg (Profluss, KonPharma) daily for 1 year (90354).\nless\nBrain tumor. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial for various types of brain tumor.\nA small clinical study in patients with glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma shows that taking lycopene 8 mg orally daily for 3 months does not improve the response to radiotherapy and paclitaxel when compared with placebo (60441).\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral lycopene reduces the risk of breast cancer.\nSome observational research has found that higher levels of lycopene in the blood and breast adipose tissue are associated with reduced breast cancer risk (10132, 34634, 60549, 60555). However, other epidemiological research has found that neither dietary lycopene intake nor lycopene serum levels are associated with breast cancer risk (10823, 15751, 60344, 60468, 60541). Also, some population research has found that there is a possible relationship between low serum lycopene levels and an increased risk of breast cancer in Black females, but not White females (60325).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral lycopene reduces the risk of CVD.\nMost epidemiological research has found that higher serum levels of lycopene and increased dietary lycopene intake are associated with modestly reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including reduced incidence of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality (7897, 9594, 10418, 15749, 60538, 102178, 109434). However, evidence from clinical trials shows that lycopene may not improve most risk factors for CVD. Meta-analyses of clinical research in healthy adults or patients with at least one cardiovascular risk factor show that taking lycopene 1.44 to 75 mg daily does not improve blood pressure, lipid levels, or endothelial function when compared with control (95777, 105575). These findings are limited by the heterogeneity of the included trials.\nless\nCataracts. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial for reducing the risk of cataracts.\nOne epidemiological study has found that serum lycopene levels are inversely associated with the risk of developing cataracts (60203). However, other population studies have found no association between lycopene serum levels or dietary intake of lycopene and the development of cataracts (3219, 3220, 60299).\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral lycopene reduces the risk of cervical cancer.\nEpidemiological research has found that higher serum lycopene levels or higher dietary lycopene intake is associated with a reduced risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer (60429, 60430, 60439, 60566). However, other studies have not shown this association (60388, 60517, 60521).\nless\nChronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Oral lycopene has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome shows that taking a specific combination of lycopene 5 mg with selenium 50 mcg and saw palmetto 320 mg (Profluss, KonPharma) daily for 8 weeks reduces pain scores by 52%, compared with a 26% reduction with saw palmetto alone (60442). It is unclear if this effect is due to lycopene, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial for improving cognitive function and memory.\nObservational research in healthy adults has found that consuming more lycopene in the diet over 22 years is associated with lower odds of poor cognitive function (104468).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if lycopene reduces the risk for colorectal cancer; the available research is conflicting.\nSome population research has found that the highest tertile of dietary lycopene intake is associated with a 50% reduced risk for colorectal cancer when compared with the lowest tertile (2407, 38845). However, other epidemiological research has found no association between dietary lycopene intake and the risk of colorectal cancer, regardless of smoking status, drinking status, geographical location, gender, and tumor location (3962, 34542, 95778).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial for depression.\nA cross-sectional study in 8655 adults with cardiometabolic disease including coronary heart disease, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension and stroke suggests that higher dietary lycopene intake is associated with a lower odds of depression when compared with lower dietary intake. Additionally, the study found a U-shaped relationship between total dietary carotenoid intake and depression among patients with cardiometabolic disease, where the odds of depression decreased with increasing total dietary carotenoid intake up until an inflection point where the odds of depression increased with increasing total dietary carotenoid intake (112098). Further research is needed to establish causality.\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial for preventing esophageal cancer.\nA meta-analysis of population research has found that high dietary intake of lycopene is associated with a 25% reduced odds of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma when compared with low dietary intake of lycopene (91159).\nless\nExercise-induced asthma. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial for preventing exacerbations of exercise-induced asthma.\nOne very small clinical trial in children and adults with exercise-induced asthma shows that taking a specific tomato extract product (Lyc-O-Mato, LycoRed Natural Products Industries, Ltd.) providing lycopene 30 mg daily for 1 week seems to reduce the incidence of exercise-induced asthma exacerbations, but does not improve certain measures of lung function, when compared to baseline (7898). However, another very small study in adolescent athletes with exercise-induced asthma shows that taking the same product and dose for 1 week does not improve post-exercise lung function or reduce exacerbations when compared with placebo (60358). This study may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. Oral lycopene has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adult long-distance runners shows that taking a combination product (Lycored Ltd.) containing lycopene 5 mg, other carotenoids 4 mg, folic acid 0.1 mg, tocopherols 4 mg, and rosemary extract orally once daily for 4 weeks reduces muscle damage associated with a 2-hour run when compared with placebo (98825).\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral lycopene reduces the risk of gastric cancer.\nPreliminary observational research in adult males has found that high dietary intake of lycopene is associated with 0.87 lower odds of having stomach cancer when compared with low dietary intake (109436). However, a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies suggests that lycopene is not associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer (114694).\nless\nGingivitis. Small studies suggest that ingesting or injecting oral lycopene products might improve gingivitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific oral lycopene supplement (LycoRed, Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals) 8 mg daily for 2 weeks, or receiving a single injection of lycopene gel 2 mg into the gums, reduces gingivitis when compared with placebo (60400, 60473). However, using a combination product (Lycotas, Intas Pharmaceuticals) containing lycopene 2 mg, vitamin C 50 mg, vitamin A 2500 units, zinc sulfate 20.6 mg, and chromium picolinate 75 mcg orally twice daily for 2 weeks does not improve moderate gingivitis or mild to moderate periodontitis when compared with placebo in people who have also undergone scaling and root planning (92172).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral lycopene helps to eradicate H. pylori.\nA small clinical study in patients diagnosed with H. pylori shows that adding lycopene 30 mg daily for 1 month to standard therapy with metronidazole, amoxicillin, omeprazole, and bismuth does not increase the rate of H. pylori elimination when compared with standard therapy alone (60480).\nless\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV). It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial in patients with HPV.\nEpidemiological research in females has found that higher plasma levels of lycopene are associated with a faster rate of oncogenic HPV clearance, with an average of 8.5 months, when compared with lower levels of plasma lycopene, with an average of 11-12 months (12177).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Most research shows that oral lycopene doesn't reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels; however, effects on other lipid levels are unclear.\nA subgroup meta-analysis of 3 small clinical studies in adults with hyperlipidemia shows that taking lycopene 7-15 mg daily or tomato juice containing lycopene 2.5 mg 4 times weekly for 8 weeks does not improve LDL cholesterol levels when compared with control (105575). Another subgroup meta-analysis of 9 studies in adults without hyperlipidemia shows that consuming lycopene, in supplements or in tomato products, also does not seem to reduce LDL cholesterol levels when compared with both active and inactive controls (105575). This finding is limited by the heterogeneity of interventions and patient populations. In contrast, one small clinical study in Japanese patients with borderline high cholesterol shows that taking 50 grams of a semi-dried tomato containing lycopene 22-27.8 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces LDL cholesterol levels, but does not affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with taking 50 grams of tomato without lycopene (102180).\n\nSubgroup meta-analyses also show that taking lycopene does not reduce triglyceride levels or improve HDL cholesterol levels (105575). However, a meta-analysis of 14 small clinical trials including healthy subjects and subjects with metabolic disorders shows that taking lycopene 6-75 mg orally daily for 1 week to 6 months moderately improves both HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared with control. A subgroup analysis suggests lycopene may improve lipid levels in unhealthy, but not healthy, subjects. However, the validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity and the exclusion of LDL cholesterol levels from the analysis (109431). Also, a clinical study in patents with ischemic heart failure shows that taking lycopene 25 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces levels of triglycerides (109773). In postmenopausal females, taking a specific lycopene supplement (LycoRed, Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals) 4 mg orally twice daily for 6 months also modestly increases triglyceride levels (109694). However, there was no effect on other lipid levels in either of these studies (109694, 109773).\nless\nHypertension. Small clinical studies suggest that some lycopene products might reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension. However, lycopene does not seem to reduce the risk for hypertension.\nObservational research has found no link between serum lycopene levels and the risk for hypertension (60419). Additionally, lycopene supplements do not seem to reduce blood pressure in patients without hypertension or with pre-hypertension (42079, 105572, 105575).\n\nHowever, some clinical research suggests that lycopene may be beneficial for lowering blood pressure in people with hypertension. A network meta-analysis of 4 small clinical trials in patients with hypertension shows that taking standardized tomato extract containing lycopene 10-30 mg daily for 4-12 weeks reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 8 mmHg and 4 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo. This benefit was not seen with supplements containing only lycopene or tomato products without standardized lycopene content (105572). Specific tomato extract products (Lyc-O-Mato or Tomato Nutrient Complex, LycoRed, Ltd.), were used in some studies (60415, 102182).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial in patients with lung cancer.\nSome epidemiological research has found that higher dietary lycopene intake or serum levels are linked to a decreased risk of lung cancer (2595, 60332, 60363, 60550, 112096). However, other epidemiological research has found no association between dietary intake or blood levels of lycopene and lung cancer risk (60316, 60520, 60522, 60554).\nless\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial in male patients with infertility.\nA small clinical study in males with idiopathic infertility shows that taking lycopene 2 mg orally twice daily for 3 months improves sperm concentration, motility, and morphology when compared with baseline (60340). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nMelasma. Topical lycopene has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with melasma shows that applying a cream containing lycopene 0.05% and wheat bran extract 3.45% twice daily for 12 weeks seems to modestly reduce the severity of melasma, but not the area of affected skin, when compared with a placebo cream. Both groups were also provided with sunscreen and advised to use throughout the study (105569). It is unclear if this effect is due to lycopene, wheat bran, or the combination.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral lycopene has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with menopausal symptoms shows that taking a specific oral combination of lycopene with calcium, vitamin D3, astaxanthin, and citrus bioflavonoids (Cor.Con. International) daily for 8 weeks reduces hot flashes, incontinence, joint pain, anxiety, and depression when compared with no treatment (19198). It is not clear if this effect is due to lycopene, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if a diet high in lycopene helps to reduce weight.\nA small clinical study in obese adults shows that ingesting a drink with a carrot paste containing lycopene 7.6-8.6 mg, along with either high-lutein kale paste or low-lutein cabbage paste, daily for 8 weeks does not reduce body weight or waist circumference, but seems to modestly reduce the amount of visceral fat, when compared with baseline (105574). This finding is limited due to a lack of comparison to the control group, which consumed a carrot paste containing no lycopene.\nless\nOral leukoplakia. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial in patients with oral leukoplakia.\nA small clinical study in patients with oral leukoplakia shows that taking a specific lycopene supplement (LycoRed, Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals) 2-4 mg orally twice daily for 3 months improves clinical and histological symptoms in a dose-dependent manner when compared with placebo (15748). Preliminary clinical research also shows that taking lycopene 6 mg, along with vitamin E 400 IU and selenium 200 mcg twice daily, for 3 months has a large beneficial effect on lesion size when compared with placebo (109772).\nless\nOral submucous fibrosis. Small studies suggest that oral lycopene might slightly improve mouth opening in patients with oral submucous fibrosis. It is unclear if lycopene reduces pain or burning sensation.\nA meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies in patients with oral submucous fibrosis, usually from chewing betel nuts and/or tobacco, shows that taking lycopene 4-8 mg twice daily for 1-3 months seems to improve maximal mouth opening, but not pain, when compared with control (105570). Clinical studies reported an average mouth opening increase of 3.5-4 mm when compared to baseline (60381, 98823, 102181). It is unclear if this improvement is clinically significant. Furthermore, although two clinical studies using specific tomato extracts (LycoRed, Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals; MintovitL by Obsurge Biotech Limited) show that lycopene also reduces the burning sensation in the mouth (98823, 102181), the meta-analysis did not confirm this benefit (105570). The available studies regarding lycopene for oral submucous fibrosis have been conducted in India and Saudi Arabia; it is unclear if these results are generalizable to other locations.\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral lycopene reduces the risk of osteoporosis.\nPopulation research in adults at least 50 years of age has found that high dietary intake of lycopene is not associated with bone mineral density or osteoporosis risk when compared with low dietary intake (107289).\nless\nOvarian cancer. It is unclear if oral lycopene reduces the risk of ovarian cancer.\nSome epidemiological evidence has found that a diet rich in carotenoids, including lycopene, is associated with a decreased risk of premenopausal ovarian cancer (10133). However, other epidemiological research has found no association (60373, 60534).\nless\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if oral lycopene reduces the risk of overall mortality.\nPreliminary observational research in adults undergoing cancer screening has found that moderate dietary intake of lycopene, defined as 5.61-8.43 mg daily, is associated with a lower risk of overall mortality and cardiovascular disease-related mortality when compared with low dietary intake of lycopene, defined as less than 2.79 mg daily. However, higher dietary intake of lycopene of 8.44 mg or greater was not associated with mortality risk (109434).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral lycopene helps to prevent pancreatic cancer.\nEpidemiological research has found that high dietary intake of lycopene is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. Intake in the highest quartile was associated with a 31% reduction in risk when compared with the lowest quartile (15750).\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral lycopene helps to prevent Parkinson disease.\nEpidemiological research has found that neither dietary intake nor blood levels of lycopene is associated with the risk of developing Parkinson disease (91164).\nless\nPolymorphous light eruption (PMLE). Oral lycopene has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with PMLE shows that taking a combination of lycopene 2.5 mg, beta-carotene 4.7 mg, and Lactobacillus johnsonii 500 million CFU (Inneov Sun Sensitivity, Laboratoires Innéov) daily for 12 weeks reduces skin lesion severity after a single exposure to light when compared with placebo (90276). It is not clear if this effect is due to lycopene, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral lycopene is beneficial in patients with pre-eclampsia.\nEpidemiological research has found that the highest intake of lycopene during pregnancy is associated with 45% reduced odds of having pre-eclampsia when compared with the lowest intake (109762). However, results from clinical research are mixed. One clinical study in healthy primigravidae shows that taking a specific oral lycopene supplement (LycoRed, Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals) 2 mg twice daily, starting between weeks' 16 and 20 of pregnancy and continuing until delivery, lowers mean diastolic blood pressure and reduces the incidence of pre-eclampsia, intra-uterine growth retardation, and preterm labor when compared with placebo (60337). However, another clinical study in this same population shows that taking this same lycopene supplement only once daily, starting between weeks' 12 and 20 of pregnancy, does not reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia when compared with placebo. Furthermore, the rates of preterm labor and low birth weight were higher in those taking lycopene when compared with placebo (60428). The reasons for these conflicting findings are unclear; larger, high-quality studies are needed to clarify these findings.\nless\nRenal cell carcinoma. It is unclear if oral lycopene reduces the risk for renal cell carcinoma.\nObservational research has found no association between dietary lycopene intake and the risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (60379).\nless\nSunburn. Small studies suggest that consuming tomato paste with oral lycopene might prevent sunburn.\nSmall clinical studies in healthy volunteers shows that taking lycopene 10-16 mg daily for 12 weeks, in the form of tomato paste or a tomato extract (Lyc-O-Mato), may provide some protection against experimentally-induced sunburn when compared to baseline or control (23012, 60324, 60452).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate lycopene for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nDietary lycopene is commonly found in tomato products. A 130 gram serving of fresh tomatoes contains between 4 mg and 10 mg of lycopene, depending on variety, growing conditions, and ripeness (92175, 92173). Spaghetti sauce contains about 22 mg lycopene per 125 gram serving, ketchup contains 3.3 mg per tablespoon, and tomato juice contains about 20 mg per 240 mL serving (92175).\n\nLycopene supplements are most commonly used in doses of 15-45 mg daily for up to 6 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nAlthough dietary fats increase lycopene absorption (92165), fat substitutes, such as Olestra, seem to decrease lycopene absorption by about 30% (23019). If consuming fat substitutes and lycopene, separate intake by several hours.\nStandardization & Formulation\nSome research has used a specific formulation of lycopene (LycoRed). One soft gel contains lycopene 2 mg with other phytonutrients suspended in a tomato oleoresin oil. Each softgel also contains zinc 7.5 mg and selenium 35 mcg (109694).",

Theoretically, concomitant use of lycopene with herbs that have anticoagulant or antiplatelet activity could increase the risk of bleeding. See other products with antiplatelet activity here. See products with anticoagulant activity here.\nless\nBETA-CAROTENE\nBeta-carotene might alter the absorption of dietary lycopene.\nSome evidence suggests that taking beta-carotene supplements 20-60 mg daily increases the absorption of lycopene from supplements and from the diet (2403, 23015). However, other studies have reported that beta-carotene supplements have no effect on lycopene serum levels (23017, 23018), or that they decrease lycopene serum levels (23016). These differences may be due to other factors affecting absorption, such as whether the supplements were taken with or between meals, and how much fat was present, which increases absorption (94226).\nless\nCALCIUM\nCalcium supplements can decrease the absorption of dietary lycopene.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a specific calcium carbonate supplement (Cacit 500, Warner Chilcott) 500 mg while eating a meal containing lycopene 19 mg reduces the bioavailability of lycopene by 83% when compared to eating a meal containing only lycopene 19 mg. The mechanism of this effect is not known; however, it is suspected that calcium inhibits the uptake of lycopene in the gastrointestinal tract (95578).\nless\nLUTEIN\nLutein might decrease the absorption of dietary lycopene.\nThere is some evidence that taking a single 24 mg oral dose of lutein decreases the absorption of lycopene from supplements and from the diet, possibly due to competition for transport in chylomicrons. However, taking lutein 12 mg orally daily for 3 weeks does not affect plasma levels of lycopene (92165, 94227).\nless",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with lycopene.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nLycopene absorption from tomatoes increases when they are cooked, and when they are ingested with fat (1497, 2401, 7896, 60311, 60573, 92165). Heating and other processing releases lycopene from the food matrix and induces trans- to cis-isomerization of the molecule, which is found primarily in the all-trans configuration in plants (7896, 60311, 60530, 60561, 60562, 92173). Over half of the total lycopene in human serum is in the form of cis-isomers, suggesting they are more bioavailable (1497, 7896, 60311, 60382, 60385, 92175).\n\nLycopene is fat soluble and is incorporated into micelles containing bile salts, cholesterol, and fatty acids in the intestine. These are carried to the intestinal wall, where lycopene is absorbed into the enterocytes by passive diffusion or with the aid of a cholesterol membrane transporter (92165, 92175). In the enterocytes, lycopene is packaged into chylomicrons with other lipids, then transported in the lymphatic system before release into the blood (92165).\n\nIn healthy volunteers, peak serum concentrations of lycopene were reached 4-6 hours after ingestion of lycopene 38 mg in a capsule formulation (Makhleshim, Beer-Sheva Israel) with a meal (60559). After ingesting raw tomatoes or tomato puree containing approximately 16.5 mg of lycopene, serum levels peaked at 6-12 hours (60573). A small clinical study in healthy volunteers suggests that the extent of lycopene absorption from the ingestion of 100% watermelon juice has significant interindividual variability, which might be attributed to genetic factors. For example, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6564851 on the beta-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1) gene was found to be significantly associated with serum lycopene levels (105615).\nDistribution\nAverage plasma lycopene levels are reported to be 0.22 to 1.06 mcM/L (60518, 60536). Levels are inversely correlated with age, with the lowest levels found in patients over 80 years of age (60509, 60527, 60552). Lycopene is transported in the blood primarily by low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (39733, 60530). It is found in high concentrations in the adrenal glands, testes, liver, and prostate, and in lower concentrations in the kidneys, lungs, and ovaries (60394, 60534, 60539, 60562, 92175). Lycopene isomers have been isolated from human breast milk (60542, 92175).\nMetabolism\nInformation on the metabolism of lycopene is limited, but it is thought to undergo oxidation and enzymatic cleavage (60488, 60526, 92175).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of lycopene in adult females consuming controlled diets for 10 weeks was determined to be 26 days, and lycopene was eliminated by first-order kinetics (34467). In another study, the half-life of elimination in six adults ingesting processed tomato juice was determined to be 2-3 days (60345). The large discrepancy between these results warrants additional research.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nLycopene is a carotenoid, but it is not a precursor of vitamin A. It is synthesized by plants and microorganisms and is found in foods such as tomatoes, guava, pink grapefruit, red oranges, apricots, rosehips, and watermelon (7896, 60484, 60523, 92173). Concentrations of lycopene are often higher in processed versions of these foods due to water loss. For example, fresh tomatoes contain from 0.88 mg to 7.74 mg per 100 grams, while ketchup contains from 9.9 mg to 13.44 mg per 100 grams (92165). Daily dietary lycopene intake varies from about 1 mg/day to 10.5 mg/day (92165). Lycopene from plants is primarily in the all-trans configuration which is poorly absorbed, but its high degree of unsaturation allows cis-trans isomerization to occur in response to light, thermal energy, and chemical reactions (1928, 92173). In human plasma, lycopene is present as an isomeric mixture, with 50% as cis-isomers (92173, 92175). Lycopene makes up about half of the carotenoids in human serum, concentrating in the low-density and very-low-density lipoprotein fractions. It also concentrates in the adrenal gland, testes, prostate, lungs, and skin (60488, 60536, 92173).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEarly clinical research shows that taking lycopene in the form of V8 low-sodium 100% vegetable juice (Campbell Soup Co.) daily for 30 days decreases C-reactive protein (CRP) levels by 1.4 mg/dL in females, but not in males, with congestive heart failure. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear (92170). In contrast, research in postmenopausal females shows that taking lycopene does not reduce levels of CRP (109694).\nAntineoplastic effects\nLycopene has antioxidant effects and might reduce cancer risk by scavenging free radicals and quenching singlet oxygen, which prevent oxidative damage to DNA (2401, 7773). Lycopene is also thought to suppress carcinogen-induced phosphorylation of regulatory proteins, such as p53 and Rb antioncogenes, and to stop cell division at the G0-G1 cell cycle phase (60303, 92173). Lycopene may be protective against carcinogen-induced pre-neoplastic lesions in rat liver by acting on cytochrome P450-2E1 (92173). It also reduces cellular proliferation induced by insulin-like growth factors (60486, 60579, 92173).\nAntiplatelet effects\nLycopene and a tomato extract containing lycopene inhibit platelet activation, including that induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen, in vitro (60360, 60375, 92177). Suggested mechanisms include inhibition of thromboxane B2 formation, and activation of formation of cyclic GMP and nitrate in platelets (60360).\nBone effects\nLycopene is of interest for bone density. In postmenopausal females, taking lycopene supplements improved the bone formation marker amino terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP), but had no effect on levels of the bone resorption marker, C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (beta CTx) (109694).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using lycopene to reduce myocardial damage during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. Preliminary clinical research in adults undergoing elective PCI shows that taking lycopene reduces serum levels of creatine kinase, but not C-reactive protein or troponin, when compared with control. Lycopene was taken orally as 30 mg 12 hours before, 15 mg immediately before, and 15 mg 8 hours after PCI (109435).\n\nLycopene has also been shown to increase flow mediated dilation, a measure of arterial dilation with blood flow, in patients with ischemic heart disease (109773).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using lycopene to prevent acne. Clinical research in healthy patients suggests that consuming ice cream containing lycopene might reduce the risk for developing acne by reducing skin peeling and the presence of gram-positive bacteria on the skin when compared with baseline (102179 ). This study was limited by a lack of comparison to placebo.\nFertility effects\nThere is interest in using lycopene to improve male infertility by reducing oxidative stress and improving mood and quality of life (60340, 105571). However, one small study in infertile males with oligozoospermia shows that taking lycopene (21st Century Company) 25 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve mood, stress, or quality of life when compared with placebo (105571).\nLipid-lowering effects\nThe cholesterol-lowering effects of lycopene may be due to inhibition of macrophage hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (60543, 92173) and enhancement of LDL degradation and removal from the circulation (7896, 60543).\nSunburn prevention\nLycopene may help prevent UV light-induced skin damage by scavenging reactive oxygen species and absorbing UVA and UVB wavelengths (60487). The lycopene molecule is changed by these processes, resulting in reduced skin lycopene levels (60510)."

The benefits of topical lysine are unclear.\nDespite one small clinical study that found no benefit (1116), most clinical research shows that taking oral lysine monohydrochloride 1000-1248 mg daily or 1000 mg three times daily reduces the recurrence of herpes labialis infections when compared with placebo (1114, 1115, 1118, 1120, 19390, 19391). Also, small clinical studies show that taking oral lysine 1000 mg daily in up to two divided doses for up to 12 months or 1000 mg three times daily for 6 months reduces the severity and healing time of herpes labialis infections when compared with placebo (1119, 1120).\n\nTopical lysine has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. A small, open-label study shows that applying a specific combination product containing lysine and zinc oxide plus 14 other ingredients (Super Lysine Plus +) topically every 2 hours for 11 days seems to decrease symptoms and duration of herpes lesions when compared with baseline (11051). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.

Although there is interest in using oral lysine for improving athletic performance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of lysine for this purpose.\nCanker sores. It is unclear if oral lysine is beneficial in patients with canker sores.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking oral lysine 500 mg daily may be beneficial for preventing canker sores, and taking oral lysine 4000 mg daily may be beneficial for decreasing the duration of canker sores (19390).\nless\nChild growth. Oral lysine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in children aged 4-9 years old with idiopathic short stature shows that taking a combination oral solution containing lysine, inositol, and vitamin B12 10 mL twice daily along with moderate stretching exercises for 12 months increases height, growth velocity, and serum growth indicators and reduces height standard deviation scores when compared with control. However, the combination product does not impact body mass index or the ratio of bone age to chronological age when compared with control (112280).

The validity of the findings is limited by a lack of blinding and small sample size.\nless\nHypertension. Limited clinical research shows that oral lysine can reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients who have deficient dietary lysine intake.\nPreliminary clinical research in malnourished people in West Africa with deficient lysine intake shows that taking lysine orally 500 mg twice daily for 16 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) when compared with placebo in those with hypertension at baseline. The mean SBP was reduced by 17 mmHg in males and 12 mmHg in females. Lysine supplementation did not affect SBP in people who were normotensive at baseline (104104).\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral lysine is beneficial for patients with hypertriglyceridemia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking lysine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks, with or without vitamin B6 50 mg daily, does not affect body weight, triglyceride levels, or blood glucose levels when compared with placebo in males with hypertriglyceridemia. Furthermore, this dose of lysine, taken alone or in combination with vitamin B6, appears to slightly decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels after 12 weeks when compared with placebo (90642).\nless\nMuscle strength. Higher dietary intake of lysine seems to improve muscle strength in young under- or well-nourished males.\nPreliminary clinical research in young, under- or well-nourished males shows that consuming lysine 80 mg/kg daily in the diet for 8 weeks improves muscle strength of the forearm by approximately 7.5% when compared with a diet containing lysine 25-40 mg/kg daily (90643).\nless\nPressure ulcers. A small study suggests that topical lysine may be beneficial for pressure ulcers.\nA small clinical study in hospitalized adults shows that applying a specific cream containing lysine hyaluronate (Lys-HA, Lysial, Fatai-Nyl Srl; Jasper LLC) topically with dressing changes once daily for one week, then once every 2 days for one week, reduces pressure ulcer size when compared with a cream containing sodium hyaluronate. The effect appears to be greater in patients with more advanced (stage 3) ulcers compared to less advanced (stage 1) ulcers (90641).\nless\nSchizophrenia. Large doses of oral lysine seem to improve schizophrenia symptoms in patients taking antipsychotic medications.\nClinical research in people with schizophrenia not controlled by risperidone shows that taking L-lysine 2 grams three times daily for 8 weeks improves symptoms by approximately 34% when compared with placebo. Negative and psychopathologic symptoms appear to improve the most (90645). In patients stabilized on antipsychotic medications, preliminary clinical research suggests that taking L-lysine 6 grams once daily for 4 weeks improves positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly delusions and suspiciousness/persecution, when compared with baseline. However, this improvement was not significant when compared with placebo (90644).\nless\nStress. Limited clinical research in economically disadvantaged populations shows that fortifying wheat with lysine may reduce stress and anxiety.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that consuming wheat that has been fortified with lysine 4.2 grams/kg reduces stress in females and reduces anxiety in males in economically disadvantaged populations that typically consume cereal-based diets when compared with control (19394).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate lysine for these uses.",
