            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDry eye. Tamarind seed polysaccharide extract, alone or in combination with other ingredients, seems to be helpful in the management of dry eye.\nClinical research shows that a tamarind seed polysaccharide extract might improve symptoms of dry eye (16301, 97766, 97767). Application of tamarind seed polysaccharide 1% eye drops (Visine Intensive 1% EDO, Johnson and Johnson) 5 times daily for 3 months improves symptoms of dry eye, such as blurred vision, ocular burning, and the feeling of gritty eyes, by approximately 32% when compared with baseline. However, it is not as effective as hydroxypropyl-guar eye drops (Systane UD, Alcon Labs, Inc.), which also help to protect the eye surface from further evaporation (97767). Other clinical research in patients with moderate dry eye shows that the application of drops containing a combination of tamarind seed polysaccharide 0.2% and hyaluronic acid 0.2% (Xiloial monodose, Farmigea S.p.A.) 4 times daily for 3 months reduces symptoms of dry eye by almost twice as much as drops containing carmellose sodium (Optive monodose, Allegan Inc.) (97766).\nless\nFluorosis. Tamarind increases urinary fluoride excretion in people with fluorosis, but it is unclear if this improves symptoms of fluorosis.\nClinical research in adolescent males who have dental fluorosis associated with living in areas of India with high levels of fluoride in drinking water shows that taking 10 grams of tamarind daily for 18 days with a standard diet increases urinary excretion of fluoride when compared with the standard diet alone (76982). Similarly, males who use defluorinated drinking water, starting 2 weeks before taking tamarind 10 grams daily for 3 weeks, have increased urinary fluoride excretion when compared with using defluorinated water alone (76989). The studies did not report the effects of tamarind on clinical symptoms of fluorosis.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nPremature ejaculation. Tamarind seed powder does not seem to improve premature ejaculation.\nClinical research in patients with premature ejaculation shows that treatment with tamarind seed powder 130 mg daily for 4 weeks does not change measures of erectile function, ejaculatory latency, or sexual satisfaction when compared with placebo (103852).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCommon cold.

After 90 days of treatment, patients taking 125 mg or 200 mg of the combination twice daily for 90 days have greater improvements in pain, 6-minute walking distance, and 9-step stair climb time when compared with placebo (103853).

This product also appears to improve walking speed, stair climbing ability, and range of knee motion. Similar results were found with a combination product containing extracts of tamarind, turmeric rhizome, and mangosteen (TamaFlex plus, GNC) 300 mg taken daily for 8 weeks (110718). It is unclear if these findings are due to tamarind, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of tamarind.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of tamarind are the seeds and partially dried fruit or pod. Major constituents include alkaloids, glycosides, and anthraquinones (107381). It also contains phenolic compounds, malic and tartaric acids, pectin, proteins, vitamins, minerals, sugars (arabinose, xylose, galactose, and glucose), and volatile oil. The oil contains over 60 compounds, including methyl salicylate and safrole (11). The fruit pulp contains 30% to 40% sugars, and the seeds contain a mucilage, consisting mainly of a branched polysaccharide containing xylose and galactoxylose (97766, 97767, 107381).\nAnalgesic effects\nTheoretically, anti-inflammatory activity of tamarind could reduce musculoskeletal pain, such as knee pain, but these mechanisms are not well established (103853). Some researchers theorize that the polyphenolic proanthocyanidins in tamarind have anti-inflammatory properties and defend against oxidative stress (110718).\nAnthelmintic effects\nIn laboratory research, aqueous and alcoholic extracts of tamarind bark show activity against the annelids, Pheretima posthuma and Tubifex tubifex (107383). Tamarind extracts also have activity against Onchocerca ocheng, which is responsible for the bovine form of onchocerciasis (river blindness) (107384).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that a trypsin inhibitor isolated from tamarind seed (TTI) can reduce plasma concentrations of total leukocytes and inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 . In vitro studies suggest that TTI strongly inhibits human neutrophil elastase, which is implicated in macrophage infiltration and the recruitment, influx, and infiltration of neutrophils in the gut. Researchers hypothesize that an increase in neutrophils contributes to inflammation. Histologically, the study also suggests that TTI reduces mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, prevents chronic enteritis, and preserves intestinal thickness of the submucosal layer of the intestine (110719).\nAnti-obesity effects\nAnimal research shows inconsistent effects of tamarind seed extracts on weight gain. In mice fed high-fat diets, giving a tamarind seed extract for 10 weeks attenuates blood glucose increases when compared with no intervention (103814). Although giving a trypsin inhibitor extracted from tamarind seeds for 10 days does not produce weight loss, it does reduce food consumption and induces satiety by stimulating cholecystokinin and leptin secretion (107382).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn vitro, an aqueous extract of tamarind fruit pulp has strong alpha-amylase inhibitory activity, and moderate alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. These carbohydrate-digesting enzymes normally increase glucose absorption from the intestine; inhibition therefore helps to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia. The tamarind extract also increases glucose uptake from cultured L6 myotubes, indicating that it may increase glucose uptake in muscles in vivo (107381). Additionally, some animal research shows that a trypsin inhibitor isolated from tamarind seeds (TTI) may reduce fasting blood glucose levels (110719).\nAntilipidemic effects\nAnimal research suggests that a trypsin inhibitor isolated from tamarind seeds (TTI) may lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (110719).\nAntimicrobial effects\nLaboratory research suggests that the tamarind constituent, tamarindienal, has antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans, and antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11).\nFluoride lowering effects\nSmall clinical studies show that tamarind increases urinary excretion of fluoride. This is thought to be due to acidification of the urine (76982, 76989).\nHormonal effects\nLaboratory research suggests that tamarind seed extract increases cellular production of insulin-like growth factor 1, improves mitochondrial oxygen respiration, and increases Leydig cell production of testosterone by approximately 17%. Animal research shows that tamarind seed extract increases testicular steroidogenesis gene expression, but that the related increase in testosterone production may be transient (103814).\nLaxative effects\nTamarind fruit pulp has mild laxative properties, but heating causes loss of this effect (11).\nOphthalmic effects\nTamarind seeds contain a polysaccharide with a branched chain structure, similar to the mucin found in the eye which helps protect and wet the corneal surface. Eye drops containing this polysaccharide have shown benefit for dry eye syndromes in clinical research (16301, 97766, 97767)."

Tangerine juice contains esters of beta-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, and vitamin C (28613, 54757). Tangerine seeds contain limonoids (28607, 28615).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal research, nobiletin, a polymethoxyflavonoid constituent of tangerine, shows higher anti-inflammatory activity than indomethacin (28601). In vitro, the tangerine constituents hesperidin, nobiletin, and tangeretin, individually or in combination, reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and have anti-neuroinflammatory effects (28614).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, a tangerine extract inhibits five clinical strains of Helicobacter pylori, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 60 mcg/mL (43416).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro, tangerine peel extract increases apoptosis of cancer cells; the caspase-3 pathway may be involved (28604, 28605). In vitro, highly methoxylated flavones, which are constituents of tangerine peel, induce differentiation and phagocytic activity of leukemia cells (28603). In vitro, limonoid constituents of tangerine induce apoptosis and inhibit the growth of some, but not all, cancer cell lines (28607).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that tangerine peel has antioxidant activity. This effect is attributed to the high polyphenol content (7.6 grams/100 grams) of the peel (53350). However, other in vitro evidence shows that hesperidin, a polyphenol found in tangerine juice, may not protect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol from oxidation (54757).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn a hamster model of atherosclerosis, tangerine juice inhibits development of atherosclerosis and lowers levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (54757)."

However, another small clinical study in children younger than 5 years old with acute gastroenteritis shows that taking this same dose of gelatin tannate along with ORS, starting within 5 days of symptom presentation, does not affect the number of daily watery stools or duration of diarrhea when compared with placebo and ORS (101267). The difference in these findings might be due to the duration of symptoms at the time of treatment initiation, severity of diarrhea, or the use of a placebo control.\nHyperhidrosis. A small preliminary clinical study in patients with palmar-plantar hyperhidrosis shows that applying tannic acid 20% lotion to one palm nightly is less effective for reducing symptoms of hyperhidrosis than once weekly iontophoresis with a glycopyrronium bromide 1% medium (101266).\nOsteoarthritis.

Regular consumption of herbs with high tannin concentrations correlates with increased incidence of esophageal or nasal cancer (12).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nThere is interest in tannic acid to improve glycemic control in diabetes. In vitro research shows that tannic acid inhibited alpha-amylase to a greater degree when compared with a specific supplement starch blocker (Phase 2 Starch Blocker), and also when compared with quercetin, rutin, polyphenon, and other flavonoids and polyphenols from green tea. However, there is concern that tannic acid will complex with protein present in the stomach, inactivating it after oral administration.

Tarragon is considered a rich plant source of potassium (19). It also contains many other constituents, including alpha-pinene, alpha-trans-ocimene, volatile oils, alkylamides, and various coumarin derivatives, such as herniarin and skimmin (49405, 77017, 77021, 77022, 77024, 77026, 77027, 77030, 77034, 77037)(77050, 77051, 106774).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that tarragon is able to suppress, but not scavenge, nitric oxide. Overproduction of nitric oxide has been implicated in the development of a number of diseases (30640).\nAnticoagulant effects\nIn vitro research shows that methanol extracts and chloroform fraction of tarragon inhibit platelet adhesion to laminin-coated wells and change cell adhesive properties, self-aggregation, and protein secretion (77038, 76932). In vivo research shows that tarragon essential oil has high antiplatelet activity and can destabilize clot retraction (49445).\nAntidiabetic effects\nThere is interest in using tarragon for the treatment of diabetes. In mice, oral administration of tarragon for 9 days reduced hyperphagia and polydipsia, without affecting glycemic control (62110). In other animal research, tarralin, an ethanolic extract of tarragon, lowered elevated blood glucose levels by 20% to 24% (77031). Furthermore, tarralin reduced blood insulin concentrations in diabetic mice by 33%. Tarralin significantly decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA expression in diabetic rats; however, in nondiabetic animals, tarralin did not alter PEPCK expression, blood glucose, or insulin concentrations (77043). An ethanolic extract of tarragon inhibited the activity of aldose reductase (ALR2) inhibitor, an enzyme involved in diabetic complications, by 40% (77030).\nAntimicrobial effects\nTarragon essential oils demonstrate antimicrobial activity in vitro, although these effects are weaker than that of many other spice essential oils (39809, 77028). In vitro, tarragon essential oil has demonstrated at least partial inhibition of Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Shigella, Listeria monocytogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36131, 77032, 77040). Tarragon essential oils have also demonstrated antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Colletrotichum species, and dermatophytes (77021, 77022, 77028, 77032, 77040).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal research in mice with chemically-induced encephalomyelitis shows that taking tarragon extract 500 mg/kg orally daily for 33 days increases serum antioxidant activity (106775).\nHepatotoxic effects\nEstragole, a constituent of tarragon, has demonstrated hepatic carcinogenicity in animal research. In mice, estragole and its metabolite, 1'-hydroxyestragole, caused significant increases in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (77042). Other studies have shown that metabolites of estragole form hepatic DNA adducts (49405). Estragole also produced necrotic changes in hepatocytes in female mice (77029). Estragole inhibited the glucocorticoid induction of liver-specific enzyme, tyrosine aminotransferase, and tryptophan oxygenase in female rats, but not in male rats or mice (77046).\nInsecticidal effects\nConstituents of tarragon, including pellitorine, neopellitorine A, neopellitorine B, and herniarine, demonstrate insecticidal activity against Sitophilus oryzae and Rhyzopertha dominica (77019).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using tarragon for neurological conditions, such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease. Tarragon essential oil has demonstrated dose- and time-dependent antiseizure activity in animal models of experimental seizures (77024). At the doses needed for antiseizure activity, tarragon has also demonstrated sedative effects (77024).\n\nAnimal research in mice with chemically-induced encephalomyelitis shows that taking tarragon extract 500 mg/kg orally for 33 days ameliorates neural demyelination when compared with control. In addition, taking tarragon reduced serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-17A (106775).\n\nIn vitro, tarragon oil obtained from France has demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE); however, tarragon oil obtained from Hungary did not demonstrate AChE inhibitory activity (77045). Inhalation of tarragon oil might increase sympathetic activity, as evidenced by low-frequency amplitude of systolic blood pressure in humans (49420).\n\nIn vitro, tarragon extract also inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and MAO-B enzymes. In vitro research suggests that the constituents herniarin and skimmin are responsible for the MAO inhibitory activity of tarragon (106774).\nWeight loss effects\nAnimal research in obese mice fed a high-fat diet shows that taking tarragon extract for 4 weeks improves markers of fat oxidation, but not body weight, body fat composition, or glucose tolerance, when compared with control (106776)."

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Most available research suggests that oral tart cherry modestly improves muscular strength and endurance when compared with control. However, most studies are limited by a high risk of selection bias.\nA meta-analysis of 14 small studies involving a total of 303 trained athletes and untrained healthy adults shows that tart cherry might modestly improve recovery of muscular strength and power when compared with control. Also, some subgroup analyses show that tart cherry may improve recovery of jump height and sprint time when compared with control (105629). Another meta-analysis, along with a more recent clinical study, involving marathon runners, cyclists, or triathletes at various levels of training, shows that taking tart cherry juice concentrate or powder 1.5 hours before exercise, or for up to 7 days prior to exercise, improves exercise endurance, as measured by the time to complete an exercise time trial, when compared with control (102340, 116151). Both meta-analyses have a high risk of selection bias and some have high heterogeneity. Additionally, not all data agree. A small clinical study does not find that tart cherry juice improves exercise performance or recovery in adults (116142).\n\nSpecific products assessed in the meta-analyses above include tart cherry juice (CherryActive, Active Edge Nutrition) 60 mL, 90 minutes prior exercise (98699); a specific tart cherry concentrate (CherryActive, Active Edge Nutrition) 30 mL twice daily for 8 days (93149); and a specific freeze-dried tart cherry supplement (CherryPURE, Shoreline Fruit LLC) 480 mg daily 7 days before, on the day of, and 2 days after exercise (93158).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. It is unclear if oral tart cherry is beneficial in patients with aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia (AIIA).\nPreliminary clinical research in a small group of females with non-metastatic, hormone-receptor positive breast cancer and AIIA after taking aromatase inhibitors for at least 4 weeks shows that taking tart cherry juice concentrate 30 mL daily for 6 weeks reduces pain scores on a visual analog scale by about 35%, compared with 1% in those taking placebo (109657).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral tart cherry juice is beneficial in children with ADHD.\nA small clinical study in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years with ADHD shows that consuming tart cherry juice concentrate 75 mL twice daily for 2 weeks with standard treatment does not improve ADHD symptoms including cognitive impairment, hyperactivity, impulsivity, or oppositional behavior when compared with placebo (112815).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral tart cherry improves cognitive function.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy, middle-aged adults shows that taking tart cherry juice concentrate 30 mL orally twice daily for 3 months reduces mental fatigue and improves performance on tests evaluating sustained attention, psychomotor speed, and alertness when compared with placebo. However, it does not affect sleep quality or cerebral blood flow (109655).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Research on the use of oral tart cherry juice or supplements for the reduction of exercise-induced muscle soreness is conflicting.\nA meta-analysis of 12 small studies in trained athletes and untrained healthy adults shows that tart cherry might modestly attenuate delayed muscle soreness after exercise involving maximal muscle contractions or maximal effort sprints when compared with control. However, tart cherry juice seems to be no better than placebo for improving delayed muscle soreness after prolonged aerobic exercise (105629). These findings are limited by a high risk of selection bias, high heterogeneity, and imprecision. Some products assessed in the meta-analysis include a specific Montmorency tart cherry concentrate (Holland & Barrett Ltd.) 30 mL twice daily for 5 days before, on the day of, and for 2 days after intermittent sprint exercises (102341); a specific freeze-dried tart cherry supplement (CherryPURE, Shoreline Fruit LLC) 480 mg daily for 7 days before, on the day of, and 2 days after running a half-marathon or doing back squats (93157, 93158); a specific Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate (CherryActive, Active Edge Nutrition) 30 mL diluted in water and taken twice daily for 8 days (93149, 93151, 101880, 102344); and a specific juice (Sour cherry juice, Cherrypharm Inc.) containing 90% tart cherry juice and 10% apple juice as a sweetener, twice daily (93152, 93154).\n\nSome individual clinical studies have yielded mixed findings. One clinical study in professional rugby players shows that taking a Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate gel, 30 mL (equivalent to 100 cherries) twice daily for 2 days before, on the day of, and for 2 days after a match does not improve muscle soreness when compared with placebo (102339). Similarly, in male professional soccer players, taking tart cherry juice, 60 mL before and after a 90-minute match and then 12 and 36 hours later, does not improve subjective muscle soreness when compared with placebo (102342). Also, a small study in healthy males shows that taking a specific tart cherry supplement (Tart Cherry Extract Powder NordicCherry, Specnova, LLC.) 500 mg daily for 7 days prior to performing resistance exercise does not reduce muscle soreness when compared with placebo (105631). In contrast, a small clinical study in recreational long-distance runners shows that drinking a specific tart cherry juice (Cherrish, Cherrish Corp.) 10.5 ounces twice daily for 7 days prior to a long-distance race decreases post-race muscle pain by around 65% when compared with placebo (93156).\n\nReasons for the discrepancies may include differences in tart cherry products, the small number of subjects, and heterogeneity in study populations and evaluated endpoints. In some studies, the subjects' normal diets were continued during the study, whereas in others, a reduced polyphenol diet was consumed for the duration of the study (102342, 105629).\nless\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. It is unclear if oral tart cherry juice reduces the risk of exercise-induced respiratory infections.\nA small clinical study in recreational athletes shows that drinking a specific juice blend (Sour cherry juice, Cherrypharm Inc.), containing 90% tart cherry juice and 10% apple juice as a sweetener, 8 ounces twice daily for 5 days before, on the day of, and 2 days after running a marathon, decreases the risk for upper respiratory tract symptoms such as cough, sore throat, congestion, and sneezing when compared with placebo (93168).\nless\nFibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral tart cherry improves symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia.\nA very small clinical study in females with fibromyalgia participating in an eccentric exercise program shows that taking a specific tart cherry concentrate (Cherrish, Cherrish Corp.) 10.5 ounces twice daily for 14 days does not improve pain or muscle strength when compared with placebo (93192).\nless\nGout. It is unclear if oral tart cherry juice reduces symptoms of gout; research is conflicting.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that tart cherry juice lowers serum urate and increases urinary urate excretion in healthy people, as well as people with hyperuricemia that has not progressed to gout (93166, 102338). However, in patients with gout, taking Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate (Cherryvite) in doses of 7.5-30 mL twice daily for 28 days does not affect urate excretion or the frequency of gout flares (102343).\n\nTart cherry has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small, unblinded clinical study in adults with chronic gout shows that taking a combination product (GoutFighter, MaxBiocare Pty Ltd.) containing tart cherry fruit extract 100 mg, celery seed extract 300 mg, devil's claw tuber extract 150 mg, folic acid 90 mcg, potassium citrate 50 mg, and ascorbic acid 50 mg orally, as 2 tablets twice daily for 45 days, modestly reduces mean serum uric acid levels and reduces perceived pain and frequency of joint swelling when compared to baseline (106488). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. A moderate-sized, open-label clinical study in adult males with gout shows that adding an oral 25% tart cherry and citrate mixture twice daily to febuxostat for 12 weeks reduces serum urate levels from baseline but not when compared with sodium bicarbonate or a citrate mixture. The average number of gout flares is reduced when compared with sodium bicarbonate but is comparable to the citrate mixture group (116150). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons. It is unclear if any of the effects are due to tart cherry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral tart cherry juice reduces blood pressure; research is conflicting.\nA very small clinical study in males with mild hypertension shows that taking 60 mL of a specific tart cherry concentrate (CherryActive, Active Edge Nutrition) modestly decreases systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure 1-3 hours after consumption when compared with placebo (93155). This finding is limited by the small study size and the use of a single dose. Another small study in healthy adults without hypertension shows that drinking 30 mL of Montmorency tart cherry concentrate (Cherry Marketing Institute) diluted in 240 mL of water daily for 3 months does not reduce blood pressure when compared with baseline or placebo (105633).\nless\nInsomnia. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral tart cherry juice may modestly improve sleep and reduce insomnia. This effect might be due to the melatonin content in tart cherry juice. However, the evidence is conflicting.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults less than 40 years of age shows that consuming a specific tart cherry juice concentrate (CherryActive, Active Edge Nutrition) 30 mL standardized to contain 1.42 mcg/mL of melatonin twice daily for 7 days modestly increases total sleep time and efficiency when compared with placebo (17199). Another small clinical study in adults aged 65 years and older with chronic insomnia shows that drinking a specific juice blend (Sour cherry juice, Cherrypharm Inc.), containing 90% tart cherry juice and 10% apple juice as a sweetener, 8 ounces twice daily for 14 days, modestly improves insomnia severity, but not sleep latency, when compared with placebo (17403). However, another very small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking Montmorency tart cherry juice 240 mL twice daily or powdered Montmorency tart cherry capsules 1000 mg daily for 30 days does not improve sleep quality, sleep time, or serum melatonin concentration when compared with placebo (112813). Furthermore, a small crossover clinical study in adults with overweight or obesity and self-reported poor sleep quality or insomnia shows that taking Montmorency tart cherry powder capsules (CherryPURE Tart Cherry Powder, Shoreline Fruit) 500 mg one hour before bed for 14 days does not improve objective sleep outcomes or subjective sleep scores when compared with placebo (116145).\n\nThe effects of tart cherry on sleep measures have also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A very small crossover study in healthy adults without a sleep disorder shows that taking a combination product containing tart cherry powder 220 mg, tryptophan, glycine, magnesium, and L-theanine 2 hours before bedtime for 3 nights decreases the time to fall asleep by about 24 minutes, increases total sleep duration by about 22 minutes, improves sleep efficiency, and reduces morning sleepiness, but does not improve the total time in bed or wakefulness after falling asleep when compared with placebo (111184). It is unclear if these effects are due to tart cherry, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral tart cherry juice does not seem to improve cardiovascular or metabolic biomarkers in patients at risk for or with metabolic syndrome.\nThree meta-analyses of small, moderate-quality clinical studies in healthy adults, patients with metabolic syndrome, or those with risk factors for metabolic syndrome, that include many of the same studies, show that drinking tart cherry juice 30-480 mL daily for 1-12 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, lipid profiles, blood pressure, body weight, body mass index, fat mass, percentage body fat, or waist circumference when compared with placebo (112812, 112814, 116147).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral tart cherry juice is beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis.\nA small clinical study in patients with osteoarthritis shows that drinking a specific juice blend (Sour cherry juice, Cherrypharm Inc.) containing 90% tart cherry juice and 10% apple juice as a sweetener, 8 ounces twice daily for 6 weeks, does not improve pain, stiffness, function, walking speed, or acetaminophen use when compared with placebo (93160). The validity of this finding is limited because the trial was not adequately powered to detect small differences between groups.\nless\nRange of motion. It is unclear if oral tart cherry is beneficial for range of motion.\nA small clinical study in healthy, recreationally active adults shows that taking tart cherry extract capsules containing about 132 mg anthocyanins and 612 mg polyphenols twice daily for 4 days does not improve range of motion following a maximal eccentric exercise protocol when compared with placebo (116149).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral tart cherry is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).\nA small clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate UC shows that consuming Montmorency tart cherry concentrate (Montmorency Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate, King Orchards) 30 mL twice daily diluted in 100 mL water for 6 weeks modestly improves patient-reported quality of life and symptom scores and reduces fecal calprotectin when compared with placebo (116146). The validity of these results is limited by heterogenous methods, including the use of differing baseline treatment medications among participants.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate tart cherry for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nTart cherry juice is commonly consumed in doses of 240-480 mL daily. Tart cherry juice concentrate, 30-60 mL diluted in water, is taken daily for up 3 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nThere is insufficient reliable information about the standardization of tart cherry. However, the anthocyanin content of certain commercially available tart cherry products has been quantified (93149, 93151, 93152, 93154, 93156, 93157, 93158, 93160, 93168, 93192).\n\nA specific tart cherry and apple juice proprietary blend (Sour cherry juice, Cherrypharm Inc.) is reported to contain 450-600 mg of phenolic compounds and 30-40 mg of anthocyanins per 8 or 12 ounce serving. This is equivalent to 50-60 tart cherries (93152, 93154, 93160, 93168).\n\nA specific tart cherry concentrate (CherryActive, Active Edge Nutrition) contains the equivalent of about 90-100 tart cherries per 30 mL serving (17199, 93155, 93173, 93179). The amount of phenolic compounds in this product is 178.8 gallic acid equivalents per liter, and the anthocyanin content ranges from 2.2 mg per serving up to 273.5 mg per serving (93149, 93151). The reason for the wide range is unclear. This product is also reported to contain 42.6 mcg of melatonin per 30 mL serving (17199).\n\nAnother specific tart cherry concentrate (Cherrish, Cherrish Corp.) contains 600 mg of phenolic compounds and 40 mg of anthocyanins per 10.5 ounce bottle, equivalent to 45-60 tart cherries (93156, 93192).\n\nA specific freeze-dried tart cherry supplement (CherryPURE, Shoreline Fruit LLC) contains phenolic compounds and anthocyanins equivalent to approximately 17.4 ounces of tart cherry juice per capsule (93157, 93158).\n\nSome research suggests that the anthocyanin and phenolic content is higher in tart cherry juice concentrate and frozen tart cherries than in canned and dried tart cherries (93182). Processing of tart cherries may decrease their anthocyanin content by up to 90% (93189). Some research also shows that the anthocyanin content in pasteurized tart cherry juice declines significantly during storage, with up to 75% of the original anthocyanin concentration lost after 6 months of storage at room temperature (93178).",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with tart cherry.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter tart cherry ingestion, key phenolic compounds and anthocyanins (vanillic acid, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside) are detectable in plasma (116148). Some pharmacokinetic research shows that protocatechuic acid and vanillic acid reach peak levels in the plasma 1-2 hours after ingestion of tart cherries, with trace amounts detectable 8 hours after ingestion. Another phenolic acid, chlorogenic acid, was not detectable in plasma following tart cherry consumption, suggesting that it is not bioavailable (93173). The time to maximum serum concentration for cyanidin metabolites is between 2 and 4 hours (93186).\nMetabolism\nSome preliminary pharmacokinetic research suggests that anthocyanins from tart cherry undergo enterohepatic metabolism (93186).\nExcretion\nSome preliminary pharmacokinetic research shows that both unmodified anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites are found in the urine after consumption of whole tart cherries (93186).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of tart cherry are the fruit, seed, and stem. Tart cherry fruit contains carbohydrates, proteins, vitamin C, vitamin A, alpha-linolenic acid, vitamin E, beta-carotene, folic acid, thiamine, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, tannins, anthocyanins, and other phenolic compounds (chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, and vanillic acid) (4282, 17199, 93159, 93173, 93175, 116148). While Balaton and Montmorency tart cherries contain the same anthocyanins, their concentration is approximately 6-times higher in the Balaton compared to the Montmorency variety (93159). Tart cherry also contains antioxidants including kaempferol, quercetin, melatonin, and hydroxycinnamic acids (4282, 4283, 16409, 93174). Compared to sweet cherries, tart cherries contain larger amounts of vitamin A, beta-carotene, anthocyanins, and phenolics (93169, 93174). Most of the anthocyanins and phenolic compounds are found in the skin of tart cherries (93176). The melatonin content seems to vary between different varieties of tart cherry. Montmorency tart cherries contain about 13 ng of melatonin per gram of fruit, and Balaton tart cherries contain about 2 ng of melatonin per gram of fruit (16409). The stem of the tart cherry contains an isoflavone constituent, prunetin 5-O-beta-D-glycopyranoside (4284). Around one-third of the content of tart cherry seeds is oils such as oleic acid, triglycerides, tocopherols, and tocotrienols. The remaining two-thirds of the content is flavonoids, anthocyanins, and catechins (93163).\nAnalgesic effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that anthocyanins from tart cherry decrease pain, with similar efficacy to indomethacin. The analgesic effect is thought to be due to anti-inflammatory activity (93188).\nAnti-gout effects\nResearch in rats shows that tart cherry juice inhibits hepatic xanthine oxidase activity, reducing uric acid production (102343). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific tart cherry product (CherryActive, Active Edge Nutrition) 30-60 mL decreases serum urate and increases urinary urate excretion in healthy people (93166). In overweight and obese people with or without hyperuricemia who have not progressed to gout, drinking tart cherry juice 240 mL daily for 4 weeks reduces serum uric acid by about 19% when compared with placebo. However, in people with gout, taking Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate (Cherryvite), 7.5-30 mL twice daily for 28 days, does not affect urinary urate excretion or the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for serum urate levels (102343). In healthy adults, consuming tart cherry juice (Cheribundi) 480 mL, or a specific supplement (CherryPURE, Shoreline Fruit) containing 480-960 mg freeze-dried tart cherries, as a single dose seems to reduce uric acid by an average of 8% for up to 8 hours post-ingestion (105630).\n\nIt is possible that the uricosuric effect of start cherry may be sufficient to reduce serum urate levels in people with normal kidney function, but not in those with gout or reduced kidney function (102343). Other mechanisms by which tart cherry may reduce gout symptoms include reducing levels of the proinflammatory cytokines C-reactive protein and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity and scavenging nitric oxide radicals (102338, 102343).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAlthough one clinical study found no anti-inflammatory effects after a single dose of tart cherry (105630), other clinical studies (93164, 93165) and animal studies (93170, 93183, 93194) show that tart cherry given in multiple doses for at least 7 days does have anti-inflammatory effects. In vitro research confirms these findings (93182, 93184, 93191, 93193). One laboratory study shows that compounds found in tart cherry may have anti-inflammatory activity ten times stronger than that of aspirin (6). Some in vitro research shows that tart cherries inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) II to a similar degree as naproxen and ibuprofen (93184) and that Balaton tart cherries have higher COX II inhibitory activity compared with Montmorency tart cherries (93193). Additionally, tart cherries inhibit around 25% to 30% of COX I activity in vitro, compared with 45% to 55% with naproxen and ibuprofen (93184). Other in vitro research shows that Balaton tart cherries inhibit up to 50% of COX I activity (93193). Tart cherry juice concentrate appears to inhibit COX-1 activity to a higher degree than frozen, canned, or dried tart cherries (93182).\n\nIn vitro studies also show that tart cherry seed extract (SCSE) suppresses tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 from CD3+ T-lymphocytes in patients with diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis compared to control cells, suggesting that SCSE may have therapeutic potential in these and other chronic inflammatory disorders. These effects are thought to be related to increased heme oxygenase -1 (HO-1) expression induced by SCSE (93180, 93181). HO-1 is an enzyme believed to protect tissue from oxidative and cellular stressors (93167, 93187). A meta-analysis of 10 studies in healthy and/or overweight adults shows that oral tart cherry decreases C-reactive protein levels in healthy adults under 51 years of age, but does not affect interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels (109656). Conversely, a clinical study in healthy adults shows that tart cherry juice reduces TNF-alpha levels, but does not affect other inflammatory markers (109654).\nAntibacterial effects\nTart cherry is of interest as an ingredient in chewing gum to prevent dental caries. In vitro, tart cherry juice inhibits the growth of various oral pathogenic bacteria. In human research, chewing gum containing tart cherry has bactericidal activity against Streptococcus mutans (98698). In other human research in healthy adults, taking tart cherry daily for 30 days has no effect on the composition of the gut microbiome (109654).\nAntidiabetes effects\nTart cherry has a low glycemic index and might be a good dietary choice in diabetes. Preliminary research in healthy females shows that eating muffins enriched with 20% or 30% tart cherry pulp modestly decreases postprandial glucose when compared with eating regular muffins (93148). Animal research shows that tart cherry may decrease blood glucose levels by enhancing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma activity, which is the mechanism by which thiazolidinedione drugs work (93185). However, clinical research in healthy adults and patients with metabolic syndrome shows that drinking tart cherry juice daily for up to 3 months does not reduce fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo (105632, 105633). Other clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking tart cherry daily for 30 days does not affect insulin or glycated hemoglobin levels (109654).\nAntihypertensive effects\nA meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials evaluating healthy adults, as well as those with metabolic syndrome, shows that oral tart cherry juice, taken in doses ranging from 130 mL to 480 mL daily, does not affect systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (109658). It is unclear whether tart cherry may have an effect in adults with high blood pressure.\nAntioxidant effects\nClinical research (93161, 93164, 93165, 93179, 93186), animal studies (93170, 93183, 93185), and in vitro research (93150, 93159, 93176, 93177, 93182, 93184, 93191, 93193, 93195) show that tart cherry has antioxidant effects. Cyanidin and its derivatives are thought to be significant contributors to the antioxidant capacity of tart cherry (93177). In humans, the antioxidant effects of tart cherries peak 1 hour after consumption and again 8-12 hours after consumption. The enterohepatic metabolism of tart cherry anthocyanins is thought to explain this biphasic antioxidant response (93186). Some in vitro research shows that tart cherry juice concentrate and dried tart cherries have increased antioxidant capacity compared with canned or frozen tart cherries (93182).\nBone effects\nA small clinical study in healthy females aged 65-85 years suggests that drinking Montmorency tart cherry juice 240 mL twice daily for 90 days does not affect bone-specific alkaline phosphatase or osteocalcin levels, but reduces tartrate resistant acid phosphatase type 5b levels when compared with baseline, suggesting a reduction in bone resorption (105628).\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research shows that tart cherry might have cardioprotective effects (93162, 93167, 93171, 93187). Some animal research shows that tart cherry seed extract (SCSE) might improve cardiac function post-myocardial infarction via upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). This HO-1 enzyme is believed to protect tissue, including cardiac tissue, from oxidative and cellular stressors (93167, 93187). Other animal research shows that SCSE improves cardiac function, decreases plaque formation, and decreases infarct size in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. The mechanism of action is believed to be increased HO-1 and cyclooxygenase activity (93171).\nCytotoxic effects\nSome in vitro and animal research shows that tart cherry might have chemopreventive and cytotoxic effects (93172, 93196). In mice, tart cherry and its constituent anthocyanins and cyanidins decrease cecal adenoma compared to control. However, the growth and numbers of colonic tumors are not affected. In vitro, anthocyanins and cyanidins from tart cherry are not cytotoxic but decrease the growth of human colon cancer cells. These effects are thought to be due to inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor kinase by tart cherry (93172).\nErgogenic effects\nResearch on the effects of tart cherry juice for improving exercise endurance has produced conflicting results. However, various mechanisms of action have been suggested. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of tart cherry may reduce inflammation and oxidative stress associated with exercise. Also, tart cherry has a lower glycemic index than other carbohydrate sources, producing a slower rate of increase in postprandial glucose levels and extending the duration of carbohydrate availability during exercise (102340).\nLipid effects\nAnimal research shows that tart cherry might improve lipid levels. Feeding tart cherry to rats with hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance for 90 days decreases fasting plasma glucose, lipid, and insulin levels and reduces fatty liver. These effects may be due to enhancement of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha activity by tart cherry (93185).\nMemory effects\nClinical research in healthy adults over 65 years of age with normal cognitive function shows that taking 1 cup of Montmorency tartcherry juice twice daily for 12 weeks increases subjective contentment with memory scores, and increases scores on a paired associates learning task, when compared with placebo (102140).\nMetabolic effects\nAnimal research shows that tart cherry might slow the development of metabolic syndrome through anti-inflammatory effects. In a rat model of obesity and metabolic syndrome, supplementing the diet with tart cherry powder containing 1% anthocyanins decreased lipids, fat mass, abdominal fat, and inflammatory mediators compared to a calorie-matched control (93194).\nPhotoprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that tart cherry seed extract might have photoprotective effects, possibly due to inhibition of UV-B mediated skin damage by oils in the seeds (93163).\nSleep effects\nTart cherry fruit contains melatonin, which might improve insomnia. Also, anti-inflammatory properties of tart cherry could influence pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in sleep regulation (17199).\nWeight loss effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that consuming muffins enriched with 20% to 30% tart cherry pulp improves satiety and reduces energy intake when compared to control in healthy females (93148). However, the long-term effects of tart cherry on body weight and hunger in overweight or obese people is unknown."

Alpha hydroxy acids are natural acids found in foods, including, but not limited to, citrus fruits, sugarcane, sour milk, apples, and grapes (6064, 10104, 95601). Tartaric acid is the main organic acid in grapes, raisins, and wine. It is also found in tamarind (108163, 108164, 108167). Potassium bitartrate, the potassium salt of tartaric acid, is sometimes found as an active ingredient in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription products; these products are not within the scope of this topic.",

It is unclear if inhaled tartaric acid is beneficial for asthma.\nPreliminary clinical research in asymptomatic and medicated patients with asthma shows that using two inhalations of tartaric acid 20% in sodium chloride to stimulate cough modestly improves pulmonary function five minutes later, based on the peak expiration, when compared with baseline. There were no changes in other pulmonary function tests (108166).\nless\nSwallowing dysfunction. It is unclear if inhaled tartaric acid is beneficial for preventing silent aspiration in patients with swallowing dysfunction.\nAn observational study in patients susceptible to silent aspiration related to dysphagia suggests that the stimulation of cough using inhalation of tartaric acid 10% was able to induce reflexive cough in about 90% of patients and the expectoration of aspirated food in approximately 71% of patients (108165). The validity of this finding is limited by the observational nature of the study and the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate tartaric acid for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTartaric acid is an alpha hydroxy acid. Alpha hydroxy acids are a group of natural acids found in foods (6064, 10104). Tartaric acid is found in levels of 1.5 to 4 grams/L in wine. Tartaric acid constitutes up to 1% of whole fresh grapes and is also found in tamarind (108163, 108164, 108167). Tartaric acid is also found in low levels in other fruits, such as bananas (108164).\nCholesterol effects\nUrinary tartaric acid levels, a marker of recent tartaric acid intake, are inversely associated with levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (108163).\nGastrointestinal effects\nTartaric acid may be used as a fuel source by colonic bacteria in the production of short chain fatty acids. In human research, use of cream of tartar as a source of tartaric acid decreases intestinal transit time but does not seem to affect the production of short chain fatty acids or levels of fecal bile acids (108167).\nHepatic effects\nIn an animal model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), tartaric acid reduces hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, partly by inhibiting pathways associated with fatty acid synthesis, inflammation, and lipid metabolism (116949).\nHormonal effects\nIn an animal model of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), tartaric acid improves serum levels of reproductive hormones (e.g., estradiol, luteinizing hormone, progesterone, testosterone) and the number of ovarian follicles (116948).\nRespiratory effects\nWhen inhaled, tartaric acid induces coughing. This is thought to be beneficial in patients with swallowing dysfunction and asthma (108165, 108166)."

            "Overview": "Taurine is often referred to as a non-essential amino acid, but it is actually an amino sulfonic acid. It is present in normal diets, with the highest levels found in meat, seafood, and eggs (3467, 77089, 77210, 101473, 101474). Taurine can also be synthesized through oxidation and decarboxylation of cysteine in the liver. Amounts supplied by a typical Western diet range from 40-400 mg daily (5280, 101471, 101473). Taurine is also a common ingredient in energy drinks (101471).",

Typical daily intakes for adults range from 40-400 mg (101471).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts. Taurine 2-4 grams daily in two or three divided doses has been used safely in studies lasting up to 3 months (5248, 5271, 8217, 8221, 10454, 77147, 95612, 98337, 104165, 104167). Higher doses of taurine 6 grams daily have been used safely in studies lasting up to 4 weeks (98336, 98337).

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, taurine is generally well-tolerated when used in typical doses for up to one year.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Constipation, diarrhea, and dyspepsia.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Hypersensitivity reactions in sensitive individuals. Case reports raise concerns for serious cardiovascular adverse effects, but these reports have involved energy drinks containing taurine and other ingredients. It is unclear if these adverse effects are due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nCardiovascular\nChanges in heart rate and increased blood pressure have been reported following the co-administration of taurine and caffeine, although the effects of taurine alone are unclear (77088). In healthy individuals, consumption of energy drinks containing taurine increased platelet aggregation and decreased endothelial function (77151, 112268, 112741). A case of cardiac arrest following strenuous exercise and an excessive intake of energy drinks containing caffeine and taurine has been reported (77136). In another case report, a 28-year-old male without cardiovascular risk factors presented to the hospital with radiating chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis after excessive intake of an energy drink containing taurine, caffeine, sugar, and glucuronolactone. Electrocardiogram findings confirmed myocardial infarction, and subsequent catheterization confirmed thrombotic occlusion (112741).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, taurine has been reported to cause hypoglycemia (77153).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, constipation has been reported following the administration of taurine (77231). Dyspepsia has also been reported after oral taurine use (104165).\nless\nHematologic\nIn clinical research, taurine reduced platelet aggregation (77245). A case of massive intravascular hemolysis, presenting with confusion, dark urine, dyspnea, emesis, and fever, has been reported following the administration of a naturopathic vitamin infusion containing taurine, free amino acids, magnesium, and a vitamin B and D complex (77177). However, the effects of taurine alone are unclear.\nless\nImmunologic\nA case report describes a hypersensitivity reaction in a female patient with a history of allergies to sulfonamides, sulfites, and various foods, after ingestion of taurine and other sulfur-containing supplements. The amount of taurine in the products ranged from 50-500 mg per dose. The allergic reaction recurred upon rechallenge with taurine 250-300 mg (91514).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nIn a case study, encephalopathy occurred in a body-builder who took approximately 14 grams of taurine in combination with insulin and anabolic steroids. It is not known if this was due to the taurine or the other drugs taken (15536).\n\nCases of seizures following the consumption of energy drinks containing taurine have been reported (77105, 77196). In clinical research, taurine has been reported to cause drowsiness and ataxia in epileptic children (77241).\nless\nPsychiatric\nIn a case report, a 36-year-old male with adequately controlled bipolar disorder was hospitalized with symptoms of mania after consuming several cans of an energy drink containing taurine, caffeine, glucuronolactone, B vitamins, and other ingredients (Red Bull Energy Drink) over a period of four days (14302). It is unknown if this effect was related to taurine.\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nIn human research, an exacerbation of pulmonary symptoms of cystic fibrosis has been associated with taurine supplementation, although this could also be caused by progression of the disease (77231).\nless\nRenal\nA case of acute kidney failure has been reported following the concomitant intake of 1 liter of vodka and 3 liters of an energy drink providing taurine 4.6 grams, caffeine 780 mg, and alcohol 380 grams (77185).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCongestive heart failure (CHF). Oral taurine may improve left ventricular function, heart failure-related symptoms, and exercise capacity in patients with CHF.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with heart failure shows that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams daily for up to 1 year modestly improves heart failure severity when compared with placebo (114794, 114796). However, the validity of this study limited by high heterogeneity. In individual studies, taking taurine 2-6 grams in two or three divided doses daily for 6-8 weeks seems to improve left ventricular function (5248, 5271, 8221) and symptoms of heart failure (5271, 5306, 8221) when compared with placebo or coenzyme Q10 in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV. Also, taking taurine 500 mg three times daily for 2 weeks seems to improve exercise capacity when compared with placebo in patients with heart failure (77176). Some patients with severe heart failure rapidly improve from NYHA class IV to II after 4-8 weeks of treatment. Improvement seems to continue for as long as taurine treatment is continued, up to one year (5306, 8217, 8218, 8221).\nless\nHepatitis. Oral taurine may improve liver function in patients with acute or chronic hepatitis.\nSeveral small clinical trials show that taking taurine 1.5-4 grams daily for up to 3 months improves liver function in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis when compared with placebo (10454, 77114, 77147).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nObesity. Oral taurine does not appear to improve body weight in adults who are obese or overweight.\nA meta-analysis of 12 small clinical trials shows that taurine supplementation does not reduce body weight or body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo. The studies included in this analysis evaluated taurine doses of 0.5-6 grams daily for 15 days to 6 months. Most of the patient populations evaluated in the included studies had liver or metabolic disorders; three studies specifically evaluated overweight or obese adults (104166). Additionally, a more recent clinical trial in a small group of females with obesity shows that taking taurine 1 gram three times daily along with a calorie-restricted diet for 8 weeks does not reduce body weight, BMI, or waist circumference when compared with calorie restriction alone (104167). In contrast, a very small study in adults with type 2 diabetes on antidiabetes medication shows that taking taurine 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces body mass, BMI, and body fat percentage when compared with control (112271). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcademic performance. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial to improve academic performance.\nA very small clinical study in college entrance examinees over age 19 shows that taking a jelly containing taurine 3 grams daily for 14 days does not improve academic achievement when compared with baseline or placebo (110579). Due to its small size, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for AMD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this purpose.\nAndrogenic alopecia. Oral taurine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with androgenic alopecia or telogen effluvium shows that taking a combination product containing taurine, cysteine, methionine, iron, selenium, and hydrolyzed collagen (GFM Oral, Cantabria Labs) along with conventional therapy, consisting primarily of finasteride or minoxidil, daily for 12 weeks improves hair loss when compared with conventional therapy alone (111636). It is unclear if this effect is due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAthletic performance. Research on the use of taurine for improving endurance or power output is limited and conflicting; however, it may improve performance by a small amount in some athletes.\nResearch is conflicting on the effects of taurine on athletic performance. Several clinical studies in trained and untrained athletes show that taking taurine 1-6 grams as a single dose before endurance exercise, or 3 grams daily for 8 weeks after endurance exercise, does not improve endurance or aerobic capacity when compared with placebo (77159, 77203, 95613, 98334).\n\nHowever, a meta-analysis of 7 small clinical trials shows that taking taurine 1-6 grams daily for up to 2 weeks slightly improves endurance when compared with control. Also, preliminary studies in male cyclists, recreationally active males, Olympic-level athletes, and female athletes habituated to caffeine show that taking taurine 50 mg/kg or 1-6 grams one time 1.5-2 hours prior to a cycling test increases the time to exhaustion and peak, mean, and minimum power output but does not improve perceived exertion, fatigue index, heart rate, or anaerobic capacity when compared with placebo (101475, 103211, 112265, 112269). The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear; the meta-analysis did not identify a dose or duration-related benefit. One small clinical trial shows that taking taurine 40 mg/kg improves muscle power in caffeine-deprived athletes who regularly use caffeine, but actually seems to worsen muscle power in athletes who do not regularly use caffeine (98335). Overall, it is not clear which population is most likely to benefit from taurine use (98337, 98338).\n\nStudy results are mixed when taurine has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One small study shows that taking a specific product containing taurine and caffeine (AdvoCare Spark) does not improve sprint performance in college athletes when compared with placebo (77195). However, other small studies of cyclists and boxers suggest that taking taurine in combination with a variety of other ingredients including B vitamins, caffeine, and glucuronolactone (Red Bull Energy Drink) or ginseng, kudzu, and soybean, may improve measures such as endurance, power, balance, or agility (37815, 57945, 110577, 112269). It is unclear if the benefits seen in these studies are due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this purpose.\nAutism spectrum disorder. Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for autism spectrum disorder, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this purpose.\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with CINV.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving 6 months of chemotherapy shows that taking taurine (pure powder, Aviforme) 1000 mg twice daily, starting 6 hours after receiving chemotherapeutic agents, significantly improves CINV in 87.5% of patients. Other symptoms, such as reduced appetite and smell and taste impairment, are also improved in some patients (91512).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for preventing or treating chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving 6 months of chemotherapy shows that taking taurine (pure powder, Aviforme) 1000 mg twice daily reduces plasma creatinine, urea, bilirubin, and liver enzymes after 4 months when compared with placebo. This suggests a protective effect against chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. A reduction in overall fatigue is also observed (95616).\nless\nCirrhosis. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with cirrhosis.\nOne small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with cirrhosis shows that taking taurine 1 gram three times daily for 4 weeks reduces the severity and frequency of muscle cramps when compared to baseline (104165). Another small clinical trial in patients with cirrhosis shows that taking taurine 6 grams daily for 4 weeks reduces portal hypertension by 12%, compared with a 2% increase in the placebo group (98336). However, it is unclear if this is associated with a reduced risk for complications such as variceal bleeding and ascites.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for improving cognitive function; however, taking an energy drink (Red Bull Energy Drink) containing taurine and other ingredients may modestly improve some measures of cognitive function.\nLevels of taurine decrease with age, but supplementation does not seem to have neuroprotective effects or cognitive benefits in the elderly (101471, 110574, 110578). In one small crossover study, taurine alone did not reduce errors in sleep-deprived individuals when compared with placebo (38154). However, taurine taken as part of an energy drink formulation containing taurine, caffeine, glucuronolactone, and B vitamins (Red Bull Energy Drink) improves focused and sustained attention, wakefulness, verbal reasoning, driving ability and quality, and reaction speed when compared with placebo (9899, 38117, 77088, 77202). Preliminary clinical research in young adults also shows that consuming the Red Bull Energy Drink might improve attention and verbal reasoning, but does not seem to improve memory, when compared with placebo (9899, 77088).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with critical illness.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials including adults in the intensive care unit (ICU) shows that receiving enteral nutrition enhanced with taurine for 5-14 days does not reduce mortality or shorten ICU length of stay when compared with control. Taurine was added to enteral nutrition at doses of 30-50 mg/kg or 10 mg total daily (114795). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nCystic fibrosis. Oral taurine may reduce steatorrhea in children with cystic fibrosis, but it does not seem to improve other measures of nutritional status.\nSome small clinical studies in children with cystic fibrosis show that taking taurine 30-40 mg/kg daily for 7 days to 6 months might be useful as adjunctive therapy to reduce steatorrhea when compared with baseline or placebo (10455, 77227, 77231). However, it does not seem to improve growth, lung function, muscle protein breakdown, or other symptoms of cystic fibrosis (77224 ,77228). Also, adding taurine 500-1500 mg daily to treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid for up to one year does not improve liver function tests, fat absorption, or nutritional status in patients with cystic fibrosis and associated liver disease when compared with ursodeoxycholic acid alone (77246, 77256).\nless\nDelirium. It is unclear if oral taurine prevents delirium in patients in the intensive care unit.\nA large clinical study of hospitalized adults in Iran who underwent liver transplantation shows that taking a specific taurine powder product (100% Taurine Amino Acid, MyProtein) 2 grams daily for 30 days post-transplant reduces the risk of delirium by 73% when compared with placebo. These results also suggest that for every four patients treated with taurine over placebo, one additional case of delirium is prevented. Patients who took taurine also had less time on the ventilator and shorter intensive care and hospital stays (110575). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to taurine or other factors since ventilator time and intensive care length of stay are risk factors for delirium.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nPlasma levels of taurine are reported to be lower in patients with diabetes than in healthy controls (101473). However, clinical research evaluating taurine for glycemic control is mixed (77074, 103212). One small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking taurine 1 gram three times daily for 8 weeks reduces blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (103212). Although there was no improvement in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), the study duration was not long enough to detect a meaningful reduction in HbA1c. Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking taurine 1-1.5 grams twice daily for 2-4 months does not affect fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, or insulin but may improve measures of insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo (77074, 112271). However, taking taurine while following an exercise program 3 times weekly does appear to reduce fasting blood sugar and HbA1c when compared with exercise plus placebo (112271). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear; however, all the included studies were small and potentially inadequately powered to detect a difference in outcomes.\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with diabetes and other metabolic disorders shows that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams orally daily for up to 1 year reduces fasting blood glucose by approximately 6 mg/mL, when compared with placebo (114796). However, many of the studies included patients who did not have diabetes. The validity of this study is also limited by high heterogeneity.\nless\nEpilepsy. Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this condition.\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with erectile dysfunction.\nAn open-label clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Icarifil, Anvest Health S.p.A) containing taurine 50 mg, panax ginseng , L-carnitine, L-citrulline, tribulus, and other ingredients orally daily for 3 months improves patient-reported erectile function when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking the supplement with tadalafil improves some, but not all, patient-reported assessments of erectile function when compared with taking tadalafil alone (114989). It is unclear if this effect is due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Small clinical studies suggest that oral taurine may modestly improve exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nOne small clinical trial in healthy, untrained adults shows that taking taurine 2 grams in combination with branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) three times daily for 2 weeks reduces subjective muscle soreness by 37% when compared with placebo (77212). Another small clinical trial in young, untrained males shows that taking taurine (Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., LTD.) 2 grams three times daily after meals before exercise, and continuing for three days after exercise, reduces delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), but not creatine kinase levels, when compared with placebo (91513).\nless\nFatigue. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for improving fatigue.\nOne small clinical trial shows that taurine seems to reduce fatigue when taken alone, but increases fatigue when taken in combination with caffeine (77202). However, an observational study in young adults has found that subjective scores for physical and mental fatigue do not seem to correlate with dietary taurine intake (101472). One small clinical trial shows that drinking 500 mL of an energy drink providing taurine 1 gram plus other ingredients including caffeine and B vitamins decreases measures of driving-related fatigue in a driving simulation when compared with placebo (91075).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral taurine can aid in the eradication of helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).\nOne clinical trial shows that taking taurine 500 mg twice daily in combination with conventional treatment for 6 weeks increases H. pylori eradication and shortens duodenal ulcer scarring time in patients with confirmed H. pylori infection when compared with conventional treatment alone (77145).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for lowering lipid levels.\nA meta-analysis of 12 small clinical trials in adults with various liver or metabolic disorders, but without a specific diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, shows that taurine supplementation reduces total cholesterol by 11 mg/dL and triglycerides by 13 mg/dL, but does not seem to improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo. The studies included in this analysis evaluated doses of 0.5-6 grams daily for 15 days to 6 months (104166). Another meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with various cardiovascular and metabolic disorders shows that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams orally daily for up to 1 year reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by approximately 18 mg/dL and 6 mg/dL, respectively, when compared with placebo. Taking taurine did not affect high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (114796). However, many of the studies included patients who did not have hyperlipidemia. The validity of this study is also limited by high heterogeneity. The benefits of taurine in adults with hyperlipidemia are unclear.\n\nThe effect of taurine has also been investigated in combination with exercise. A very small study in adults with type 2 diabetes on antidiabetes medication shows that taking taurine 500 mg twice daily while participating in an exercise program 3 times weekly for 8 weeks reduces triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol when compared with exercise plus placebo (112271).\nless\nHypertension. Oral taurine may modestly reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension; however, the long-term antihypertensive effects of taurine are unclear.\nOne clinical study in patients with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension shows that taking taurine 1.6 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 3 mmHg when compared with placebo. The benefit is seen after 8 weeks of continued supplementation (95614). A small clinical trial in patients with stage 2 hypertension (previously classified as borderline hypertension) shows that taking taurine 6 grams daily for 7 days reduces both SBP and DBP when compared to baseline (77229). The long-term effects of taurine on blood pressure are unclear.\n\nA meta-analysis of 12 small clinical trials in adults with various liver or metabolic disorders, but without a specific hypertension diagnosis, shows that taurine supplementation reduces SBP by 5 mmHg and DBP by 3 mmHg when compared with placebo. The studies included in this analysis evaluated doses of 0.5-6 grams daily for 15 days to 6 months (104166). Two meta-analyses of clinical trials in patients with cardiovascular and other metabolic disorders show that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams orally daily for up to 1 year reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 4 mmHg and 2 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo (114794, 114796). However, many of the studies included patients who did not have hypertension. The validity of this study is also limited by high heterogeneity.\n\nTaurine is commonly found in energy drinks, and its effect on blood pressure when used in combination with other ingredients in the form of an energy drink has been evaluated. A small observational study in young adults suggests that drinking a specific combination product containing taurine 100 mg, caffeine, and group B vitamins (Redbull Energy Drink) reduces heart rate but does not change SBP or DBP when compared to baseline (112266). However, another small observational study in young healthy adults suggests that drinking a specific combination product containing taurine 2000 mg, caffeine, ginseng, glucuronolactone, inositol, guarana, L-carnitine, and B vitamins (Monster Energy Drink) increases both SBP and DBP by about 16 mmHg and raises heart rate by 17 beats per minute 15 minutes after consumption when compared to baseline. However, 90 minutes after consumption only DBP and heart rate remain elevated (112268). In both studies, the validity of the effects is limited by a lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nInfant development. Higher maternal intake of taurine from the diet may be linked to increased newborn length and weight; however, feeding taurine-containing formula to newborns does not appear to improve infant development.\nOne observational study has found a positive correlation between maternal dietary taurine intake and newborn length. In pregnant patients with high taurine intake (>120 mg/day), neonatal birth weight and length were significantly higher when compared with groups with lower taurine intake (101474). However, clinical research shows that administering infant formula containing taurine 45 mg/L for up to 12 weeks does not affect weight, length, head circumference, or behavior in preterm and full-term infants when compared with formula without taurine (77119, 77216, 77218, 77239, 77260).\nless\nIron deficiency anemia. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with iron deficiency anemia.\nOne small clinical trial in females with iron deficiency anemia shows that taking taurine 1000 mg plus ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily for 20 weeks improves hemoglobin concentrations, red blood cell counts, and serum ferritin levels when compared with ferrous sulfate plus placebo (77070).\nless\nMuscular dystrophy. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with muscular dystrophy.\nOne very small crossover trial in patients with muscular dystrophy shows that taking taurine 100-150 mg/kg for 6 months improves the ability to relax muscles after voluntary use when compared with placebo (77235).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral taurine improves physical performance in older adults.\nA small study in elderly females living in a care facility shows that taking taurine powder 1.5 grams daily for 14 weeks in addition to standardized exercise training may modestly improve some measures of physical fitness (i.e. agility, endurance) when compared to baseline. These measures were not improved in patients who took taurine but did not participate in exercise training or who participated in exercise training but did not take taurine (110574). The validity of these findings is limited by lack of randomization, blinding, and statistical comparison between groups.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for improving postoperative recovery.\nOne small clinical trial in patients recovering from surgery after a hip fracture shows that taking taurine 6 grams daily for 7 days after surgery does not improve morbidity and mortality outcomes after 1 year when compared with placebo (95615).\nless\nPsychosis. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with psychosis.\nOne small clinical trial in adults up to 25 years of age with first-episode psychosis shows that taking taurine 4 grams daily for 12 weeks in combination with prescribed antipsychotics reduces positive psychotic symptoms, but not negative or cognitive symptoms, when compared with placebo (95612).\nless\nSleep deprivation. Oral taurine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination product containing taurine, caffeine, glucuronolactone, and B vitamins (Red Bull Energy Drink) reduces lane drifting and sleepiness and improves driving quality and reaction time during a car-driving simulator exercise in sleep-deprived individuals when compared with placebo (38117, 77066). Other preliminary clinical research in sleep-deprived surgical trainees shows that taking taurine 2 grams in addition to caffeine 150 mg improves reaction time during performance of simulated laparoscopic surgery when compared with placebo, although error-making is not reduced (38154).\nless\nTourette syndrome. Oral taurine may improve tic severity in children with Tourette syndrome who are taking tiapride at a dose of 300 mg or less. Taurine may not be effective in children taking higher doses of tiapride.\nOne clinical trial in children 6-16 years of age with Tourette syndrome or other tic disorders shows that taking taurine along with tiapride reduces the severity of tics when compared with tiapride alone. For every 6 children taking taurine, one additional child saw a 60% or greater reduction in tic severity as measured on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale when compared with placebo. However, taurine did not improve tic severity in children taking tiapride at a dose greater than 300 mg daily (103210). Taurine was taken in age-dependent doses of 2.4 grams daily in those 6-8 years, 3.6 grams daily in those 9-13 years, and 4.8 grams daily in those 14-16 years.\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with a TBI.\nA small clinical study of adults in Iran receiving treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) following TBI shows that adding a specific taurine powder product (Nutricost) 30 mg/kg/day up to 3 grams daily to enteral nutrition for 14 days may modestly improve disease severity scores, but does not reduce days on the ventilator, ICU length of stay, or mortality at 30 days when compared with usual enteral nutrition (110573). Due to its small size, this study may have been underpowered to detect differences between groups.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate taurine for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nTaurine has most often been used in doses of 1.5-6 grams daily, taken in divided doses. The duration of therapy depends on the condition being treated. Doses of up to 6 grams daily have been used for up to one year. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nConcomitant use of taurine supplements or taurine-containing energy drinks with alcohol should be avoided if possible. Some research suggests that consuming taurine might increase alcohol consumption, potentially increasing the risk for alcohol poisoning (101471).\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nEnergy drinks typically contain taurine 750-1000 mg per serving (101471).\n\nPediatric amino acid formulations such as Aminosyn-PF and Trophamine contain taurine 70 mg/100mL and 25 mg/100mL respectively (77083).",

            "Interactions with Conditions": "None known.",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with taurine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn vitro research suggests that taurine uptake is mediated by both PAT1 (SLC36A1) and TauT (SLC6A6) transport mechanisms. TauT uptake may predominate during periods of low taurine concentrations (such as seen between meals), and PAT1 uptake seems to predominate during periods of high taurine concentrations (such as during meals) (77135).\nDistribution\nAnimal research suggests that taurine distributes rapidly into the liver and kidneys, but only in low amounts to the brain and muscle (77059). Taurine is found in human platelets (8219, 77075).\nExcretion\nTaurine is conjugated to bile acids (77230, 77246). It is also excreted in the urine, with higher urinary levels found after red meat consumption (77181). Urinary taurine excretion is decreased in people with calcium oxalate or phosphate-containing renal calculi (77149).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTaurine is a non-essential amino acid also known as 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. It is found in high levels in protein-rich foods, such as meat, fish, and eggs, as well as in breast milk. Taurine is normally synthesized in the human body in adequate amounts by oxidation and decarboxylation of cysteine (5280, 101473). Taurine is important in several metabolic processes in the body, including stabilizing cell membranes in electrically active tissues, such as the brain and heart, and supporting proliferation of neural progenitor cells and synapse formation in the brain. It is found in high concentrations in the developing brain, and also in the adult hippocampus, cerebellum, and hypothalamus (101471). Taurine also has functions in the gallbladder, eyes, and blood vessels, and may have some antioxidant and detoxifying properties. Taurine is also a vasorelaxant in the retina (77106).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nTaurine has been shown to ameliorate inflammation in vitro and in vivo (77090, 103213). In cellular research, taurine inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 (77155). A similar reduction in IL-6 has been seen clinically (77187), although conflicting research exists (103209, 110576). In humans, taurine down-regulates inflammatory mediators, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and malondialdehyde (MDA), protecting and regenerating damaged tissue (77099, 103209, 110576). However, research related to the effect of taurine on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha has mixed results (103209, 110576).\nAntiallergy effects\nIn a mouse model of allergic rhinitis, taurine ameliorated the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis, likely through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (103213).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animal research, intraperitoneal administration of taurine dose-dependently attenuated streptozotocin-induced elevations in blood glucose (77162). In humans, plasma taurine levels have been found to be lower in people with type 2 diabetes than in controls, and they are lowest in those with type 2 diabetes who also have neuropathy (101473). Taurine is thought to act on beta cell secretion and to interfere with insulin signaling pathways. In animals it improves glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia (101473).\nAntiemetic effects\nThe inhibitory effect of taurine on nausea and vomiting may result from its neuroprotective or inhibitory neurotransmitter actions. At the presynaptic site, taurine may inhibit voltage gated calcium channels and/or open the chloride channels and suppress the release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate. It may also increase K+ efflux to decrease the postsynaptic depolarization. Taurine may also act as an inhibitory neurotransmitter to lead to a reduction of nausea and vomiting (91512). Taurine displays inhibitory activity in the olfactory bulb by decreasing excitability and modulating release of GABA. GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in taste buds, and taurine acts as an agonist for GABA receptors. Therefore, taurine may play a role in decreasing taste sensation and improving hypergeusia. Taurine may also help reduce bitter tastes (91512).\nAntiepileptic effects\nPossible mechanisms for an antiepileptic effect of taurine include modulation of calcium homeostasis (77060, 77261), prevention of glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity (77171), establishing equilibrium between inhibitory and excitatory brain processes (77144), or activating GABA-A receptors (77063, 77072, 77219). The results of preliminary studies using taurine in humans with epilepsy are mixed, which could be due to variable penetration of taurine into the brain (77059, 77232, 77240, 77243, 77252).\nAntihypertensive effects\nAn inverse correlation between plasma taurine levels and systolic blood pressure has been reported (101473). Taurine inhibits sympathetic nervous system activity, dilates blood vessels, and suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (77229, 101473). In laboratory studies, taurine significantly upregulates expression of cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase in human mesenteric arteries. This increases production of hydrogen sulfide, resulting in vascular relaxation via inhibition of calcium influx (95614).\nAntineoplastic effect\nIn cellular research, taurine inhibited doxorubicin efflux from M5076 tumor cells and decreased the weight of tumors by 40% compared to doxorubicin alone (77148).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn preliminary research in vitro, taurine has demonstrated both direct and indirect antioxidant activity, via the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and the stabilization of membrane permeability, respectively (77112, 77118). In cancer cells, taurine has been shown to scavenge oxidant and cytotoxic agents, thus protecting against carcinogenesis (77191). Various clinical studies also suggest that taurine has antioxidant effects (77107, 77192, 103209). In one observational study, plasma taurine levels have been linked to improvements in oxidative stress makers in people taking hypolipidemic agents, possibly due to reduced superoxide anion production at the respiratory chain level (77192). In another human study, lipoperoxidation following coronary artery bypass grafting was reduced by taurine, indicating that it may be a free-radical scavenger (77107). In patients with type 2 diabetes, taurine 1000 mg three times daily for 8 weeks increased the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase when compared with placebo (103209).\nAntitoxin effects\nIn preclinical research, taurine prevents methamphetamine-induced developmental angiogenesis defects, possibly due to its antioxidant effects (77198). Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytoprotective, osmoregulatory, and membrane stabilizing effects of taurine may contribute to its protective effects against toxicity of drugs and other compounds (77205).\nAntiulcer effects\nIn individuals with Helicobacter pylori-induced duodenal ulcers, adjunct taurine (Dibicor) contributes to eradication of H. pylori, shortening of duodenal scarring time, improvement in KI-67, BCL-2 expression, and stimulation of apoptotic activity of epitheliocytes compared with conventional omeprazole and antibiotic treatment alone (77145).\nAthletic performance enhancement effects\nSome evidence from animal research suggests that the quantity of taurine in the muscle tissue may impact exercise performance. The mechanism for this activity may involve reduction of oxidative stress, increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the muscle interstitial space, and the stabilization and hyperexcitement of the cell membrane. Additional research suggests that taurine may influence the amount of energy provided by the glycolytic pathway during high-intensity exercise, reducing blood lactate accumulation during exercise and improving anaerobic capacity (95613).\nBiliary effects\nTaurine seems to stimulate bile acid synthesis (3467).\nCardiovascular effects\nTaurine has been explored as a potential preventative factor for various cardiovascular conditions (3467), including coronary heart disease (77146, 77169), cardiac remodeling (77150), and ischemic disease (77111, 77128), due in part to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, bile acid-conjugating, blood pressure-regulating, and intracellular calcium-modulating activities. Taurine might also lower blood pressure and might normalize excessive sympathetic nervous system activity that often occurs in people with hypertension and heart failure (3467, 8219, 8221, 8222). It also has an inotropic effect on cardiac myocytes and increases stroke volume (101475). Additionally, taurine seems to modestly lower the heart rate in patients with cardiovascular or other metabolic disorders (114794). Decreased and increased heart rate and increased blood pressure have been reported following the co-administration of taurine and caffeine in human research (77088, 112268).\n\nThe concentration of taurine increases in the left ventricle of patients with CHF (9900). Preliminary studies also suggest taurine might have natriuretic and diuretic activity (3467). Despite evidence of taurine's possible cardioprotective effects, some conflicting evidence exists. One observational study in patients suffering from cardiac arrest has found that patients with serum taurine levels in the upper quartile have around 4-fold higher odds of in-hospital mortality when compared with patients with taurine levels in the lower three quartiles (103208). Another study in young healthy adults suggests that taurine taken as part of an energy drink impairs endothelial cell function, decreases velocities of carotid arteries, and reduces cardiac output but does not seem to impact electrocardiogram parameters (112268).\n\nIn an animal model, heart perfusion with higher doses of taurine shortens cardiac repolarization, QT interval, and ventricular effective refractory periods, facilitating re-entry and leading to an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Researchers theorize that this mechanism may give insight into fatal outcomes secondary to intoxication with energy drinks reported in humans (112267).\nEffects in traumatic brain injury (TBI)\nTaurine levels increase in the brain in response to stress and it is released from swollen cells as normal volumes are re-established in people with TBI. Taurine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with TBI almost double, then return to baseline within 3 days (101471).\nGABA modulating effects\nTaurine stimulates action potentials in GABAergic neurons, specifically targeting GABA-A receptors (101471). It has been suggested that effects of taurine on GABA receptors may contribute to seizures occurring after consumption of taurine-containing energy drinks. Taurine may decrease expression of beta 2/3 subunits of GABA receptors, lowering the seizure threshold (77196).\nHormonal effects\nIn preliminary human research, a supplement containing taurine and other ingredients taken before exercise increased the post-exercise serum concentration of growth hormone (46700, 77122).\nHypersensitivity\nTaurine can be metabolized to sulfites, acetaldehyde, and aminoacetaldehyde which may cause hypersensitivity-type reactions (91514).\nLipid metabolism effects\nIn healthy people, taurine seems to reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, but increases very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol (77061, 77114, 77258). Studies have shown both increases and decreases in serum triglycerides (77076, 77114, 77258). These effects may be mediated by an effect of taurine on lipoprotein lipase. In people with liver injury, taurine decreases total cholesterol and triglycerides (77114).\nMuscle effects\nTaurine has been reported to decrease oxidative stress. It is possible that it prevents increases in carbonyl protein and lipoperoxide levels which contribute to muscle soreness (91513).\nThermoregulatory effects\nIn tests where cycling in a hot environment (35°C, 40% relative humidity) is continued to exhaustion, taurine slows the rise in core temperature and increases sweating rate at the end of the test by about 13%. Its vasodilatory effects may be contributing to heat dissipation, and it also seems to have central effects. It acts as an agonist at GABA-A receptors in the hypothalamus, affecting thermoregulation (101475)."

Tea tree oil became commercially available in the 1930s, primarily for topical use for skin conditions (77280, 109947). Tea tree oil is obtained by steam distillation of tea tree leaves. Tea tree oil has the aroma of nutmeg (515).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used topically and appropriately for up to 12 weeks (1538, 4028, 4031, 4445, 7032, 8573, 19157, 19158, 19159, 19163)(19318, 109944, 109945, 113000).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when used orally.

It can take up to a week for symptoms to resolve (10011).\n\nTopically, tea tree oil is usually well tolerated. However, it can cause local irritation and inflammation in some patients. Treatment with topical corticosteroids may be needed in some cases (10033, 13713, 19176, 91442, 91443, 109946, 109947). Severe allergic contact dermatitis has also been reported (109947, 109948, 112999). Tea tree oil can cause skin dryness, and less frequently pruritus, stinging, burning, and redness in patients with acne (8573, 91447, 109947). It may also cause mild oral mucosal burning (4445).\nless\nEndocrine\nIn one case, a prepubertal male who used a hair styling gel and shampoo product containing both tea tree oil and lavender oil developed gynecomastia. The gynecomastia resolved when the products were discontinued. It is possible that this effect was due to lavender oil, which has been associated with other cases of gynecomastia in prepubertal males (15254).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, tea tree oil can cause eucalyptus-like odor on the breath. In young children, ingestion of 10 mL or less of tea tree oil can cause this effect (4030, 10010, 11799).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, as little as 2.5 mL of tea tree oil can cause neutrophil leukocytosis.

There is preliminary evidence from animal research that preparations of pure tea tree oil can cause ototoxicity and impaired hearing. However, so far there are no reports of ototoxicity in humans. Until more is known, tell patients to avoid pure or highly concentrated tea tree oil preparations. Concentrations of 2% seem less likely to have this effect (7025).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOrally, tea tree oil can cause dyspnea and pneumonitis (109947).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAcne. Some clinical research shows that topical tea tree oil seems to improve symptoms of acne in adults and adolescents.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that applying a tea tree oil 5% gel is as effective as benzoyl peroxide 5% (Oxy-5, Benzac AC, and others) and more effective than placebo for treating acne. Tea tree oil might work more slowly than benzoyl peroxide, but it seems to be less irritating to facial skin (8573). Other clinical research shows that applying a tea tree oil 5% gel for 20 minutes twice daily for 45 days decreases acne lesions 3.6-fold, acne severity 5.7-fold, and comedone numbers, pustules, and papules when compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate acne (19176). Another small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate acne shows that applying a topical tea tree oil nanoemulsion with adapalene gel 0.1% once daily for 12 weeks reduces acne lesions and improves acne severity scores when compared with adapelene gel alone. However, the tea tree oil product was associated with an increased occurrence of mild adverse effects (109945). Conversely, a small clinical trial shows that applying tea tree oil 5% cream twice daily for 8 weeks reduces inflammatory acne lesions by 38%, compared with a 65% reduction in patients using a product based on Lactobacillus-fermented Chamaecyparis obtuse 5% cream. Additionally, the time of onset was slower with tea tree oil (91447).\nless\nOnychomycosis. Some clinical research suggests that topical pure tea tree oil seems to be beneficial for onychomycosis. It is unclear if the diluted oil is beneficial.\nTopical application of pure tea tree oil twice daily for 6 months can produce a mycological cure in about 18% of patients with toenail infections. It can also improve nail appearance and symptoms in about 56% of patients after three months and 60% of patients after 6 months of treatment. It seems to be comparable to twice daily application of clotrimazole 1% solution (1538). However, preliminary clinical research shows that lower concentrations of tea tree oil do not seem to be as effective. For example, there is some evidence that a tea tree oil 5% cream applied three times daily for 2 months has no beneficial effect (7032).\nless\nTinea pedis. Some clinical research suggests that topical tea tree oil 25% or 50% seems to be beneficial for tinea pedis, although it does not seem to work as well as standard treatments.\nTopical application of tea tree oil 25% or 50% solution twice daily appears to produce both clinical improvement and a mycological cure in 48% to 50% of patients after 4 weeks of treatment, compared with 13% of those using placebo (10033). However, tea tree oil 25% or 50% concentrations don't appear to be as effective for mycological cure as clotrimazole or terbinafine (13713). Also, although topical application of a tea tree oil 10% cream seems comparable to tolnaftate 1% cream for relieving symptoms of tinea pedis, including scaling, inflammation, itching, and burning, the tea tree oil cream appears no more effective than placebo in producing a mycological cure (4031).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBacterial vaginosis. Although there is interest in using intravaginal tea tree oil for bacterial vaginosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this condition.\nBlepharitis. Topical tea tree oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with seborrheic blepharitis shows that using a specific topical swab (TTO Thermal Swab, Jeomed Medicine and Health Production Company) containing tea tree oil and chamomile twice daily for 8 weeks improves blepharitis symptom scores, such as burning, itching, and dry eyes, when compared with using baby shampoo. Symptom improvements were maintained 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation (109944). A small open-label clinical trial in adults with mild-to-moderate anterior blepharitis shows that applying an eye gel containing tea tree oil 2%, hyaluronic acid, and other ingredients (Blephamed eye gel, Saya Teb Mana Co, Tehran, Iran) to the eyelid and roots of the eyelashes twice daily for 2 weeks improves symptoms of eyelid debris, but not eyelid erythema or edema, when compared with standard treatment including topical erythromycin ointment and fluorometholone eye drops(113000). It is unclear if this effect is due to tea tree oil, hyaluronic acid, or the combination.\nless\nCheilitis. Although there is interest in using topical tea tree oil for cheilitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this purpose.\nContact dermatitis. Preliminary clinical research suggests that topical tea tree oil is beneficial for nickel-induced contact dermatitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that undiluted or diluted tea tree oil for 3-5 days may reduce the area and redness of acute contact dermatitis reactions in people with nickel hypersensitivity (16337, 19191). Other preliminary clinical research in individuals with nickel allergy shows that applying 60-120 mcL of tea tree oil 20% or 50% (Australian bodycare tea tree oil, Maxmedica AB) once, immediately prior to nickel exposure, reduces nickel-induced contact dermatitis by 41% when compared with no treatment (19191).\nless\nDandruff. It is unclear if topical tea tree oil is beneficial for dandruff in adults and adolescents.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that a tea tree oil 5% shampoo, used for three minutes daily prior to rinsing for 4 weeks, reduces the total area and severity of scalp lesions, as well as the severity of dandruff, itchiness, and greasiness, by 23% to 28% in patients aged 14 years and older. However, it does not improve scalp scaliness (19178).\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if brushing or rinsing with tea tree oil is beneficial for dental plaque; the available evidence is conflicting.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that brushing with a tea tree oil 2.5% gel twice daily for 8 weeks reduces papillary bleeding, but does not improve gingival health or plaque, in patients with plaque-induced gingivitis (19179). Other preliminary clinical research also shows that using tea tree oil mouthwash does not reduce plaque formation following a professional tooth cleaning (19180). However, a small preliminary clinical trial shows that using a mouthwash made from 3-4 drops of pure tea tree oil in water 2-3 times daily after brushing for 14 days is as effective as using a mouthwash containing chlorhexidine 0.12% twice daily for reducing plaque (105241).\n\nSome preliminary clinical research has also evaluated tea tree oil in combination with other ingredients. A combination of tea tree oil 1.5% and xylitol 10% (Tebodont) for 3 months reduces plaque formation on tooth surfaces when compared with pretreatment (19181). Other research shows that rinsing with 10 mL of a solution containing tea tree oil, clove, and holy basil 0.2% to 0.3% each, for 30 seconds twice daily for 21 days, reduces plaque formation by 64% when compared to baseline (91446). It is not clear if the effects in these studies are due to tea tree oil, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if topical tea tree oil is beneficial for improving symptoms of dry eye due to cataract surgery or meibomian gland dysfunction.\nClinical research in patients with dry eye due to cataract surgery also using artificial tears and topical steroid drops shows that eyelid scrubbing with eye shampoo containing an undisclosed amount of tea tree oil for one month improves symptoms of dry eye, such as sensitivity, pain, and blurred vision, and reduces demodex counts, when compared with using shampoo without tea tree oil. There was no benefit of the tea tree oil on visual acuity (101998).\n\nClinical research in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction shows that applying a tea tree oil 1% shampoo around the eye once daily for 3 months improves gland function scores and dry eye symptom scores when compared with Johnson's baby shampoo (109943).\nless\nFuruncles (boils). Although there is interest in using topical tea tree oil for boils, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this condition.\nGingivitis. It is unclear if brushing or rinsing with tea tree oil is beneficial for gingivitis; the available evidence is conflicting.\nA small preliminary clinical trial shows that using a mouthwash comprised of 3-4 drops of pure tea tree oil in water 2-3 times daily after brushing for 14 days is as effective as using a mouthwash containing chlorhexidine 0.12% twice daily for reducing plaque and bleeding and improving gum health (105241). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with severe gingivitis shows that brushing with a tea tree oil 2.5% gel twice daily for 8 weeks reduces papillary bleeding when compared with baseline. However, the gel does not appear to improve plaque or the severity of plaque-induced gingivitis (19179).\n\nCombination products containing tea tree oil have also been investigated. Preliminary clinical research shows that rinsing with a specific product containing a combination of tea tree oil 1.5% and xylitol 10% (Tebodont) for 3 months reduces gum inflammation by 26% to 32% when compared with pretreatment (19181). Also, clinical research shows that rinsing with 10 mL of a solution containing tea tree oil, clove, and holy basil 0.2% to 0.3% each, for 30 seconds twice daily for 21 days, reduces gum inflammation by 76% when compared to baseline (91446). It is not clear if the effects in these studies are due to tea tree oil, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nHalitosis. It is unclear if tea tree oil mouth rinses are beneficial for halitosis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with halitosis shows that using a specific tea tree oil mouth rinse (100% Organic Tea Tree Oil, Dessert Essence) 10 mL twice daily for 7 days moderately improves halitosis severity scores and reduces salivary levels of Solobacterium moorei when compared with placebo. The improvements were similar to using chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% mouth rinse (109941).\n\nTea tree oil has also been studied as a combination treatment. One small clinical study suggests that applying an essential oil solution containing tea tree, peppermint, and lemon oils 0.125% as part of a single three-minute oral cleaning reduces the level of bad breath in patients from an intensive care unit when compared with baseline or benzydamine hydrochloride. 15 mL of the solution was applied to cotton sponges used to clean the teeth, tongue, and oral cavity (19177). Similarly, a small clinical trial in adults shows that cleaning the teeth, oral mucosa and tongue with gauze soaked in solution containing a tea tree oil, lemon and peppermint essential oil blend in a 1:1:0.2 ratio diluted with distilled water to 0.5% twice daily for 7 days improves halitosis when compared with gauze soaked with saline solution (112957). It is unclear if this effect is due to the tea tree oil, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHemorrhoids. Topical tea tree oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in children with hemorrhoids shows that application of a specific gel (Proctoial, BSD Pharma) containing tea tree oil, hyaluronic acid, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) daily for 14 days decreases symptoms of hemorrhoids, such as anal pain, defecation pain, irritation, inflammation, visible bleeding, and itching, when compared with placebo (19318).\nless\nHerpes labialis (cold sores). It is unclear if topical tea tree oil is beneficial for herpes labialis.\nOne small clinical study in adults with cold sores shows that applying a tea tree oil 6% gel five times daily does not improve the rate of cold sore resolution when compared with a placebo gel (2035). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nHirsutism. Topical tea tree oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild idiopathic hirsutism shows that using a spray containing lavender and tea tree oils twice daily for 3 months on specific hirsutism-affected areas decreases hair diameter by 8% to 9% and total hirsutism score by 11% when compared with baseline. The spray provides lavender oil 48 mcg and tea tree oil 2 mcg per square cm of skin. These improvements were not observed in a placebo group (91448).\nless\nInsect bite. Although there is interest in using topical tea tree oil for insect bites, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this purpose.\nLice. Topical tea tree oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nThere is preliminary evidence that tea tree oil repels lice and reduces blood feeding (19187). When used in combination with lavender oil, tea tree oil has ovicidal effects on head lice and reduces the number of live lice. A pediculicide containing tea tree oil 10% weight per volume and lavender oil 1% weight per volume (NeutraLice Natural Lotion, Key Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd) has been applied to the hair for 10 minutes, either as a single application or three times over 2 weeks, in children aged 4-12 years (19188, 19189). It is unclear if any effects are due to tea tree oil, lavender, or the combination.\nless\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It is unclear if topical tea tree oil is beneficial for the prevention of MRSA colonization or the treatment of MRSA infection.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that tea tree oil is not effective for preventing MRSA colonization. Using tea tree oil 5% body wash (Novabac 5% skin wash, Novasel Australia Pty Ltd.) is no more effective than a standard wash (Johnson's baby softwash, Johnson & Johnson) for preventing MRSA colonization in critically ill patients (91441).\n\nThere is contradictory evidence on the effects of tea tree oil for the treatment of MRSA infection. In patients with MRSA-colonized wounds, use of a 3% water-miscible solution of tea tree oil during the wound cleansing routine for each dressing change does not improve MRSA clearance (19190). Also, in patients with MRSA colonization, tea tree oil given in various preparations along with standard treatment for 5 days does not appear to increase overall MRSA clearance when compared with standard treatment alone. These various preparations, which contain tea tree oil 5% or 10%, include a cream applied to the nostrils three times daily, a body wash used at least once daily, or a cream applied to lesions, ulcers, wounds, and axillae or groin areas once daily. Although these various preparations do not improve overall clearance, it seems that using a tea tree cream and body wash may be more effective for eradicating MRSA from specific sites such as wounds and superficial skin infections when compared with standard treatments alone (19163). Also, preliminary clinical research suggests that using tea tree oil 4% nasal ointment plus tea tree oil 5% body wash increases MRSA clearance when compared with a triclosan body wash and mupirocin 2% nasal ointment (19158, 19159). Larger, high-quality studies are needed to confirm these results.\nless\nNipple fissures. It is unclear if topical tea tree oil improves nipple-related complications of breastfeeding, such as nipple fissures and pain.\nA small clinical study in breastfeeding adults in Turkey shows that applying either tea tree oil or coconut oil to the nipples immediately after breastfeeding on the 3rd, 7th and 10th day postpartum reduces the incidence of nipple fissures when compared with a control group receiving no treatment (113002).\nless\nOcular demodicosis. It is unclear if topical tea tree oil is beneficial for ocular demodicosis; available evidence is conflicting.\nSmall clinical studies suggest that tea tree oil can eradicate Demodex infestation in the eyelids and reduce associated symptoms such as corneal and conjunctival inflammation, ocular irritation, and vision loss. In adults, treatments have included weekly scrubs of the eyelid using tea tree oil 50% and daily scrubs of the eyelid with tea tree shampoo, as well as eyelid massages with tea tree ointment 5% to 10%, for up to 12 weeks (19182, 19183, 19184, 19185, 91445, 105243). In children aged 2.5-11 years, weekly scrubs of the eyelid using tea tree oil 50% and daily eyelid massages with tea tree oil 5% ointment for 4-6 weeks has been used (19184). However, conflicting evidence exists. One meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials shows that although patients using tea tree oil for 4-6 weeks were 68% more likely to have an eradication of mites, while another meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials shows that the use of tea tree oil products does not reduce the number of Demodex mites or reported symptoms. Also, a single study shows that receiving intense pulsed light over 12 weeks is more effective than tea tree oil. The certainty of evidence for these endpoints is very low and the majority of available research has an unclear or high risk of bias (105243).\nless\nOropharyngeal candidiasis. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with tea tree oil is beneficial for the prevention of oropharyngeal candidiasis in various populations.\nOne very small clinical study in adults with HIV/AIDS who are refractory to fluconazole shows that swishing and expelling tea tree oil solution 15 mL four times daily for 2-4 weeks seems to improve oral candidiasis when compared to baseline (4445). Another small clinical study in adults with terminal cancer shows that using tea tree oil, as part of an essential oil mixture containing geranium, peppermint, and lavender twice daily for one week improves subjective measures of oral comfort and objective measures of oral health status and reduces Candida albicans count when compared with saline solution (19192). However, in patients with dentures, adding 1 mL of tea tree oil to a standard 5 mL dose of Coe-Comfort tissue conditioner treatment for 12 days does not reduce inflammation or Candida albicans growth when compared with Coe-Comfort alone (19193).\nless\nOtitis externa. Although there is interest in using tea tree oil in the ear for otitis externa, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this condition.\nOtitis media. Although there is interest in using tea tree oil in the ear for otitis media, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this condition.\nPharyngitis. Although there is interest in gargling with tea tree oil for pharyngitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this purpose.\nRosacea. Topical tea tree oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate rosacea shows that applying permethrin 2.5% gel containing an undisclosed amount of tea tree oil to the affected area for one hour twice daily for 12 weeks reduces demodex mite counts by about 13% more than placebo. Furthermore, symptoms such as papules, burning, and redness were improved by moderate amounts when compared with placebo (101999). The effect of tea tree oil alone is unknown.\nless\nScabies. Although there is interest in using topical tea tree oil for scabies, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this condition.\nSeborrheic dermatitis. Although there is interest in using topical tea tree oil for seborrheic dermatitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this condition.\nTinea corporis. Although there is interest in using topical tea tree oil for tinea corporis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this condition.\nToothache. Although there is interest in rinsing the mouth with tea tree oil for toothache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this purpose.\nVaccine reaction. Topical tea tree oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical trial in adults shows that applying tea tree oil, in combination with inhaling aromatherapy with eucalyptus oil, immediately after a COVID-19 vaccination and every 2 waking hours over the next 48 hours reduces self-reported pain, swelling, and lump at the injection site, but not erythema, in the first 24 hours when compared with control. However, after 48 hours, only lump at the injection site was reduced compared to control (113141). It is unclear if these effects are due to tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, or the combination. Additionally, the interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of a placebo in the control group.\nless\nVaginal candidiasis. Although there is interest in using intravaginal tea tree oil for vaginal candidiasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this purpose.\nWater warts. It is unclear if topical tea tree oil is beneficial for water warts in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with a mean age of 6.3 years with water warts shows that a 4 mcL drop of an oil containing iodine plus Australian tea tree oil 75%, standardized to 40.1% terpinene-4-ol, applied twice daily for up to 30 days, increases lesion resolution when compared with tea tree oil or iodine alone (19194).\nless\nWound healing. Although there is interest in topical tea tree oil for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tea tree oil for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate tea tree oil for these uses.",

As little as 2.5 mL of tea tree oil can cause neutrophil leukocytosis. It can take up to a week for symptoms to resolve (10011). There is at least one case of coma following ingestion of 120 mL of tea tree oil (4028). In young children, ingestion of 10 mL or less of tea tree oil can cause significant ataxia, drowsiness, disorientation, coma, and respiratory failure (4030, 10010, 11799).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with tea tree oil.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available regarding the pharmacokinetics of tea tree oil.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTea tree oil is obtained by the distillation of the leaves of the tea tree. The oil contains more than 100 monoterpenoid, sesquiterpenoid, and alcohol compounds. Up to 90% consists of terpinen-4-ol, 1,8-cineole, alpha-terpineol, terpinolene, and alpha- and gamma-terpinene (4027, 7111).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEvidence suggests tea tree oil may reduce histamine-induced skin inflammation caused by invading organisms. Tea tree oil applied to histamine-induced inflammation of the skin can decreases mean weal volume (10009). In vitro data suggest terpinen-4-ol and tea tree oil can suppress production of superoxide, inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukins 1, 8 and 10, and prostaglandin E2 (16337, 77267, 77271). However, the tea tree oil constituents eucalyptol and limonene may be responsible for the adverse effect of contact eczema (10015, 10029).\nAnti-lice effects\nTea tree oil has been shown to be effective against lice in human research (19188, 19189). In animal research, topical tea tree oil 1% to 2% also acts as a lousicide against Bovicola ovis (91444).\nAnti-mite effects\nTea tree oil is thought to help stimulate embedded Demodex mites to migrate out of the skin for easier removal and may have direct antiparasitic properties. In addition, the antibacterial effects of tea tree oil might inhibit the bacterial activity of Demodex-associated bacteria (19182, 105243, 113000).\nAntibacterial effects\nThe primary constituent terpinen-4-ol is active against numerous pathogenic bacteria and fungi but seems to spare normal skin flora. The constituents, alpha-terpineol and linalool, may contribute to its antimicrobial activity (10012, 10026, 77296, 77302). Tea tree oil appears to disrupt the permeability barrier of microbial cell membrane structures, causing loss of chemiosmotic control (10028). Tea tree oil has in vitro activity against Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, including vancomycin-resistant strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae, including gentamicin-resistant strains, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4448, 4451, 7111, 10012, 10026).\n\nTea tree oil also has in vitro activity against both methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4448, 4451, 7111, 10014, 10027, 77285). The oil seems to have limited activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7111, 10012, 10026). Oils produced with increased concentrations of terpinen-4-ol seem to have greater activity against these organisms (7111).\n\nTea tree oil has also been found to be active against Propionibacterium acnes and Escherichia coli (8573) and Porphyromonas gingivalis and other oral microorganisms (48954, 77270).\nAntifungal effects\nTea tree oil is active against various pathogenic fungi in vitro. Tea tree oil has been found to inhibit growth of the yeast Candida albicans (4445, 4446, 10012, 19193). Tea tree oil has also been found to inhibit in vitro growth of the yeast species malassezia, which is commonly found on human skin (4450). It is also active against Aspergillus flavus, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, and Pityrosporum ovale (8573, 19178, 43472). Tea tree oil and its constituents terpinen-4-ol, gamma-terpinene, and 1,8-cineole, have antifungal effects against Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium culmorum, and Pyrenophora graminea (77291).\nAntiviral effects\nTea tree oil seems to have in vitro activity against herpes simplex virus (2035, 14389).\nDermatological effects\nThere is interest in using tea tree oil for aging skin. Preliminary clinical research in healthy young adults shows that application of tea tree essential oil 2% or tea tree essential oil nanoemulsion 2%, as 1 mL daily for 90 days, improves skin elasticity, but not hydration, when compared with placebo (109942).\nHormonal effects\nTea tree oil has modest estrogenic and antiandrogenic effects in vitro (15254)."

It is unclear if oral Terminalia arjuna is beneficial in patients with angina.\nLow-quality clinical research in patients with angina shows that taking Terminalia arjuna extract 500-2000 mg orally daily for 3 months reduces the frequency of angina symptoms by 50% to 71% when compared with baseline. These results were similar to taking conventional therapy (2502, 2503). Other preliminary research in adults with chronic stable angina shows that taking Terminalia arjuna 500 mg orally three times daily for 7 days reduces the need for rescue treatment and improves exercise tolerance when compared with placebo. Improvements were similar to taking isosorbide mononitrate 20 mg twice daily (92833).\nless\nAsthma. Although there has been interest in using oral Terminalia arjuna for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Terminalia arjuna for this purpose.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral Terminalia arjuna is beneficial for athletic performance.\nA small clinical study in young regular exercising males shows that taking Terminalia arjuna extract (Oxyjun, Enovate Biolife Pvt Ltd, India) 400 mg daily for 8 weeks increases the time to exhaustion by approximately 117 seconds when compared with placebo. There were also modest improvements in feelings of perceived exertion and the left ventricular ejection fraction, a measure of blood pumped from the heart with each heartbeat (111093). It is unclear if oral Terminalia arjuna is beneficial other populations such as athletes and females.\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral Terminalia arjuna is beneficial in patients with CHD.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with CHD shows that taking Terminalia arjuna bark powder 500 mg orally daily for 30 days decreases levels of total cholesterol by about 10% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 16% when compared with baseline. Taking Terminalia arjuna bark powder did not improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (92832).\nless\nHeart failure. The effects of Terminalia arjuna in patients with heart failure is unclear; evidence to date comes from small, short-term clinical studies, and results are conflicting.\nPreliminary, low-quality clinical research in patients with severe, refractory congestive heart failure shows that taking Terminalia arjuna bark extract 500 mg orally three times daily for 2 weeks, as an adjunct to conventional therapy, improves left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by 17% when compared with placebo (2504). However, other preliminary clinical research in adults with stage II heart failure shows that taking an extract of Terminalia arjuna bark 750 mg orally twice daily as an adjunct to conventional therapy for 12 weeks does not improve LVEF, functional class, or functional capacity when compared with placebo (96726). However, the validity of these trials is limited by short-term treatment and variation in the conventional therapies used to manage heart failure.\nless\nHyperlipidemia.

The bark contains several active constituents, including gallic acid, ethyl gallate, and the flavone luteolin (6).\nAnticancer effects\nTerminalia arjuna contains luteolin, which may have anticancer properties (2506).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe bark of Terminalia arjuna is reported to be beneficial in cardiovascular conditions; however, the exact mechanism is not known. Terminalia arjuna is reported to lower serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels (2505, 2517, 2519). It is also thought to have an antihypertensive effect and act as a cardiac stimulant. However, studies have been conflicting, with some indicating that it may actually increase blood pressure (33). In one study of patients with heart failure, Terminalia arjuna bark extract given daily for 12 weeks led to a larger reduction in red blood cell catalase activity than those receiving placebo; however, there was no change in red blood cell glutathione, red blood cell superoxide dismutase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), other markers of oxidative stress, or clinical function (96726). Terminalia arjuna has also been investigated in healthy overweight adults. In this population, Terminalia arjuna extract modestly improves left ventricular ejection fraction, indicative of improved heart activity (111012).\nDrug metabolism effects\nIn vitro research shows that Terminalia arjuna extract potently inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9 in human liver microsomes (96729). The exact mechanism of this effect is unclear. The constituents arjunic acid, arjunetin, and arjungenin did not exhibit inhibitory activity on any liver microsomes in vitro (96729).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nThere is interest in using Terminalia arjuna for osteoporosis. Animal research in ovariectomized rats shows that taking Terminalia arjuna bark methanolic extract 250-500 mg/kg daily for 40 days attenuates changes in serum calcium and phosphorous levels and bone mineral density when compared with control. An aqueous extract of Terminalia arjuna bark did not consistently improve these parameters (109678)."

Although the mechanism of action is not clear, research in an animal neuropathic pain model suggests that benefits may be related to reductions in brain oxidative stress and/or expression of nerve growth factor and nuclear factor-kappa B (111100).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nAnimal research in rats with chemically-induced diabetes shows that taking Terminalia chebula fruit extract 200-1000 mg/kg orally daily for 4-6 weeks improves fasting blood glucose by 22% to 47% when compared with control (109681, 111758). Terminalia chebula also moderately improved serum lipid parameters, but not body weight (109681, 111758). Research in an animal diabetic model suggests that Terminalia chebula also protects against pancreatic and liver damage and has modest antioxidant effects (111758). Other research in rats with chemically-induced diabetes shows that consuming a barley and/or wheat mixture with Terminalia chebula fruit, Terminalia bellirica fruit, and Indian gooseberry fruit extract for 60 days inhibits activity of intestinal alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) when compared with control (109680).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nTerminalia chebula fruit is used for osteoarthritis based on its potential anti-inflammatory effects. In vitro, the fruit extract inhibits the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase.

The binding affinity is slightly lower than that of the natural androgen dihydrotestosterone. It has a low affinity for the progesterone receptor (108158, 108162). In addition, the activity of testolone is greater in muscle and breast cancer cells, when compared with prostate cells (108158, 108162). In patients with breast cancer, levels of surrogate markers of androgen receptor activation, including prostate specific antigen and sex hormone binding globulin, were affected (108159).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro, testolone binds to the androgen receptor on endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells and reduces proliferation. In various animal breast cancer models, tumor growth is inhibited. The mechanism of action may be related to increased androgen receptor activity, as well as decreased expression and activity of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), with downregulation of many target genes (108158)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTetrahydrocannabivarin is a naturally-occurring cannabinoid that can also be derived from another cannabinoid, cannabidivarin. It is similar in structure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) but with a slightly longer lipophilic alkyl chain (101291). In vitro research shows that tetrahydrocannabivarin has some activity at human CB1 and CB2 receptors (107341, 107413). The nature of this activity seems to depend on which receptor is expressed, and these effects change qualitatively and quantitatively when the two receptors are expressed together (107413).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that tetrahydrocannabivarin reduces inflammation and inflammatory pain by activating cannabinoid CB2 receptors (101303). In vitro research also shows that tetrahydrocannabivarin has anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) production via CB2 and by inhibiting or mitigating signalling pathways involved in inflammation, resulting in reduced pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and cyclooxygenase-2 (101308, 115483).\nAnticonvulsant effects\nAnimal research shows that tetrahydrocannabivarin reduces experimentally induced seizures by modulating the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (101306).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using tetrahydrocannabivarin for reducing symptoms of nausea. Animal research suggests that tetrahydrocannabivarin has anti-nausea effects (101297). However, the exact mechanism of this effect is unknown.\nGenitourinary effects\nIn vitro research shows that tetrahydrocannabivarin decreases bladder contractions induced by acetylcholine but not those induced by electrical stimulation (101307).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in whether cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabivarin might benefit diabetes. Animal research shows that tetrahydrocannabivarin reduces glucose intolerance and increases insulin sensitivity in obese mice. The mechanism of these effects is unknown, but is thought to be linked to tetrahydrocannabivarin's CB1 neutral antagonism and modulation at CB2 (101311).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nThere is interest in using tetrahydrocannabivarin for preventing dyskinesia caused by the Parkinson disease medication levodopa. Research in mice with dopamine deficiency shows that administering tetrahydrocannabivarin intraperitoneally along with levodopa delays the onset and reduces the severity of dyskinesia when compared with using levodopa alone (104906).\nNeurologic effects\nThere is interest in using tetrahydrocannabivarin for its anti-psychotic effects for conditions like schizophrenia and also for reducing psychotic effects of medications. In vitro research shows that tetrahydrocannabivarin increases activation of the serotonin 1A receptor which suggests antipsychotic effects (101304). Tetrahydrocannabivarin also seems to reduce certain negative neurologic effects of synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Clinical research in healthy patients shows that taking tetrahydrocannabivarin 10 mg daily for 5 days reduces memory loss and other intoxicating effects of THC 1 mg given once intravenously (101305).\n\nThere is interest in tetrahydrocannabivarin for improving eating style in obesity by regulating reward and aversion in the brain. Clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that tetrahydrocannabivarin increases activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, putamen, and midbrain to pleasant stimuli. It also increases activation in the amygdala, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex to aversive stimuli (101310). Additional clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking tetrahydrocannabivarin 10 mg affects functional connectivity between the amygdala and cognitive control networks, which might affect control over food intake (101309). Ex vivo research in mouse autaptic hippocampal neurons shows that tetrahydrocannabivarin acts as a CB1 antagonist and can potently inhibit endogenous cannabinoid signaling through presynaptic inhibition (107342).\n\nAdditional animal research has demonstrated cataleptic, hypothermic, anti-nociceptive, hypolocomotive, and anxiolytic effects with tetrahydrocannabivarin (107341, 115783)."

Another small clinical trial in resistance trained males shows that taking theacrine (TeaCrine, Compound Solutions, Inc.) 300 mg alone or 150 mg in combination with caffeine 150 mg 90 minutes prior to exercise does not improve endurance or rowing time trial performance when compared with placebo (103274).\nless\nCognitive function. Oral theacrine has mostly been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking theacrine does not improve concentration or most other measures of cognitive function (88784, 99950, 99952). Studies have used single doses of 200-275 mg of a specific theacrine product (TeaCrine; Compound Solutions, Inc.) alone, in combination with caffeine 150 mg, or in a proprietary combination with caffeine 150 mg, white willow bark, SAMe, Rauwolfia vomitoria, vitamin B12, and citrus bioflavonoids (TheaTrim, Purus Labs).

Some research in animal models suggests that theacrine increases locomotor activity. However, responses may be dependent on dose or route of administration (88778, 88782). Like caffeine, theacrine may follow a bi-phasic dose-response curve, with low doses decreasing activity and high doses increasing activity (88782). The locomotor effects of theacrine relate to its activity at adenosine and dopamine receptors. Theacrine potentially acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist and increases dopamine levels (88782, 99951). Chronic exposure to theacrine does not appear to be associated with locomotor sensitization or tolerance (88782)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTheaflavin and its galloyl esters are flavonoids with a benzotropolone structure found in black tea, and to a lesser extent in oolong tea. Theaflavin, which is interchangeably called theaflavins, consists of theaflavin-3-gallate A, theaflavin-3'-gallate B, and theaflavin-3-3'-digallate (15664, 99648, 99649, 112773). These theaflavins are formed during the fermentation process that produces black tea from green tea leaves. They are oxidized forms of their parent catechins, which are epicatechin, epicatechin 3-gallate, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin 3-gallate, produced by the actions of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes (99648, 99650). Theaflavins are reddish-yellow pigments that are important for the color and taste of black tea (15656, 15657). Theaflavins comprise 10-30% of the total flavonoid content of black tea (99649, 99650).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro research suggests that theaflavin might have activity against liver and gastric cancer cells and leukemia cells (15657). Theaflavin seems to exert an antiproliferative effect on tumor cells by down-regulating epidermal growth factor, which regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation (15660). Other research on cancer cells suggests that theaflavins act as aromatase inhibitors and also act as HER2/neu tyrosine kinase inhibitors, suggesting a role in treating and preventing hormone-dependent breast cancer (15661). Theaflavin has also been shown to induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells (15662).\nAnti-diabetes effects\nIn animal diabetic models, theaflavin reduces fasting blood glucose, increases insulin levels, and improves insulin resistance and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, with an effect comparable to metformin (104617, 112773, 112774). A fermented green tea product containing theaflavin also appears to reduce blood glucose levels in healthy humans and in an animal model (99648). Possible mechanisms of action include inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, resulting in inhibited intestinal glucose production (15665). In addition, theaflavin seems to normalize levels of enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, which may be related to its antioxidant effects (104617).\n\nTheaflavin also protects against nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Long-term hyperglycemia and oxidative stress result in accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which damage the structure and function of the kidneys via inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis. Theaflavin inhibits formation of AGEs, and prevents inflammation and fibrosis by inhibiting the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) / nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B signaling pathway. Levels of inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1b, and IL-6), and fibrosis markers (transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-1, fibronectin, and type IV collagen) are reduced (112774).\nAnti-hyperlipidemic effects\nIn vitro, black tea polyphenols, including theaflavins, inhibit enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis (99649). They also reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride levels in obese animals (112773). Possible mechanisms include reduced intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increased fecal excretion of fat and cholesterol, reduced hepatic cholesterol accumulation, and up-regulation of LDL receptors in liver cells (11308).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal models of stroke, theaflavin seems to limit ischemia by inhibiting inflammatory processes including lipid peroxidation, leukocyte infiltration, and inflammation related genes such as ICAM-1 (15666).\nAnti-viral effects\nTheaflavin has activity against HIV replication. Theaflavin seems to inhibit HIV entry into host cells by targeting gp41, a viral glycoprotein that facilitates entry by fusion to the host cell membrane (15658). Other research suggests that theaflavin, particularly theaflavin digallate, can inhibit replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (15659). Theaflavin also has activity against influenza A and B viruses (15657).\nCardiovascular effects\nResearch in healthy individuals suggests that single 100-200 mg doses of theaflavin might improve microvascular circulation and contribute to the vascular effects of black tea (99650).\nHepatic effects\nResearch in obese animals shows that theaflavin reduces hepatic lipid accumulation and pathological liver changes, reduces alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, and ameliorates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (112773). Theaflavin regulates glycolipid metabolism, reducing synthesis and accumulation of lipids in the liver, via activation of the SIRT6/AMPK/SREBP-1/FASN signaling pathway. Expression of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6, a deacetylase enzyme) is increased, as is phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK). Expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) are reduced (112773).\nWeight loss effects\nGiving theaflavins or a theaflavin-enriched green tea extract to obese mice inhibits weight gain and lowers total fat composition of the body, but does not reduce food consumption, when compared with placebo (99648, 112773). Black tea polyphenols including theaflavin increase fecal lipid excretion and increase energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue (99649). One small clinical study in healthy, non-obese Japanese adults shows that taking theaflavin 50-100 mg daily modestly reduces body weight by 1% and total body fat by about 5%, and increases skeletal muscle by about 2%, when compared to baseline. However, it is unclear if these effects are due to theaflavin or natural weight loss (99649). It is also unclear whether theaflavin has similar effects in people who are obese."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Theanine is a major nonprotein amino acid that is chemically similar to glutamic acid (91748). It is found in tea and was first isolated from green tea in the 1940s (1463, 91743, 91745, 91748, 94127, 96335, 96336, 96342). Theanine is also found in some mushrooms (12188). L-theanine is the predominant isomer of theanine that is found naturally in tea. Most clinical research has evaluated L-theanine (96335).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. L-theanine has been used safely in clinical research in doses of up to 900 mg daily for 8 weeks (12188, 36439, 96331, 96332, 96334, 96341, 97923, 101986, 104976). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of L-theanine when used long-term.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. A specific L-theanine product (Suntheanine, Taiyo Kagaku) 200 mg twice daily has been used safely in males aged 8-12 years for up to 6 weeks (91744).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, L-theanine seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Drowsiness, headaches.\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, L-theanine may cause headaches (36439). Patients have also reported drowsiness, increased duration of sleep, and increased dream activity after oral L-theanine use (96331).\n\nA case of subtle facial tic starting within 4 days of taking L-theanine 400 mg daily has been reported for a pediatric patient. Although the tics reportedly ceased once theanine was discontinued, the child had exhibited tics in the past. Therefore, the adverse effect was not thought to be related to L-theanine (91744).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCognitive function. Oral L-theanine may improve some aspects of cognitive function. It is unclear if using L-theanine in conjunction with caffeine can enhance the effects of either ingredient.\nA single dose of L-theanine 100 mg seems to improve vigilant attention, reducing error rates in cognitive tests when compared with placebo (91747). However, taking L-theanine (Suntheanine, Taiyo Kagaku) 200 mg daily for 4 weeks does not improve verbal fluency, memory, motor speed, or executive function in an adult population, although it may moderately improve verbal fluency in a subgroup of people with lower cognitive function at baseline (101986).\n\nWhen L-theanine is combined with caffeine, a meta-analysis and multiple individual clinical studies show that the combination improves alertness, as well as accuracy during a test that requires switching attention between different tasks, but does not improve reaction time (38116, 91750, 96335, 96336). Some research also shows that L-theanine plus caffeine improves cognitive performance and reduces task-induced fatigue when compared with baseline and placebo. However, it is unclear if this is due to the individual ingredients or the combination (38116, 96335, 96336). Some research suggests that the combination is no better than either individual ingredient alone (91747, 96335, 96336).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral L-theanine, taken continuously or as a single dose, improves cognition in older adults.\nA small clinical study in healthy, Japanese adults aged 50-69 years shows that taking a specific product (Suntheanine; Taiyo International.) containing L-theanine 101 mg daily after breakfast for 12 weeks does not improve mini-mental state exam (MMSE) scores when compared with placebo. However, a single-dose analysis from this study shows that administration of L-theanine 101 mg may improve the quality of working memory and reaction times during a cognitive function test when compared with placebo (108553). Patients were permitted to consume polyphenol-rich beverages during the study period; however, consumption was not documented, limiting the validity of this finding.\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Although there is interest in using oral theanine for Alzheimer disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of theanine for this condition.\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral L-theanine is beneficial in patients with anxiety. Results of clinical research are conflicting.\nA preliminary clinical study shows that taking a single dose of a specific L-theanine product (Suntheanine, Taiyo Kagaku) 200 mg does not reduce experimentally-induced anticipatory anxiety when compared with placebo (12188). However, another preliminary clinical study in healthy adults with stress-related anxiety shows that taking L-theanine 200 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces anxiety scale scores and sleep disturbance when compared with placebo (101986).\nless\nAttention. It is unclear if oral theanine improves attention.\nA small clinical study in healthy males shows that taking a single dose of L-theanine 200 mg improves selective attention similar to a single dose of caffeine 160 mg (96337). However, other small clinical studies in adults show that taking L-theanine 100-400 mg does not improve most measures of attention, especially sustained attention or attention in executive control tasks, but doses of 100-200 mg may improve performance in simple attentional tasks when compared with placebo (96338, 111396). Some of these studies suggest that taking L-theanine with caffeine appears to provide more benefit than either individual ingredient alone (96337, 96338).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral L-theanine seems to improve some aspects of ADHD, including cognition and sleep.\nSome preliminary clinical research in children with ADHD shows that taking a one-time dose of L-theanine 2.5 mg/kg increases cognition scores, but does not improve results on sustained attention or inhibitory control tests, when compared with placebo. Taking L-theanine with caffeine 2 mg/kg also increases cognition scores and improves performance on a sustained attention test, but does not improve inhibitory control, when compared with placebo (104141). Other preliminary clinical research in males aged 8-12 years with ADHD shows that taking a specific L-theanine product (Suntheanine, Taiyo Kagaku) 200 mg orally twice daily for 6 weeks increases the percent of time spent in restful sleep by about 5% and decreases the number of bouts of nocturnal activity by about 6 when compared with placebo (91744).\nless\nCancer. Although there is interest in using oral theanine for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of theanine for this condition.\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Oral L-theanine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with colon cancer shows that taking L-cystine 700 mg and L-theanine 280 mg (Ajinomoto Co. Inc.) orally once daily, starting one week before chemotherapy with TS-1 (Taiho Pharmaceutical) and continuing for 28 days, increases the rate of therapy completion by 49%, reduces the incidence of diarrhea by 37%, reduces appetite loss by 33%, and improves the reported tolerability of chemotherapy when compared with chemotherapy alone (96334). However, this combination does not appear to be beneficial in patients with gastric cancer, or in those with colorectal cancer receiving 4 courses of capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy. (96334, 101985).\nless\nCognitive impairment. Oral L-theanine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne very small clinical study in adults with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking a product containing L-theanine 120 mg and green tea extract 720 mg (LGNC-07, LG Household & Health Care, Ltd) orally twice daily after meals for 16 weeks modestly improves memory and attention when compared with baseline. However, taking this product does not appear to improve memory and attention when patients with self-reported memory problems, but without mild cognitive impairment, are also considered (96339).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral L-theanine is beneficial in patients with depression.\nA small clinical study shows that taking a specific L-theanine product (Suntheanine, Taiyo Kagaku Co. Ltd.) 250 mg at bedtime for 8 weeks reduces symptoms and improves sleep quality when compared to baseline in individuals with mild major depressive disorder (MDD) (96331). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Another small clinical study in adults with MDD shows that taking L-theanine 200 mg daily with sertraline for 6 weeks reduces depression symptoms and increases remission rates but does not improve treatment response rates when compared with sertraline and placebo (112278). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size and short study duration. Additionally, it is unclear if the reduction in depressive symptoms is clinically significant.\nless\nErythema. Oral L-theanine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy females with self-perceived skin sensitivity shows that taking a specific supplement containing L-theanine, ashwagandha, and saffron (InnerCalm, Arbonne) daily for 8 weeks reduces facial pigmentation when compared to baseline (111399). The validity of this finding is limited by a lack of a placebo group. It is unclear if these effects are due to L-theanine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is unclear if oral L-theanine is beneficial for reducing anxiety in people with GAD.\nOne small clinical study in adults with GAD shows that taking L-theanine 225 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, then 450 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, in conjunction with prescribed antidepressants, does not reduce anxiety scores when compared with antidepressants and placebo (104976).\nless\nHypertension. Although there is interest in using oral theanine for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of theanine for this condition.\nInfluenza. Oral L-theanine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of green tea catechins (THEA-FLAN 90S, Ito-en Co.) 378 mg, standardized to contain epigallocatechin gallate 270 mg and L-theanine (Suntheanine, Taiyo Kagaku) 210 mg daily for 5 months reduces the risk of developing clinically diagnosed influenza when compared with placebo. However, the combination does not seem to prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza infection (54021).\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral L-theanine is beneficial for insomnia.\nA very small clinical study in young healthy adults with sleep quality worsened by caffeine intake shows that taking L-theanine 50 mg (Suntheanine, Taiyo Kagaku Co. Ltd) once 10 minutes before bedtime suppresses caffeine-induced elevations in wake after sleep onset time but does not improve parameters of sleep quality including sleep onset latency, sleep time, or number of times waking after sleep onset when compared with placebo (112275).\n\nL-theanine has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in adults with insomnia or disturbed sleep patterns shows that a specific product (RLX2; LiveLife Biosciences AG) containing L-theanine 50 mg and a specific casein peptide, alpha-s1-casein tryptic hydrolysate, 150 mg, taken one hour before bedtime for 4 weeks, increases sleep duration by 45 minutes and improves habitual sleep efficiency and daytime dysfunction when compared with baseline (108556). Another very small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking a combination product containing tryptophan, glycine, magnesium, tart cherry powder, and L-theanine 2 hours before bedtime decreases sleep onset latency and increases total sleep duration, leading to better sleep efficiency and reduced morning sleepiness, when compared with placebo (111184). Another combination product containing L-theanine, ashwagandha, and saffron (InnerCalm, Arbonne), taken daily for 8 weeks, seems to improve sleep quality when compared to baseline (111399). However, the validity of this finding is limited by a lack of a control group.\n\nIt is unclear if the effects described above are due to L-theanine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral L-theanine is beneficial for OCD.\nA small clinical study in adults with OCD shows that taking L-theanine 100 mg twice daily for 10 weeks with fluvoxamine reduces OCD symptoms, particularly obsessive symptoms, and increases the proportion of patients with a complete response to treatment but does not improve compulsive symptoms, partial response rates, or remission rates when compared with placebo and fluvoxamine (112276).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Oral theanine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study of adults with esophageal cancer undergoing esophagectomy shows that taking theanine 280 mg and cystine 700 mg daily, staring 4 days before surgery and continued for 13 days after surgery, does not improve measures of physical activity but does improve exercise tolerance and some measures of quality of life when compared with placebo (111400). It is unclear if these findings are due to theanine, cystine, or the combination.\nless\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral L-theanine is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia; the available evidence is limited and conflicting.\nOne small preliminary clinical study in adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder shows that taking L-theanine (Biosynergy) 200 mg orally twice daily for 8 weeks along with antipsychotic medications improves positive symptoms, anxiety, and general psychopathology symptoms, such as poor impulse control and disorientation, when compared with placebo. However, theanine does not improve general disease severity, negative symptoms, depression, cognitive function, extrapyramidal side effects, or quality of life (96341).\n\nIn contrast, two small clinical studies show that taking L-theanine 400 mg (Suntheanine, BioSynergy Health Alternatives) with antipsychotics and with or without pregnenolone 50 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces negative symptoms, general psychopathology symptoms, and anxiety when compared with placebo in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. However, there were no improvements in positive schizophrenia symptoms, extrapyramidal side effects, or symptoms of depression (97923, 112277). The inconsistency of results might be due to the small study sizes and the subjectivity of the outcomes measured.\nless\nStress. It is unclear if oral L-theanine is beneficial in patients with stress.\nOne very small clinical study shows that taking L-theanine 200 mg prior to a stress-inducing exam reduces tension-anxiety and may prevent blood pressure increases caused by psychological stress when compared with placebo (91746). Other preliminary clinical research in pharmacy students shows that taking theanine 200 mg twice daily for one week prior, and then for the first 10 days of a pharmacy practice period, decreases subjective stress scores when compared with placebo (91745). Another small clinical study in healthy young adults shows that drinking a beverage containing L-theanine 200 mg alone or combined with L-arginine 50 mg after a psychological stressor reduces stress, as measured by salivary alpha-amylase activity, when compared with placebo. The combination of L-arginine and L-theanine did not differ from L-theanine alone, suggesting that the combination does not act synergistically to reduce markers of stress (110393).\n\nHowever, not all research has been positive. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific L-theanine product (Suntheanine, Taiyo Kagaku) 200 mg induces subjective feelings of tranquility in relaxed people, but not those with experimentally-induced anticipatory anxiety, when compared with placebo (12188). Also, a small, clinical crossover study in healthy, moderately stressed adults shows that taking a single dose of a specific product (Alphawave; Ethical Naturals) containing L-theanine 200 mg prior to a stress-inducing exam does not improve anxiety at any time point when compared with placebo (108554). Due to the single-dose nature of this study, the effects of continued administration of this product are unclear.\n\nL-theanine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in adults with stress shows that taking a specific combination product (Mg-Teadiola, Sanofi-Aventis Group), containing green tea extract 125 mg (providing 50 mg L-theanine), magnesium 150 mg, vitamin B6 0.2 mg, vitamin B9 0.1 mg, vitamin B12 1.25 mcg, and rhodiola 222 mg, orally once daily for 28 days modestly improves stress and anxiety scores when compared with placebo. Improvements in stress scores, but not anxiety scores, appear to persist at 28 days after treatment completion (108672). It is unclear if any effects are due to L-theanine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nTourette syndrome. It is unclear if oral L-theanine is beneficial in children with Tourette syndrome.\nA small, nonblinded clinical study in children aged 4-17 years with untreated Tourette syndrome or with chronic tic disorder and associated symptoms of anxiety shows that taking a liquid nutritional supplement providing L-theanine 200 mg and vitamin B6 2.8 mg daily for 2 months improves scores on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale, but does not reduce anxiety, when compared with patients receiving psychoeducation (108555). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate theanine for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nL-theanine is typically used in doses of 200-400 mg daily for 4-8 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nL-theanine is the predominant isomer of theanine that is found naturally in tea. Most clinical research has evaluated L-theanine. It is not known if D-theanine has the same clinical effects as L-theanine (96335).\n\nTheanine can be prepared by one of three methods: isolation from tea leaves, chemical synthesis, or biosynthesis. Due to the high cost and low yield of theanine from tea leaf extraction, this method is less commonly used in commercial settings. However, supplements prepared by chemical synthesis may contain a racemic mixture of both L-theanine and D-theanine.\n\nOne specific L-theanine product (Suntheanine, Taiyo Kagaku) is prepared from ethylamine and glutamic acid using a specific biosynthetic strategy (94128). This product is used alone (101986) or has been combined with caffeine in some clinical studies (96335, 96336).\n\nA combination product (LGNC-07, LG Household & Health Care, Ltd) containing L-theanine and green tea extract has also been used in clinical research. Each capsule of this product contains green tea extract 360 mg, theanine 60 mg, silicon dioxide 5.7 mg, and magnesium stearate 4.3 mg (96339).\n\nA commercially available supplement containing L-theanine 280 mg and L-cystine 700 mg (Ajinomoto) is available in the United States and Japan (101985).",

            "Interactions with Conditions": "None known.",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with theanine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nTheanine is absorbed through the intestines (77320, 77326). The peak concentration of L-theanine in the plasma occurs at about 50 minutes after oral intake (91743, 91747, 96337). There appears to be similar absorption of L-theanine from both supplements and green tea (91743).\nDistribution\nFollowing absorption, L-theanine is distributed to the plasma and erythrocytes (91743). L-theanine can cross the blood brain barrier and appears to do so in a dose-dependent manner (96331, 96341).\nMetabolism\nL-theanine is hydrolyzed in the intestines to ethylamine and glutamic acid (91743, 96333, 96334). The elimination half-life of L-theanine from plasma ranges from 0.8-1.2 hours (91743).\nExcretion\nA small amount of L-theanine is retained in erythrocytes, but most L-theanine and its metabolites are excreted in the urine 3-24 hours after oral intake (91743). Only about 2.4% to 3.1% of ingested L-theanine is excreted unmetabolized; most ingested L-theanine is excreted as ethylamine and glutamic acid (91743).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTheanine is the major amino acid found in tea. Tea contains 1% to 3% theanine (7685, 7690, 96335, 96341). This can be as much as 60 mg per 200 mL serving, but is typically between 4.5 mg and 24.5 mg (96335, 96336, 96337). The predominant form is L-theanine (98%) (96335). Theanine is also found in some mushrooms (12188, 96335, 96336, 96342).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that administering L-theanine along with L-cysteine perioperatively decreases biomarkers of inflammation after surgery. It is thought that this combination reduces blood levels of interleukin (IL)-6 following surgery by preventing decreases in glutathione levels (91742).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is interest in using theanine adjunctively for cancer. In studies involving doxorubicin, theanine increases its concentration in tumors by blocking efflux of the drug from tumor cells (7688, 7690, 8668, 8669). Theanine also appears to increase the concentration of doxorubicin in tumor cells by inhibiting glutamate transporters (77323, 77330). Theanine seems to enhance the effects of doxorubicin on drug sensitive and multi-drug resistant tumors (7688, 8668, 8669). Theanine may also enhance the suppressive action of doxorubicin on metastatic tumors (8312). Animal research also shows that theanine decreases doxorubicin-induced toxicity related to oxidative damage by increasing glutamate concentrations (53718). Theanine also appears to decrease diarrhea and loss of appetite and improve rates of chemotherapy completion in patients with colon cancer (96334).\n\nAnimal research shows that theanine inhibits the efflux of pirarubicin from ovarian cancer cells (77321). Similarly, theanine inhibits the efflux of idarubicin from leukemia cells in animal models (7689). Additionally, theanine seems to decrease the toxicity of idarubicin by reversing adverse effects on leukocytes and bone marrow cells (7689).\nAntidepressant effects\nL-theanine resembles L-glutamate in structure, and competes with glutamate at its receptors, although it has a lower affinity for these receptors. It is likely that L-theanine's antidepressant effects are related to its effects on the glutamate pathway, regulating the amounts of glutamate and glutamine in the brain (96331). In animals, supplementation with L-theanine leads to recovery of impairment and augmentation of synaptic plasticity in the brain. Glutamate signaling regulates synaptic plasticity, and it is speculated that L-theanine's effects on depression could thus be related to its effect on synaptic plasticity (96331).\nAntioxidant effects\nAfter absorption, L-theanine breaks down to glutamic acid and ethylamine. Within the cell, cysteine and glutamic acid are combined with glycine to form the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). L-theanine's effect on attenuating toxicity secondary to chemotherapy is thought to be secondary to increases in intracellular GSH concentrations within organs that are affected by chemotherapy (96334).\nAnxiolytic effects\nL-theanine's anxiolytic effects might be due to its effects on glutamate receptors and the possibility it increases inhibitory neurotransmitters such as glycine or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (96331).\nAttention effects\nL-theanine, alone and in combination with caffeine, has been studied for its effects on alpha-wave activity as a measure of attention. L-theanine appears to increase alpha activity when measured during rest. In clinical research, a lower dosage of L-theanine did not significantly decrease tonic (background) alpha, indicating a possible dose-dependent effect. Consuming either L-theanine or caffeine alone was no different than placebo. However, when L-theanine 100 mg was combined with caffeine 50 mg, tonic alpha decreased significantly (96338).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using theanine for hypertension. In animal models, theanine decreases norepinephrine levels (7686, 77339), which decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure (7687, 8670, 77354). However, preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking a one-time dose of L-theanine 200 mg does not reduce blood pressure or heart rate when compared with placebo (104142). There is some evidence that theanine might induce an excitatory effect when used in very small doses, suggesting that the effects of theanine may be dose-dependent (8665).\n\nSome research shows that theanine suppresses the stimulant effects of caffeine (7685, 8665, 36435). However, other studies have not demonstrated this antagonistic effect (38116, 91748).\n\nGreen tea, which contains L-theanine, might prevent atherosclerosis by inhibiting the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls. However, theanine doesn't seem to affect smooth muscle (8666). There is evidence to suggest theanine might prevent the development of atherosclerosis by inhibiting lipid peroxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (8667).\nCognitive effects\nL-theanine seems to have some effects on cognitive function. In animals, supplementation with L-theanine lead to recovery of impairment and augmentation of synaptic plasticity in the brain. Glutamate signaling regulates synaptic plasticity, and it is speculated that theanine's effects on cognition could thus be related to its effect on synaptic plasticity (96331). Theanine may also affect alpha and theta wave activity. Increases in alpha power indicate relaxation (96335, 96336), whereas increases in theta power tend to indicate cognitive alertness. In clinical research, taking a product containing L-theanine and green tea extract (LGNC-07, LG Household & Health Care, Ltd) increased theta power when patients had their eyes open and when they were reading, but decreased theta power when patients had their eyes closed (96339). Other clinical research in healthy, moderately stressed adults shows that taking a single dose of a specific product (Alphawave; Ethical Naturals) containing L-theanine 200 mg prior to a stress-inducing test increases alpha power when patients have their eyes open, but does not affect theta power, when compared with placebo (108554).\n\nL-theanine also appears to protect against the toxic effects of caffeine and may inhibit the excitatory effects of caffeine at higher doses allowing for improved performance on certain cognitive tests (96336, 96341).\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn vitro research shows that L-theanine may help the body's immune system response when fighting infection by boosting the disease-fighting capacity of gamma-delta T cells (54021, 77329).\n\nTheanine is also a precursor of glutamate, and when combined with cystine (a dipeptide of cysteine), may increase glutathione concentrations. Glutathione levels may correlate with the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and regulate inflammatory responses in neutrophils. Theanine also induces priming of peripheral blood gamma-delta T cells (96332, 96333). It is thought that resistance training and prolonged exercise lead to negative effects on the immune system including decreased lymphocyte proliferation and NK cell activity. Clinical research shows that ingestion of a combination product containing L-cystine 700 mg and L-theanine 280 mg (Ajinomoto Co., Inc.) may attenuate decreases in NK cell activity seen in the placebo group, when individuals are exposed to high-intensity and high-frequency exercise (96332). It may also attenuate increases in C-reactive protein and neutrophils (96333). However, supplementation with this combination did not appear to affect plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, serum immunoglobulin M (IgM), leucocyte count, salivary IgA levels, or lymphocyte proliferation activity compared to placebo (96332, 96333).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nL-theanine has been used for its purported relaxing and anti-anxiety effects. It's thought that L-theanine might work for anxiety by increasing levels of GABA and serotonin (12188, 36439, 91750). L-theanine is also thought to work for stress-induced anxiety by reducing the release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter (91745).\n\nL-theanine inhibits the reuptake of glutamate and is a glutamate receptor antagonist in the hippocampus. In animals, L-theanine may be neuroprotective via actions on the GABAA receptor (96337).\n\nThere is interest in using L-theanine for dementia. Levels of glutamate increase and cause neuronal death during periods of cerebral ischemia. L-theanine demonstrates a protective effect by decreasing ischemic neuronal death in the forebrains of animal models (7685, 77342). The antagonistic effects of L-theanine on glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors might provide neuroprotection (7685, 77328).\n\nThere is interest in using L-theanine for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder given its antioxidant, neuroprotective, and relaxant effects. L-theanine has been reported to have antioxidant effects in vitro, via inhibition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. L-theanine is considered to be neuroprotective and may protect against cerebral ischemia, glutamate toxicity, and may stimulate the release of nerve growth factor. It may decrease glutamate reuptake through inhibition of the glutamate transporter. Research in animals suggests the neuroprotective effects of theanine are due to its ability to block N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and GABAA receptors. L-theanine is structurally similar to glutamate and may act as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist and increase GABA levels in the brain, leading to relaxation. GABA then can influence levels of dopamine and serotonin. Also, L-theanine simulates the production of alpha waves in the brain also leading to relaxation and mental alertness (96341). Theanine also appears to lower cortisol production through relaxation and reduction of stress (96342).\n\nIn clinical research, treatment with L-theanine 400 mg daily for 8 weeks improved anxiety and positive symptoms of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (96341, 96342). Further research suggests there is an association between the beneficial effects of L-theanine on clinical symptoms and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and the cortisol to dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) ratio (96342). BDNF has multiple effects on the development of neurons. It is also involved in neuronal survival and the plasticity of synapses of various neurons in the central nervous system including dopaminergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic. In research, decreases in BDNF were associated with improvements in the reduction of dysphoric mood and anxiety. The ratio of cortisol to DHEAS (or dehydroepiandrosterone) is used to detect the balance between anabolic and catabolic processes in mental disorders. In research, increases in the cortisol to DHEAS*100 molar ratio was associated with improvements in positive symptoms scores, specifically activation and dysphoric mood. Decreases in this ratio were associated with a reduction in anxiety scores. These changes may mediate the effects of L-theanine on clinical symptoms, but the true meaning of these associations is unknown. Also, levels of serum insulin, cholesterol, cortisol, DHEA, nor DHEAS did not predict improvement in clinical symptoms.\n\nThere is also interest in using L-theanine for depression. Animal research shows that L-theanine might decrease serotonin and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5HIAA) concentrations in the brain. L-theanine might enhance the degradation of serotonin, and it might also directly inhibit the enzyme responsible for serotonin synthesis (7687, 8670, 77354). Theoretically, theanine may compete with glutamate and/or increase plasma gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels (96331, 96334). Preliminary clinical research in adults with depression has found that increases in plasma GABA levels may be associated with very short-term improvement in response to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, these associations have not been consistently replicated (109010, 109011).\n\nThe effects of theanine on depression, alone or in combination with SSRIs, have not been studied. However, preliminary clinical research in adults with mild depression shows that taking L-theanine 250 mg orally for 8 weeks reduces symptoms and improves sleep quality when compared with baseline (96331).\nWeight loss effects\nAnimal research suggests L-theanine may act synergistically with caffeine and other constituents in green tea to cause weight loss (11960). In animals, L-theanine increases liver glycogen synthesis and reduces gluconeogenesis (101987)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Thiamine is a water-soluble B vitamin. Thiamine is not made endogenously in humans, therefore it needs to be consumed in the diet or taken as a supplement (77494). Thiamine is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulations (15).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established for thiamine, and doses up to 50 mg daily have been used without adverse effects (15, 6243). ...when used intravenously or intramuscularly and appropriately. Injectable thiamine is an FDA-approved prescription product (15, 105445).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in dietary amounts. A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established for healthy individuals (6243).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used orally in dietary amounts of 1.4 mg daily. A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established for healthy individuals (3094, 6243).",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally and parenterally, thiamine is generally well tolerated.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nParenterally: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and anaphylaxis.\nImmunologic\nOrally, thiamine might rarely cause dermatitis and other allergic reactions. Parenterally, thiamine can cause anaphylactoid and hypersensitivity reactions, but this is also rare (<0.1%). Reported symptoms and events include feelings of warmth, tingling, pruritus, urticaria, tightness of the throat, cyanosis, respiratory distress, gastrointestinal bleeding, pulmonary edema, angioedema, hypotension, and death (15, 35585, 105445).\n\nIn one case report, a 46-year-old female presented with systemic allergic dermatitis after applying a specific product (Inzitan, containing lidocaine, dexamethasone, cyanocobalamin and thiamine) topically by iontophoresis; the allergic reaction was attributed to thiamine (91170).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nThiamine deficiency. Oral thiamine prevents and treats thiamine deficiency syndromes.\nThiamine deficiency is treated with oral thiamine 5-30 mg daily as a single dose or in divided daily doses for one month. For severe deficiency, thiamine up to 300 mg daily can be used (15).Thiamine deficiency can occur in people with malabsorption conditions such as alcohol use disorder, cirrhosis, and gastrointestinal diseases; in those with inadequate intake due to anorexia, nausea, and vomiting; and in those with increased requirements, including pregnancy, increased carbohydrate intake, increased physical activity, hyperthyroidism, infection, and liver disease. However, deficiency is rare with these conditions (15). The elderly might also be at increased risk for subclinical thiamine deficiency (11076).\nless\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). Parenteral thiamine is effective for treating symptoms of WKS.\nParenteral administration of thiamine 5-200 mg daily for 2 days decreases the risk of developing WKS and decreases symptoms of WKS in acute alcohol withdrawal. Between 30% and 80% of alcoholics are suspected to have thiamine deficiency (11075). An optimal dose for treating WKS has not been established; however, early research suggests that a 200 mg intramuscular dose may be more effective than lower doses (11075). In contrast, a moderate-sized clinical trial in adults with a history of heavy alcohol use who were asymptomatic or symptomatic for WKS shows that there is no benefit to administering high doses (300 mg 3 times daily) compared with medium (100 mg 3 times daily) or low (100 mg daily) doses of parenteral thiamine on cognitive or neurological functioning (111690). The study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDysmenorrhea. Oral thiamine might reduce pain in some patients with dysmenorrhea.\nA clinical study in adolescent Iranian females with dysmenorrhea shows that taking thiamine 100 mg alone or along with fish oil 500 mg daily for 2 months moderately reduces pain intensity and duration when compared with placebo (89341). Another preliminary clinical study in Indian females 12-21 years of age with moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea shows that taking thiamine 100 mg daily for 90 days eliminates pain in 87% of participants when compared to baseline (77820). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo group. Furthermore, available research was conducted in India and Iran, so it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Intravenous thiamine does not seem to improve outcomes after CABG surgery.\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing CABG surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass shows that giving intravenous thiamine 200 mg immediately prior to surgery and immediately after surgery does not improve clinical outcomes or lactate levels when compared with placebo (97010). Larger doses of thiamine also don't seem to be beneficial. Another small clinical study in patients receiving CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass shows that giving thiamine 600 mg intravenously on the day of surgery, and 400 mg daily for three postoperative days, does not improve postoperative outcomes when compared with placebo (103000).\nless\nHeart failure. Most research suggests that oral or intravenous thiamine does not improve outcomes in patients with heart failure.\nObservational research suggests that having heart failure is associated with 2.5-fold increased odds of having thiamine deficiency, possibly because of diuretic use, intestinal malabsorption, and metabolism changes. However, it is unclear if thiamine supplementation is beneficial. A meta-analysis of 2 small clinical trials in adults with systolic heart failure and unclear thiamine status shows that thiamine 200-300 mg given orally or by IV for 7-28 days improves left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by 3% when compared with control (97012). However, other meta-analyses and clinical studies in adults with heart failure with or without thiamine deficiency show that taking intravenous, intramuscular, or oral thiamine 100-500 mg daily does not improve LVEF fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, dyspnea, mortality, hospitalization, or exercise tolerance when compared with placebo or control (103002, 111682, 111686, 111688).\nless\nMosquito repellent. Oral thiamine does not seem to repel mosquitos.\nClinical research in healthy volunteers shows that taking thiamine does not improve mosquito repellency when compared with taking vitamin C as a control (18016).\nless\nSepsis. Intravenous or oral thiamine, alone or in combination with vitamin C and hydrocortisone, does not seem to reduce mortality or prevent organ failure in sepsis or septic shock.\nMultiple meta-analyses of small clinical studies in patients with septic shock show that intravenous or oral thiamine 100-500 mg 2-3 times daily for 3-7 days is no better than placebo for improving mortality, end-organ damage, number of ventilator-free days, and duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (105443, 107717, 107727, 111689). One meta-analysis suggests that administration of thiamine alone increases the risk of mortality in these patients (111689). Subgroup analyses including only higher quality studies also fail to show a benefit of thiamine (107717). Another recent small clinical trial in patients with septic shock shows that receiving the same dose of intravenous thiamine does not increase vasopressor-free days when compared with placebo (105441).\n\nIntravenous thiamine 200 mg every 12 hours has also been evaluated in combination with intravenous vitamin C 1.5-2 grams and hydrocortisone 50-200 mg every 6-12 hours for 4-10 days (HAT therapy). While some retrospective research found HAT therapy to be beneficial (100315, 102980, 111689), high-quality, prospective clinical research has shown no benefit (105447, 109956, 111689). Meta-analyses in patients with sepsis and septic shock shows that receiving HAT therapy does not improve mortality, kidney injury, number of ventilator-free days, or ICU length of stay when compared with control (102129, 104027, 104028, 104032, 102998, 105447, 109956, 111642, 111689). Additionally, the meta-analyses suggest that HAT therapy does not reverse shock or improve sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (109556, 111642). However, one meta-analysis found that HAT therapy shortened the duration of vasopressor use when compared with placebo (111642). Long-term follow up from a study in patients with sepsis-induced respiratory and/or cardiovascular dysfunction shows that receiving HAT therapy does not improve cognitive, psychological, or functional status after 6 months and, for immediate memory scores and development of posttraumatic stress disorder, HAT therapy was less beneficial when compared with placebo (111299).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcute kidney injury (AKI). It is unclear if oral or intravenous thiamine is beneficial for treating or preventing AKI.\nObservational research in adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with AKI has found that treatment with thiamine (dose unspecified) within the first 48 hours of admission is associated with 39% lower odds of in-hospital mortality and 28% higher odds of kidney function recovery when compared with patients that did not receive thiamine. Receiving thiamine was also associated with a 0.5-day reduction in ICU length of stay (107719).\nless\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is unclear if oral thiamine is beneficial for AMD.\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) observational study has found that higher thiamine intake from foods and supplements is associated with a 38% lower relative odds of late AMD, but not early AMD, in adults 40 years and older when compared with lower intake (113552). However, observational studies in older adults have found no clear association between dietary thiamine intake and risk of early or late AMD over an average follow-up of 10 years (116749, 116750). It is unclear if these differing findings are due to the inclusion of thiamine supplements in the first study or due to other confounding factors.\nless\nAnxiety. Although there is interest in using oral thiamine for anxiety, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of thiamine for this purpose.\nCardiac arrest. It is unclear if intravenous thiamine reduces the risk of death after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.\nA small clinical study in adults resuscitated from cardiac arrest shows that receiving intravenous thiamine 100 mg every 8 hours for 7 days does not reduce 28-day mortality when compare with a normal saline placebo (105442).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral thiamine is beneficial for treating or preventing CVD.\nPopulation research in Korea has found that insufficient dietary thiamine intake (daily intake of less than 1.22 mg in males or 1.03 mg in females) is associated with a 16% increased odds of developing angina or myocardial infarction when compared with sufficient dietary thiamine. However, the effects of thiamine supplementation on CVD have not been studied (107725).\nless\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. Oral thiamine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing thiamine along with alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylserine, turmeric, and vitamins C, E, B2, B6, and B12 twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain, but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function, when compared with control (111702). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding and dosing information. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to thiamine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCataracts. Small studies suggest that increased dietary thiamine might help prevent cataracts.\nObservational research has found that a high dietary intake of thiamine 10 mg daily is associated with 40% lower odds of nuclear cataracts (6378). Other population research has found that higher dietary intake of thiamine is associated with a modestly reduced risk of age-related lens opacification (14301).\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral thiamine reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer.\nEpidemiological research has found that increasing intake of thiamine from dietary and supplemental sources, along with folic acid, riboflavin, and vitamin B12, is associated with a lower odds of precancerous cervical lesions (11074).\nless\nChild development. It is unclear if supplementing breastfeeding females with oral thiamine improves infant neurocognitive development.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that supplementing breastfeeding females with oral thiamine, 1.2-10 mg daily for 22 weeks, starting at 2 weeks postpartum, does not improve most cognitive or neurodevelopmental scores in the child when compared with placebo. However, one subgroup analysis suggests that thiamine supplementation may improve language scores (107726).\nless\nCognitive function. Oral thiamine has only been studied in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nObservational research in adults 60 years and older has found that higher dietary thiamine intake is associated with better cognitive function when compared with lower intake (116112). However, a clinical study in healthy, middle-aged adults shows that taking a combination product containing thiamine hydrochloride 50 mg, other group B vitamins, bacopa, and ginkgo daily for 12 weeks does not improve measures of memory, attention, cognition, mood, or stress reactivity when compared with placebo (111334).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if intravenous or oral thiamine improves clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\nA small observational study of adults admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19 has found that treatment with intravenous or oral thiamine 100 mg daily for an average of 7 days is associated with a 63% reduction in the odds of death within 30 days when compared with control. However, there was no associated reduction in duration of hospitalization or mechanical ventilation (107721). In addition, a small observational study of adults with encephalopathy that were mechanically ventilated secondary to COVID-19 has found that taking thiamine 500 mg three times daily orally for 5 days improves neurological manifestations, including ophthalmoparesis and ataxia, when compared with baseline. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group (107722).\nless\nCritical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral or intravenous thiamine is beneficial in patients with critical illness.\nA meta-analysis of critically ill patients shows that treatment with oral or intravenous thiamine 100-600 mg daily for up to 7 days does not affect the need for mechanical ventilation, duration of hospital stay, or mortality when compared with control (107727).\nless\nDelirium. It is unclear if oral or intravenous thiamine helps to prevent or treat delirium.\nIn critically ill patients, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that treatment with oral or intravenous thiamine 100-600 mg daily for up to 7 days reduces the odds of developing delirium by 42% when compared with control (107727). However, some observational research in adults with septic shock has found that receiving intravenous thiamine 400 mg daily with vitamin C 6 grams daily, both in divided doses, is not associated with reduced delirium when compared with control (103001).\n\nIn non-critically ill, hospitalized adults with altered mental status, retrospective, observational research has also found that administration of oral or intravenous thiamine is not associated with improved cognitive function or reduced in-hospital mortality when compared with control (107723). Preliminary clinical research in adults undergoing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant also shows that administering thiamine 200 mg three times a day intravenously for 7 days does not prevent delirium or shorten duration of delirium when compared with placebo (107718).\nless\nDementia. It is unclear if oral thiamine is beneficial for the prevention of dementia.\nObservational research in patients with alcohol use disorder has found that taking thiamine is associated with a 24% to 46% lower risk of developing dementia when compared with not taking thiamine (102999).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral thiamine is beneficial in patients with depression.\nMeta-analyses of population research in adults has found that high dietary consumption of thiamine is associated with a 10% to 31% lower risk of having depression when compared with low dietary consumption of thiamine. However, this research did not evaluate the effects of thiamine supplementation on depression (107133, 107725). One small clinical study in adults with major depressive disorder shows that taking thiamine 300 mg daily in conjunction with fluoxetine 20 mg daily leads to greater improvements in depressive symptoms at 6 weeks when compared to fluoxetine with placebo. This benefit was no longer present at 12 weeks. This suggests that thiamine may accelerate improvement in symptoms during initiation of fluoxetine therapy (97013).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral thiamine is beneficial for type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of 6 clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking thiamine 100-300 mg or its derivative benfotiamine 120-900 mg daily for 1-3 months does not reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, or postprandial blood glucose when compared with placebo (111681). A large, prospective cohort study in adults without type 2 diabetes suggests that the risk of new-onset diabetes is minimized in adults consuming thiamine 0.75-1.10 mg daily from the diet, while lower and higher thiamine intake levels are associated with an increased risk of new-onset diabetes (111685).\n\nThiamine has also been studied for preventing gestational diabetes. A large, prospective cohort study in pregnant adults suggests that higher supplementation with thiamine during the first and second trimesters is associated with a lower risk of gestational diabetes when compared with lower levels of total thiamine intake. However, this effect was not found for dietary intake of thiamine, only supplementation. Additionally, the participants were mostly Han Chinese adults, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other populations (111680).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral thiamine is beneficial for diabetic nephropathy.\nA small clinical study in patients with early-stage diabetic nephropathy and microalbuminuria shows that taking thiamine 100 mg three times daily for 3 months decreases urinary albumin excretion, but does not affect glomerular filtration rate (GFR), when compared with placebo (16556).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Although there is interest in using oral thiamine for diabetic neuropathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of thiamine for this condition.\nDry eye. Oral thiamine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with dry eye suggests that adding unspecified doses of thiamine and mecobalamin to treatment with daily artificial tears and corticosteroid drops might slightly improve overall symptoms when compared with only artificial tears and corticosteroid drops for 1 month. There were no differences between groups at 2 months (105444). This finding is limited due to incomplete reporting and a lack of adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing.\nless\nDyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral thiamine is beneficial for treating or preventing dyslipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking thiamine 100-300 mg or its derivative benfotiamine 120-900 mg daily for 1-3 months does not improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with placebo (111681). Observational research in Korea suggests that insufficient dietary thiamine intake (daily intake of less than 1.22 mg in males or 1.03 mg in females) is associated with 10% higher odds of developing dyslipidemia when compared with sufficient dietary thiamine intake. However, the effects of thiamine supplementation on dyslipidemia have not been studied (107725).\nless\nEmergence delirium. It is unclear if intravenous thiamine helps to prevent emergence delirium in patients after surgery.\nOne clinical study in adults in the intensive care unit (ICU) after gastrointestinal surgery shows that receiving intravenous thiamine 200 mg daily for 3 days is associated with up to 84% lower odds of emergence delirium on the first two days, but not on the third day, when compared with a normal saline control (105440).\nless\nFatigue. It is unclear if oral thiamine is beneficial in patients with fatigue.\nA small clinical crossover study in patients with chronic fatigue and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) shows that taking thiamine 600-1800 mg daily for 20 days reduces fatigue scores when compared with placebo (105438). Taking oral thiamine 300 mg daily for an additional 12 weeks did not seem to affect fatigue scores when compared with placebo. However, an observational follow-up study found that those who self-continued thiamine for an additional 24 weeks after the study ended reported lower fatigue scores when compared with those who did not self-continue thiamine (107720).\nless\nGlaucoma. Although there is interest in using oral thiamine for glaucoma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of thiamine for this condition.\nHerpes zoster (shingles). It is unclear if subcutaneous thiamine is beneficial in patients with shingles.\nA small clinical trial shows that receiving subcutaneous thiamine 100 mg injections six times weekly for 4 weeks reduces itching by at least 30% in 67% of patients with herpes zoster. However, thiamine does not appear to significantly reduce pain in most patients (90396).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral thiamine is beneficial in treating or preventing hypertension.\nPopulation research in Korea has found that insufficient dietary thiamine intake (daily intake of less than 1.22 mg in males or 1.03 mg in females) is associated with a 5% increased odds of developing hypertension when compared with sufficient dietary thiamine. However, the effects of thiamine supplementation on hypertension have not been studied (107725).\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral thiamine is beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nA very small clinical trial in patients with prediabetes shows that taking thiamine 100 mg by mouth three times daily for 6 weeks modestly decreases 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose levels when compared to baseline and decreases fasting blood glucose levels when compared with placebo (91168).\nless\nKidney failure. Oral thiamine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary, low-quality, clinical research in adults with kidney failure undergoing regular hemodialysis shows that taking oral thiamine 90 mg daily with folic acid 30 mg daily for 96 weeks reduces overall mortality by 67% and improves cognitive scores by 31% when compared with no intervention (107724). It is unclear if this effect is due to thiamine, folic acid, or the combination.\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if dietary thiamine is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of migraine headache.\nA large, retrospective, cross-sectional study suggests that higher dietary intake of thiamine is associated with lower odds of severe headache or migraine, especially in females (111684). The validity of these effects is limited by the subjective outcome measures and retrospective study design.\nless\nPain (acute). Oral thiamine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study in adults with acute cervical sprains shows that taking thiamine 100 mg, vitamin B12 0.5 mg, vitamin B6 50 mg, and dexketoprofen 25 mg 3 times daily for 7 days modestly reduces pain scores and disability at days 3, 5 and 7 when compared with dexketoprofen alone (115689). It is unclear whether these improvements are clinically significant, as well as whether any effects are due to thiamine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPneumonia. It is unclear if thiamine is beneficial for patients with pneumonia.\nA large retrospective cohort study in adults hospitalized with pneumonia and active alcohol use disorder suggests that parenteral administration of thiamine is associated with reduced 14-day mortality and more frequent discharges home, but not a shorter length of stay or fewer ICU transfers, when compared with no thiamine use. Furthermore, parenteral thiamine doses above 200 mg do not appear to improve mortality but may be associated with longer length of stay and less frequent discharges home when compared with low oral doses of thiamine or parenteral thiamine at doses under 200 mg (111679). The validity of these effects is limited by the retrospective study design.\nless\nVentilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). It is unclear if oral or parenteral thiamine is beneficial for patients with VAP.\nA retrospective study in adults with VAP in the intensive care unit (ICU) suggests that supplementation with intravenous or oral thiamine may be associated with reduced ICU and in-hospital mortality (111683). The validity of these effects is limited by the retrospective study design.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate thiamine for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGeneral: In adults, the daily recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for thiamine is 1.2 mg for males 18 years and older, 1 mg for females 18 years of age, and 1.1 mg for females 19 years and older. The RDA during pregnancy and lactation is 1.4 mg (6243). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nCertain foods might reduce the bioavailability of thiamine in the body. Excessive ingestion of tannins, such as in coffee and tea, can convert thiamine into a form that cannot be absorbed (9535, 10539, 10540, 10544). Although this interaction has been linked to thiamine deficiency in a rural Thai population consuming more than 1 liter of tea daily and/or chronically chewing fermented tea leaves (10537, 10538), people with adequate thiamine and vitamin C consumption do not seem to be at risk for deficiency (10538, 10539, 10540).\n\nAdditionally, frequent ingestion of raw fish or shellfish can contribute to thiamine deficiency. Raw seafood contains thiaminase enzymes, which degrade thiamine (9535, 10537, 10538). Since these enzymes are destroyed by heat, consumption of cooked seafood does not affect thiamine levels.\nParenterally:Thiamine has been used in intramuscular, intravenous, and subcutaneous formulations. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nGeneral: For infants, the daily adequate intake (AI) for thiamine is 0.2 mg for 0-6 months of age and 0.3 mg for 7-12 months of age. For older children, the daily recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 0.5 mg for 1-3 years of age, 0.6 mg for 4-8 years of age, 0.9 mg for 9-13 years of age, 1.2 mg for males 14-17 years of age, and 1 mg for females 14-18 years of age (6243).\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn foods, thiamine is typically present as thiamine diphosphate.

However, there isn't enough research to recommend routine thiamine supplementation. Thiamine deficiency has been reported with other chemotherapy regimens, but this is likely due to reduced dietary intake associated with cancer and its treatment (10553, 10554).\nless\nANTIBIOTIC DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, antibiotics might reduce thiamine absorption; however, this is not likely to be clinically significant.\nInterference with the normal gastrointestinal flora by antibiotics may reduce bacterial synthesis of thiamine. However, the majority of the daily thiamine requirement is obtained from the diet, rather than synthesis by the GI flora (9502). Therefore, this isn't likely to be clinically significant, and thiamine supplements aren't necessary.\nless\nCONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nINSIGNIFICANT\nA supplement is not needed for most patients.\nTheoretically, contraceptive drugs might reduce thiamine absorption; however, this is not likely to be clinically significant.\nSome studies have reported a small reduction in activity of the thiamine-dependent enzyme erythrocyte transketolase in females taking oral contraceptives, suggesting mild thiamine deficiency (10548, 10555). However, other studies have found no effect (10527, 10556). Routine use of thiamine supplements with oral contraceptives isn't necessary.\nless\nDIURETIC DRUGS\nDepletion Rating\nMODERATE\nMonitor for depletion; a supplement is needed in some patients.\nHigh doses of diuretics can increase thiamine excretion and increase the risk of deficiency.\nIncreased urinary thiamine excretion and thiamine deficiency may occur in some people treated with diuretics, especially in high doses (e.g., more than 80 mg furosemide daily) for several months (1283, 1284, 1286, 10507, 10508, 91173). Although most case reports involve furosemide, animal data suggest that the effect may occur with any diuretic (10509). Diuretic-induced thiamine deficiency appears to be most common in elderly people with inadequate dietary intake and to be rare in people less than 60 years of age (1283, 10506, 10507). Thiamine deficiency in people taking diuretics is a concern because it might worsen heart failure (1284, 1285, 1286, 10507, 91173). Limited research suggests that supplementation with thiamine 200 mg daily may improve left ventricular ejection fraction and functional capacity in some thiamine-deficient people treated with high doses of furosemide for heart failure (1284, 1286, 10508). However, other studies have found no improvement (1285). It's too soon to recommend routine thiamine supplementation for people on prolonged, high-dose diuretic therapy. Monitor for thiamine deficiency.\nless\nMETFORMIN (Glucophage)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nTheoretically, metformin might reduce thiamine activity.\nThiamine is involved in the entrance of glycolytic pyruvate into the mitochondrial Kreb's cycle. Reducing thiamine activity might lead to increased amounts of pyruvate being converted to lactic acid. This effect might be responsible for some of the cases of lactic acidosis associated with metformin. This theoretical effect is based on preclinical animal research with phenformin, a similar drug that was produced prior to metformin (9536). This has not yet been substantiated in humans or with the use of metformin (11466).\nless\nPHENYTOIN (Dilantin)\nDepletion Rating\nINSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE\nClinical significance is not known.\nTheoretically, phenytoin might reduce thiamine levels.\nSome evidence suggests that chronic treatment with phenytoin might reduce levels of thiamine in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, and reduce uptake of thiamine into nerve tissue (10510, 10511, 10512). Theoretically, this could contribute to side effects of phenytoin such as polyneuropathy and cerebellar ataxia (10510, 10511). However, it isn't clear whether affected patients also had other factors contributing to thiamine deficiency, such as dietary insufficiency. There isn't enough evidence to recommend routine thiamine supplementation.\nless",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with thiamine. A tolerable upper intake level (UL) for thiamine has not been established for healthy individuals (6243).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOrally, thiamine is absorbed at the proximal part of the small intestine. At smaller doses it is absorbed by active transport, and at higher doses it is absorbed by passive diffusion (77376).\nDistribution\nThiamine is distributed into the skeletal muscle, the heart, the liver, the kidneys, and the brain (77395).\nMetabolism\nThiamine is phosphorylated during intestinal uptake. Most of thiamine in the adult human body occurs as the metabolically active form thiamine diphosphate (thiamin pyrophosphate or TDP) (77806).\nExcretion\nThiamine and its metabolites are excreted in the urine, and urinary thiamine is used as a biomarker for the assessment of thiamine intake (77359, 77429, 77492, 77807).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThiamine is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin, previously known as vitamin B1 or aneurine. Dietary sources of thiamine include beef, brewer's yeast, legumes (beans, lentils), nuts, oats, pork, rice, seeds, wheat, whole-grain cereals, and yeast. Thiamine is also found in fruit (such as oranges), milk, and milk products (47094, 77372, 77482). In industrialized countries, foods made with white rice or white flour are often fortified with thiamine because most of the naturally occurring thiamine is lost during the refinement process. Thiamine is not endogenously synthesized in humans. Thiamine can be synthesized by prokaryotes, yeasts, and plants (35570, 77517, 77519).\n\nThiamine deficiency leads to decreased transketolase activity in erythrocytes and increased pyruvic acid concentration in the blood (15). Pyruvic acid is converted to lactic acid. Therefore, lactic acidosis can also occur in patients with thiamine deficiency (15). In Crohn's disease, decreased serum thiamine levels have been reported (6269).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nThiamine is required for carbohydrate metabolism. It combines with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form thiamine diphosphate, a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism, wherein the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid occurs. This coenzyme is also a part of transketolation reactions. Thiamine is also a coenzyme in the utilization of pentose in the hexose monophosphate shunt (15, 77473, 77499, 77502).\n\nPreliminary animal data also suggests thiamine deficiency in diabetics may exacerbate the development of diabetic nephropathy (11467). In diabetic nephropathy, it is thought that dysfunction of glomerular endothelial cells, podocytes, and tubular epithelial cells, may be reversed by increasing the plasma concentration of thiamine. This might improve glomerular and tubular structure and function and vascular inflammation thereby decreasing urinary albumin excretion (16556).\nCarcinogenic effects\nThiamine activates the transketolase enzyme which then may promote nucleic acid ribose synthesis and cancer cell proliferation (77371, 77834). It is unclear if thiamine intake should be limited in some cancer patients (77375, 77834).\nCardiovascular effects\nSevere thiamine deficiency can precipitate a specific type of heart failure called wet beriberi. Beriberi is characterized by anorexia; abdominal discomfort; constipation; peripheral neurologic changes; sleep disturbance; poor memory; and, sometimes, cardiovascular symptoms, including dyspnea, edema, palpitations, vasodilation, warm extremities, and high output cardiac failure (3041). Beriberi can be reversed by thiamine supplementation.\n\nThiamine may also be beneficial for other types of heart failure. Thiamine deficiency can occur due to cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and medications commonly given to heart failure patients (44141, 44090, 56398, 77358, 77385, 77476, 77494, 97012).\n\nSome research shows that thiamine may improve endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDV) in healthy, prediabetic, and diabetic patients which may in turn prevent cardiovascular complications (77473). Other clinical research shows that taking thiamine 100 mg three times daily for 6 months results in mild decreases in diastolic blood pressure from baseline in normotensive patients with hyperglycemia (91169).\n\nSome research has evaluated the use of thiamine in improving outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The parenteral administration of thiamine before and after surgery does not improve clinical outcomes, lactate levels, or pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) levels in patients with or without low thiamine levels undergoing CABG surgery. However, thiamine administration was associated with increased global oxygen consumption and basal cellular oxygen consumption, although the significance of this finding is unclear (97010).\nInsect repellant\nThere is interest in using thiamine and other B vitamins as a repellent for mosquitos and other insects. The theory is that oral ingestion of thiamine produces an odor detectable by mosquitos that repels them. However, there is no reliable evidence that thiamine works for this use (18016).\nMetabolic effects\nSome experts state that taking thiamine 10-20 mg daily (up to 600-4000 mg daily for Leigh syndrome) might help to temporarily correct metabolic disorders associated with genetic diseases such as subacute necrotizing encephalopathy (SNE, Leigh syndrome), maple syrup urine disease (branched-chain aminoacidopathy), and lactic acidosis associated with pyruvate carboxylase deficiency and hyperalaninemia (15).\nNeurologic effects\nSyndromes associated with thiamine deficiency are beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) (3041, 77830, 77838). WKS is characterized by confusion, aphonia, ataxia, nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, and coma. It's often associated with chronic alcohol use disorder, in which thiamine deficiency occurs due to decreased intake, impaired absorption, and decreased storage of thiamine (11075). Ethanol also decreases the phosphorylation of thiamine, reducing its conversion to the active form (11077).\nRenal effects\nThere is some interest in the use of thiamine to prevent and treat acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to sepsis. Pathophysiologic research has indicated that AKI may be associated with acute hypoxia of the renal cells due to anaerobic metabolism. It is hypothesized that thiamine supplementation may facilitate aerobic metabolism as a cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). In one clinical study, supplementation with thiamine twice daily for 7 days was associated with a reduction in AKI, serum creatinine, and requirement for renal replacement therapy (97009).\nRespiratory effects\nThere is interest in using thiamine to treat mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients, who are often found to have thiamine deficiency. However, preliminary clinical research in mechanically ventilated adults in the intensive care unit shows that a single dose of thiamine 200 mg intravenously does not affect oxygen consumption or serum lactate levels when compared with placebo (107716)."

Thuja extract also reduces oxidative stress by increasing levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione, and reducing activity of inflammatory markers by binding to the active sites of interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta-1 (113414).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, thuja polysaccharides dose-dependently inhibit HIV-1-specific antigen expression and HIV-dependent cell death (1305, 1306, 40888). In vitro, a water extract of thuja leaf has dose-dependent virucidal activity against influenza A virus. It inhibits binding and entry of the virus into cells, inhibits neuraminidase activity, reduces protein and RNA expression, and interferes with hemagglutination. The thuja extract ingredient with the strongest antiviral activity is amentoflavone, but other compounds are thought to act synergistically, including myricetin, quercetin, and quercitrin (113413).\nImmunological effects\nCertain constituents of thuja might have immunostimulant effects. In vitro, thuja polysaccharide g-fraction (TPSg) induces the CD4+ fraction of the human peripheral blood T cell subset and induces production of certain cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (1306, 40892, 40891). In vitro, thuja produces a concentration-dependent increase in the number of antibody-producing lymphocytes. The numbers of anti-sheep red blood cell-IgM-producing plasma cells and other immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells also increase. Other in vitro research shows that thuja can increase nitric oxide production in macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner (40891). However, clinical research in 23 cancer patients shows that a combination product containing thuja does not affect cytokine production (40893).\nIrritant effects\nThuja is reported to have urinary tract irritant and uterine stimulant activity (12).\nNeurologic effects\nThujone, a constituent of thuja, is a neurotoxin that can cause convulsions (1304). It is thought to lower the seizure threshold through inhibition of GABA type A receptors (17078)."

            "Overview": "Thunder god vine is a perennial vine commonly grown in southeast China. Extracts are used in traditional and pharmaceutical Chinese medicine (97677, 97681, 97684, 97686, 97687, 97689, 97692). Traditional uses include inflammation and fever.",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately (4046, 10231, 10674, 10675, 10676, 100825). Thunder god vine extract has been used with apparent safety at doses of up to 120 mg daily for up to 1 year (97678, 97681, 97683, 97684, 97685, 97687, 97688, 97692, 106276, 106277)(112874, 112875, 112876, 112877) or at doses of up to 2 mg/kg daily for up to 5 years (10231, 77923, 112877). ...when thunder god vine tincture is used topically and appropriately, short-term (10233).\nPREGNANCY: LIKELY UNSAFE when used orally. Thunder god vine is thought to be teratogenic (4047); avoid using.\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and topically, thunder god vine is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea, dizziness, gastrointestinal upset, headache, leukopenia, menstrual irregularities, nausea, and skin redness.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Aplastic anemia, hypertension, infertility, kidney damage, liver dysfunction, myelosuppression, and tachyarrhythmias.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, thunder god vine has been associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias (77918) and diastolic hypertension (10676). Swelling of the lower limbs has also been reported (97683).\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, thunder god vine can cause hair loss and skin conditions, such as rash and redness (4046, 10675, 10676, 77931, 97684, 104137). A meta-analysis of Chinese studies found that hair loss and skin reactions were reported in less than 5% of patients taking thunder god vine extract (104137).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, thunder god vine can cause gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (10675, 10676, 77869, 97681, 97682, 97683, 97684, 97686, 97688, 97692, 104137)(106278, 106281, 112877). A meta-analysis of Chinese studies found that gastrointestinal upset was reported in around 14% of patients taking thunder god vine extract (104137). However, when compared to standard treatments for kidney disease, a meta-analysis shows that the probability of gastrointestinal adverse events was lower in patients taking thunder god vine (106278).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, thunder god vine has been reported to cause menstrual changes and amenorrhea (4046, 10675, 10676, 11009, 97681, 97682, 97683, 104137, 112874). A meta-analysis of Chinese studies found that amenorrhea was reported in around 10% of females taking thunder god vine extract (104137).\n\nThunder god vine has also been reported to induce infertility in males (10230, 77947). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking thunder god vine reduces sperm concentration, motility, and motility grade when compared with baseline. Normalization of sperm function seems to return six weeks after discontinuation of treatment (11133). Also, in one trial, erectile dysfunction occurred in one patient, which improved with a dose reduction from 1.5 mg/kg daily to 1 mg/kg daily (106281).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, hyperkalemia has occurred in patients with diabetes taking thunder god vine (97685). However, it is unclear whether this was related to the thunder god vine, diabetes, or conventional medications. Deaths related to aplastic anemia associated with the use of non-standardized forms of thunder god vine have been reported (97684). A case of severe myelosuppression, lung infection, sepsis, and septic shock is reported in a 50-year-old female with stage 5 chronic kidney disease after taking a decoction providing thunder god vine 12 grams daily for 11 days. Despite discontinuing the product and receiving intensive medical treatment, the patient died (112872).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, thunder god vine has been reported to cause transient elevations of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in up to 9% of study participants (77869, 97678, 97682, 97683, 97684, 97685, 97686, 97688, 97691, 104137)(106278, 106281). However, in one study, elevations in ALT resulting in levels up to two times the upper limit of normal occurred in approximately 47% of participants with SAPHO syndrome. Only one patient had a severe elevation defined as more than three times the upper limit of normal (106281). Deaths related to severe liver dysfunction associated with the use of non-standardized forms of thunder god vine have been reported (97684).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, thunder god vine has been reported to cause leukopenia in up to 6% of study participants (97684, 97685, 97686, 97688, 97691, 97692, 104137, 106278). Deaths related to leukopenia associated with the use of non-standardized forms of thunder god vine have been reported (97684).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, thunder god vine use for 5 or more years has been reported to cause decreased bone mineral content in females (10231).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, thunder god vine can cause dizziness and headache (10675, 106278).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, thunder god vine has been reported to cause kidney damage (77934). In a meta-analysis of 1555 cases involving treatment with thunder god vine preparations, 78 patients, or about 6%, experienced nephrotoxicity. However, due to various limitations, this risk might have been an overestimation (100823). A meta-analysis of Chinese studies found that proteinuria was reported in 13.5% of patients taking thunder god vine extract, while 6% to 8% of patients had elevated serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen levels (104137).\n\nThere are three case reports of acute renal injury due to honey contaminated with thunder god pollen. The pollen contains the compound triptolide, which is excreted in the kidneys. Two of the three adults recovered, whereas the third died of acute kidney failure with toxic myocarditis (97680).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCrohn disease. Oral thunder god vine seems to prevent relapse of Crohn disease in patients who are in remission.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with Crohn disease shows that taking thunder god vine 1 mg/kg daily for 52 weeks reduces the rate of clinical and endoscopic recurrence after surgery-induced remission by an additional 4.5- or 2.5-fold, respectively, when compared with mesalamine 4 grams daily (97686). When compared with azathioprine 2 mg/kg daily, taking thunder god vine 1.5 mg/kg daily for 52 weeks is as effective for preventing clinical recurrence after surgery, but is less effective for preventing endoscopic recurrence (97692). Furthermore, taking thunder god vine 2 mg/kg daily for 52 weeks is approximately 3-fold more effective than mesalamine 3 grams daily for preventing clinical recurrence following medication-induced remission. Thunder god vine 1 mg/kg daily appears to be as effective as mesalamine (97691).\nless\nGraves' ophthalmopathy. Oral thunder god vine in combination with conventional therapy seems to improve symptoms of Graves' ophthalmopathy.\nA meta-analysis of 19 low-quality clinical studies in patients in China with Graves' ophthalmopathy shows that taking thunder god vine extract 15-600 mg or 1-1.5 mg/kg daily along with conventional therapy for 3-4 months improves ocular symptoms and reduces the degree of exophthalmos when compared with conventional therapy alone. The most common doses of the extract are 30-60 mg daily or 1 mg/kg daily for 3-4 months (104136).\nless\nIgA nephropathy. Oral thunder god vine seems to increase the number of patients in remission from IgA nephropathy.\nA meta-analysis of small to moderate-sized clinical trials in patients with IgA nephropathy shows that taking thunder god vine daily, with or without conventional treatment for 3-12 months, improves total and complete remission rates based on 16 and 17 studies, respectively, when compared with conventional treatment alone. Thunder god vine may also reduce 24-hour proteinuria (112873). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by the lack of information on the dosing of thunder god vine. An earlier meta-analysis of 4 clinical studies in adults with IgA nephropathy shows that taking thunder god vine 1-1.5 mg/kg or 60 mg daily for 6 months, alone or with other medications, increases the complete and total remission rate by 53% and 27%, respectively, when compared with taking prednisone or other treatments without thunder god vine (97688). An additional meta-analysis of small clinical studies shows that taking thunder god vine reduces 24-hour proteinuria by 0.6 grams daily when compared with placebo or conventional medicine (97689). This effect may be dose-dependent. In one study, taking thunder god vine 2 mg/kg daily for 6-8 weeks before reducing to 1 mg/kg daily as maintenance resulted in complete remission in 88% of patients, compared with no remission in patients taking thunder god vine 1 mg/kg daily (97678).\nless\nLichen planus. Oral thunder god vine in combination with conventional therapy seems to improve symptoms and prevent recurrence of lichen planus.\nA meta-analysis of 18 low-quality clinical studies in patients in China with oral lichen planus shows that taking thunder god vine extract along with conventional therapy for 1-12 weeks reduces pain, resolves sores, and reduces the risk for recurrence by 63% when compared with conventional therapy alone (104138).\nless\nNephrotic syndrome. Oral thunder god vine, taken alone or in combination with conventional therapy, seems to improve symptoms and prevent recurrence of nephrotic syndrome.\nMost clinical research shows that taking thunder god vine 0.5-2 mg/kg daily for 4-8 weeks is beneficial for primary nephrotic syndrome in adults and children (10677, 97677, 97684). A meta-analysis of mainly preliminary clinical research shows that taking thunder god vine increases the odds of total or complete remission by 4.8- or 6.3-fold, respectively, when compared with prednisone (97677). Furthermore, the combination of thunder god vine and prednisone increases the odds of remission by 2.1-fold when compared with prednisone alone (97677). Another meta-analysis of mainly preliminary clinical research shows that taking thunder god vine polyglycosides alone or with routine treatments increases the odds of complete or partial remission by 2.8- to 4.1-fold when compared with routine treatments alone (106278). Meta-analyses also show that taking thunder god vine reduces 24-hour proteinuria and serum creatinine levels, and increases serum albumin levels, when compared with placebo or conventional medicine (97689, 106278). One meta-analysis suggests that the reduction in urinary protein over 24 hours is 0.7 grams daily (97689).\n\nIn patients with nephrotic syndrome due to idiopathic membranous nephropathy, observational research has found that taking thunder god vine 40-60 mg daily with prednisone, prednisolone, or tacrolimus for up to 9 months seems to be as effective as tacrolimus with prednisone or prednisolone for achieving partial and complete remission (97681, 100827).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral thunder god vine, used alone or in combination with conventional therapy, seems to improve symptoms of RA. It is unclear if topical thunder god vine is beneficial for RA.\nOral thunder god vine has been evaluated as monotherapy and in conjunction with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A meta-analysis of up to 40 moderate to high quality, small to moderate-sized clinical trials in adults with RA shows that taking thunder god vine glycosides, usually 30-60 mg daily in 3-4 divided doses for 12 or 24 weeks in combination with methotrexate or leflunomide, reduces the duration of morning stiffness, the tender or swollen joint count, overall pain, and inflammatory factors, and improves the total clinical effective rate, when compared with standard treatments alone (106276). Likewise, 2 similar meta-analyses of mostly small to moderate-sized clinical trials in adults with RA shows that taking thunder god vine 10-60 mg daily with methotrexate treatment for 12-24 weeks improves remission rates, tender and swollen joint counts, and morning stiffness when compared with methotrexate alone (97690, 112874). Additionally, a large clinical trial in adults with moderate to severe RA shows that taking thunder god vine 20 mg 3 times daily in combination with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor for 24 weeks improves disease activity and reduces tender and swollen joint counts when compared with taking thunder god alone, methotrexate alone, or taking methotrexate with the TNF inhibitor (112875).\n\nA network meta-analysis of 21 mostly moderate quality clinical studies in patients with RA, including 5 moderate to large-sized clinical trials evaluating oral thunder god vine, dose not described, alone or in combination with methotrexate or leflunomide for 12-24 weeks, suggests that taking thunder god vine in combination with methotrexate is the most likely option to provide a 20% improvement in tender and swollen joints and other symptoms followed by thunder god vine monotherapy ranked second. Taking thunder god vine with methotrexate was ranked second most likely to provide a 50% or 70% improvement, with the combination of cyclosporine and leflunomide ranked the most likely (110519). A similar, earlier network meta-analysis shows that taking thunder god vine alone is most likely to result in an additional 20% to 70% improvement in tender and swollen joints when compared indirectly with leflunomide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, or sulfasalazine (97679).\n\nClinical research shows that applying a tincture of thunder god vine topically over affected joints decreases joint tenderness, stiffness, and swelling when compared with placebo (10233).\n\nMost clinical studies were conducted in China; it is unclear if the effects of thunder god vine are generalizable to other geographic regions.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAnkylosing spondylitis. Oral thunder god vine does not seem to improve symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis.\nAlthough some preliminary clinical research in adults with ankylosing spondylitis shows that taking thunder god vine improves pain and function when compared to baseline (97687), a meta-analysis of 11 moderate-quality randomized controlled trials disagrees with these findings and suggests that taking thunder god vine glycosides is no more effective than control for improving symptoms such as morning stiffness, swelling, or pain. Control treatments included various Chinese herbal compounds or sulfasalazine. Also, when taken in combination with leflunomide in one trial, thunder god vine was no more effective than leflunomide alone (106280). The most common doses used are 30-60 mg daily in divided doses for 4-12 weeks (97687, 106280).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral thunder god vine is beneficial for eczema.\nA meta-analysis of mainly preliminary clinical research shows that taking thunder god vine preparations in combination with topical glucocorticoids, glycyrrhizin, or other natural medicine preparations further improves symptoms of eczema when compared with glucocorticoids or natural agents alone (100824). This analysis is limited by the variability of the combination treatments; it is unclear which treatment might have caused a beneficial effect.\nless\nBehcet disease. Although there is interest in using oral thunder god vine for Behcet disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of thunder god vine for this condition.\nCancer. Although there is interest in using oral thunder god vine for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of thunder god vine for this condition.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral thunder god vine is beneficial for chronic glomerulonephritis of various causes.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis of various causes shows that taking thunder god vine polyglycosides 20 mg three times daily for 2 months in combination with irbesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, and dipyridamole modestly improves serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and proteinuria when compared with the medication regimen alone. There were also modest improvements in levels of inflammatory mediators, suggesting improved immune function (106277). Additionally, one meta-analysis shows that taking thunder dog vine reduces urinary protein by 0.25 grams over 24 hours in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (97689).\nless\nConnective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CT-ILD). Some small clinical studies suggest that oral thunder god vine may be beneficial for CT-ILD.\nA meta-analysis of a small number of preliminary clinical trials shows that taking thunder god vine for 6-12 months in combination with conventional therapy including glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressants modestly improves lung function and lung volume when compared with conventional therapy alone. There were also some modest beneficial effects on symptoms, specifically cough, shortness of breath, and Velcro crackles, but not dyspnea (106279).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral thunder god vine may be beneficial for diabetic nephropathy.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy of unclear severity shows that taking thunder god vine 40 mg three times daily for 3 months, followed by 20 mg three times daily for 3 months, reduces urinary protein levels by 33% to 39%, but does not affect glomerular filtration, when compared with taking valsartan 160 mg daily. Increases in serum creatinine of at least 25% occurred in approximately 60% fewer patients taking thunder god vine (97685). Thunder god vine has also been investigated in patients with end-stage diabetic nephropathy. A meta-analysis of mainly preliminary clinical studies in these patients shows that adding thunder god vine preparations to conventional treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces 24-hour urinary protein and increases serum albumin, but does not affect serum creatinine, when compared with conventional therapy alone (100826). Additionally, meta-analyses of small to moderate-sized, low-quality clinical studies in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that lower dose thunder god vine, under 1 mg/kg or 60 mg daily for 6 months, taken in conjunction with conventional treatment, reduces 24-hour urinary protein and serum creatinine and increases serum albumin based on 21, 18, and 13 studies, respectively, when compared with conventional treatment alone (112876). All clinical studies were conducted in China; it is unclear if the effects of thunder god vine are generalizable to other geographic regions.\nless\nHIV/AIDS. Although there is interest in using oral thunder god vine for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of thunder god vine for this condition.\nKidney transplant. It is unclear if oral thunder god vine is beneficial for improving survival after a kidney transplant.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking thunder god vine, 1-2 mg/kg daily beginning 7-14 days prior to transplantation and continuing for 5 years thereafter, reduces rejection rate and improves survival when compared to an untreated control group (77923). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking thunder god vine, cyclosporine, and prednisone normalizes graft function approximately 7.3 days faster, and modestly improves 1-2 year graft survival rates, when compared with taking azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone (77944).\nless\nMembranous nephropathy. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral thunder god vine may be beneficial for membranous nephropathy, particularly when used in conjunction with conventional therapy.\nA meta-analysis of 3 small to moderate-sized clinical trials in adults with membranous nephropathy shows that taking thunder god vine 1-1.5 mg/kg daily for 3-6 months increases the odds of complete or partial remission by 4.8-fold and reduces 24-hour urinary protein levels when compared with conventional treatments. (106278). A network meta-analysis of up to 29 small to large clinical trials in adults with idiopathic membranous nephropathy shows that taking thunder god vine 1-2 mg/kg daily or 20-40 mg 3 times daily for 2-6 months then tapering to 20-60 mg daily for up to a year in conjunction with conventional treatments such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants improves total remission rates and reduces 24-hour urinary protein when compared with conventional treatment alone (112877). Additionally, in patients with nephrotic syndrome due to idiopathic membranous nephropathy, observational research has found that taking thunder god vine 40-60 mg daily with prednisone, prednisolone, or tacrolimus for up to 9 months seems to be as effective as tacrolimus with prednisone or prednisolone for achieving partial and complete remission (97681, 100827). The majority of the studies were conducted in China; it is unclear if findings are generalizable to other geographic regions.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Although there is interest in using oral thunder god vine for MS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of thunder god vine for this condition.\nPsoriasis. It is unclear if oral thunder god vine is beneficial for psoriasis.\nA small clinical study in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis shows that taking thunder god vine 20 mg three times daily for 8 weeks is as effective as acitretin 30 mg daily for reducing overall symptoms (97683). The validity of these findings is limited by the short-term treatment and the lack of a placebo group. Another small clinical study in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis shows that taking thunder god vine and acitretin for 8 weeks improves clinician-assessed psoriasis severity scores when compared with acitretin and licorice extract or acitretin alone. Doses of thunder god vine, acitretin, and licorice extract were not provided (110520). The validity of these findings is limited by the short-term treatment, lack of blinding, and lack of a placebo group.\nless\nSAPHO syndrome. It is unclear if oral thunder god vine is beneficial for SAPHO syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with SAPHO syndrome using only anti-inflammatory agents as needed shows that taking thunder god vine glycosides modestly improves osteoarticular pain and overall measures of disease activity within 2-4 weeks when compared with baseline. Patients received either 1 mg/kg for 12 weeks or 1.5 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks followed by 1 mg/kg daily over the next 8 weeks (106281). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis. It is unclear if oral thunder god vine is beneficial for SLE nephritis.\nThere is preliminary evidence that thunder god vine may be beneficial for nephritis associated with SLE (97689). However, taking thunder god vine in addition to prednisone does not appear to reduce symptoms better than prednisone alone (77934).\nless\nUrticaria. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral thunder god vine may be beneficial for urticaria.\nA meta-analysis of mostly preliminary clinical research shows that adding thunder god vine preparations to antihistamines improves symptoms of chronic urticaria when compared with antihistamines alone (100825).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate thunder god vine for these uses.",

The patient developed severe gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as leukopenia, hypotension, tachyarrhythmias, cardiac damage, kidney failure, and hypovolemic shock and died within 15 hours of presentation to the hospital (8658).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with thunder god vine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOral consumption of thunder god vine results in increased plasma levels of the constituents triptolide, wilforlide A, and triptonide (77924). Triptolide is highly absorbed when taken orally (100828).\nDistribution\nThe thunder god vine constituent, triptolide, distributes into the liver, kidney, heart, spleen, and lungs (100828).\nMetabolism\nIn animal research, the thunder god vine constituent, triptolide, is extensively metabolized via hydroxylation. Triptolide metabolites are further metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, N-acetyltransferases, sulfotransferases, and glutathione S-transferases (100828).\nExcretion\nIn animal rat models, triptolide has a 0.42-hour half-life after oral administration (100828).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of thunder god vine are the leaf and root. The active constituents of thunder god vine are terpenoids. Many di- and tri-terpenoids have been identified including tripchlorolide, triptolidenol, triptolide, tripdiolide, triptonide, 16-hydroxytriptolide, and wilforlides (840, 10230, 97679, 97682).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nThunder god vine is traditionally used for rheumatoid arthritis. In vitro, thunder god vine inhibits the production of nitric oxide by chondrocytes, the cells in the joint (77879). Constituents from thunder god vine inhibit the production of prostaglandin E2 from synovial cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients (77945) and inhibit the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts (77892). Some constituents inhibit the inflammatory messaging within chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts (77907). In clinical trials, oral thunder god vine reduces levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, suggesting a reduction of joint inflammation (97682, 97687, 97690, 112874).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThunder god vine is of interest for cancer. In vitro, thunder god vine or its constituents induce the apoptosis of cancer cells and suppress cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In animal research, thunder god vine inhibits the growth of tumors (77886, 77959, 97689).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThunder god vine has anti-inflammatory effects. An extract of the root of thunder god vine exerts anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2 and 5-lipoxygenase (12480). Thunder god extracts, and various constituents such as tripterine and triptolide, inhibit cellular processes involved in inflammation (11130, 12480, 77871, 77911, 77922, 77946). Additionally, clinical research shows thunder god vine lowers levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and rheumatoid factor (97682, 97687, 97690, 112874).\nAntiviral effects\nThe neotripterifordin, tripterifordin, and salaspermic acid constituents of thunder god vine exhibit potent anti-HIV replication activity in vitro (4048, 4049, 77954). Other constituents demonstrate antiviral effects against herpes simplex-1 virus, human cytomegalovirus, measles virus, Epstein-Barr, and influenza A (77936, 77956).\nFertility effects\nThunder god vine leaf and root demonstrate antifertility effects in males by inhibiting sperm transformation, maturation, and mobility. Triptolide, tripdiolide, and possibly other compounds seem to be responsible for this effect (11130, 11131). Male fertility appears to return to normal six weeks after discontinuation (4046, 11133).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThunder god vine is traditionally used for Crohn disease. The constituent triptolide inhibits intestinal inflammation in animal models by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine processes (97691). Triptolide also reduces intestinal permeability by inhibiting actions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (97691).\nImmunosuppressive effects\nThunder god vine has immunosuppressive effects. The immunosuppressive effects of thunder god vine are attributed to the constituent triptolide. Triptolide inhibits lymphocyte activation and T-cell expression of interleukin-2 (5305, 11132). In vitro, various constituents in thunder god vine inhibit the production of cytokines involved in the immune response (1442, 10674, 77948, 77953). An alcoholic extract, known as T2, that contains triptolide and tripdiolide, inhibits T-cell and B-cell proliferation, as well as immunoglobulin production by B-cells (1442). T2 also inhibits the release of prostaglandin 2 (PGE 2) from mononuclear leukocytes (5305). A water extract of thunder god vine inhibits the activity of cellular adhesion molecules of leukocytes and endothelial cells, including integrins and selectins (1206, 8409).\nNephroprotective effects\nThunder god vine is traditionally used for kidney disease. In isolated glomeruli, the extract protects the filtration barriers. It also demonstrates anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in kidney cells (97684). A meta-analysis of studies in mice and rats with diabetic kidney disease suggests that thunder god vine reduces albuminuria and serum creatinine when compared with no treatment but does not improve these outcomes when compared with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (110517). Additionally, meta-analyses of clinical trials in patients with IgA nephropathy and in patients with diabetic nephropathy show that taking thunder god vine daily with or without conventional treatment increases serum albumin and decreases serum creatinine when compared with conventional treatment alone (112873, 112876).\nRespiratory effects\nClinical research shows that thunder god vine might be beneficial for lung function in patients with interstitial lung disease. In animal research, the beneficial effect on pulmonary epithelial cells was related to the regulation of immune and/or inflammatory regulatory factors (106279).\nToxic effects\nThunder god vine contains constituents that can have toxic effects in animals and humans. Constituents have been shown to induce apoptosis of mitochondria and heart muscle cells, and to promote inflammation or oxidative stress (97689). Thunder god vine extracts can inhibit growth factor response in CD34+ bone marrow cells (77867)."

The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if this effect is due to thyme, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nBronchitis. Oral thyme has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nSome research has evaluated thyme in combination with cowslip. One observational study in adults and children has found that taking a specific product (Bronchipret) containing thyme and cowslip relieves symptoms of bronchitis and increases production of sputum (13557). A clinical study in patients with acute bronchitis shows that taking a similar combination extract (Bronchicum Tropfen) containing thyme and cowslip root 1 mL five times daily for 7-9 days seems to reduce severity and duration of coughing when compared with placebo (49219). Other thyme and cowslip preparations such as Bronchicum Elixir S and Bronchcium Tropfen seem to be similarly beneficial for bronchitis (49223).\n\nThyme has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. A large clinical study in patients with acute bronchitis shows that taking a specific syrup (Bronchipret Saft, Bionorica AG) containing thyme and English ivy leaf 5.4 mL three times daily for 11 days reduces the frequency and duration of cough when compared with placebo (78152). Additionally, an observational study in children with acute bronchitis has found that taking this combination product in an age-specific dosing schema is associated with reduced bronchitis severity and coughing fits when compared to baseline (78181).

Environmental conditions including soil composition, the season, time of day and the way the plant was harvested, in addition to how the plant is stored and subsequently processed can affect the essential oil composition. Lastly, how the oil is extracted and subsequently analyzed can also affect the composition of the essential oils (94035, 94036, 94037).\n\nThe European Pharmacopeia 5.0, states that the minimum content of essential oil in thyme is 12 mL/kg (94037).",

Thyme contains thymol 30% to 70%, carvacrol 3% to 15%, and several other constituents including borneol, geraniol, linalool, and alpha-pinene. It also contains flavonoids such as apigenin and luteolin, polyphenolic acids such as caffeic acid, triterpene acids such as ursolic and rosmaric acid, as well as terpinene, tannins, saponins and other constituents (13448, 13463).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro research shows that thyme extract might have anti-inflammatory activity. This effect is attributed to the ability of thyme to scavenge nitric oxide radicals (13458).\nAntimicrobial effects\nPreliminary research suggests that thyme has antimicrobial activity and modest antibacterial effects (13450, 13451). It also seems to have antiviral activity against influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus (13449). Other preliminary research suggests thyme has activity against fungi such as Candida albicans and other Candida species. It seems to potentiate the antifungal activity of amphotericin B (13452, 13453). Thymol is active against fungal microorganisms that cause onychomycosis such as Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Epidermophyton stockdale (13447).\nAntioxidant effects\nThyme and its constituents thymol and carvacrol might have antioxidant effects and DNA protective effects (13450, 13454, 13455).

In an animal model, thyme seems to induce the phase I enzyme 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECOD) enzyme. Thyme also seems to induce the phase II enzymes glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and quinine reductase (QR). Thymol and carvacrol are thought to be responsible for these effects (13164).\nInsect repellant effects\nPreliminary research suggests the thyme constituent, alpha-terpinene, might be an effective mosquito repellent (13462).\nSkin aging effects\nThere is interest in using thyme extract for reducing wrinkles in aging skin. In vitro, thyme flower and leaf extract increased adiponectin and stimulated the adipogenesis process, which may lead to increased conversion of fibroblast-like precursor cells into lipid-laden adipocytes. These adipocytes are thought to function like skin fillers to reduce wrinkles (105909).\nWound healing effects\nThyme oil might improve the healing of burn wounds by promoting the formation of new tissue (13461)."

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of thymus extract.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThymus extract is derived from bovine thymus glands. The thymus is a lobular gland located under the breastbone near the thyroid gland that is responsible for the production of T-lymphocytes and various hormones, including thymosin, thymomodulin, thymulin, thymic humoral factor, hormonal thymic factor, and serum thymic factor (6614).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn humans, nonathymulin, a synthetic thymic peptide hormone, improved global assessment and objective parameters related to arthritis (78482). In an animal model, synthetic thymic peptides reduced joint swelling and synovitis (78551). The exact mechanism of action is not well understood.\nAnticancer effects\nCalf thymus extract contains two natural killer cytotoxicity-stimulating factors, CSFa and CSFb, which reduce tumor development in mice (78491). In animal models, thymic factors reduced tumor metastases (78427, 78575). Also, postnatal administration of thymus factor in a tumor-bearing rat model increased lifespan and decreased tumor quantity (78559). In vitro, thymic peptides increased IL-2 activated killer cell activity (78576).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn humans treated with interferon-alpha, treatment with thymomodulin (calf thymus extract) significantly increased serum antioxidant capacity (78442). In vitro, thymic peptide increased glutathione levels and glutathione disulfide reductase activity and inhibited the negative oxidative effects of oxidants (78538, 78547, 78553).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nThe thymus is involved in human immune function. There is interest in using thymus extract for various immunomodulatory effects. In clinical research and in vitro, calf thymus extract (thymomodulin) and thymostimulin have been shown to increase T- and B-lymphocyte counts, the number of rosette-forming cells, and the response of T-lymphocytes (78524, 78522, 78445, 78434, 78526, 78528, 78487, 78462, 78481, 78550)(6678, 78472, 78571, 78540, 6685, 78509, 78513, 78476, 78526, 78527)(78524, 78522, 78445, 78434, 78528, 78550, 6678, 78532, 78549, 78451)(78519, 78493, 78574, 6689).\n\nIn vitro research shows that a thymic derivative enhances the functions of mature T-lymphocytes with cascading effects on B-cell and macrophage functions (6689). Also, thymomodulin regulates the maturation of human and murine pre-T lymphocytes and the function of mature human and animal B and T lymphocytes (78485, 6689, 78472). Synthetic thymic hormone T alpha 1 may influence T-cell production and maturation and activate natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (78441). It is also thought that immunosuppressive effects of p15-like factors can be neutralized by thymic peptides (78554). Thymus extract has been shown to stimulate production of interleukin-2 (78475) and T helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses (78555, 78441, 78546). In animal models, as well as in cells isolated from human subjects, thymic peptide upregulated counts and/or activity of peripheral blood cells (78427, 78578, 78424).\n\nIn humans, thymus extract increased spontaneous fluorescence of neutrophils, an indicator of increased neutrophil activity (78439, 78442). In patients with breast cancer, addition of thymostimulin to myelosuppressive chemotherapy enhanced hematological recovery, including increased neutrophil count (78557). In cancer patients, t-activin significantly increased the number of natural killer cells (CD16+) (78561). In patients with recurrent respiratory infections, thymomodulin increased the T4+/T8+ ratio (1177).\n\nNon-human studies indicate the potential for thymomodulin and other thymus extracts to increase bone marrow production and functional activity of white blood cells (78543). In both mice and humans, thymus extract stimulates myelopoiesis (78527). Thymomodulin can promote myelopoiesis as demonstrated by an increase of granulocyte-macrophage colonies in agar (78485). The use of calf thymus extract facilitated chemotherapy by stimulation of myelopoiesis (78447). In humans, thymomodulin may increase the low colony formation, as well as stimulate colony-stimulating factor (CSF) production by human leukocytes, presumably by influencing the interactions between monocytes and lymphocytes (78527).\n\nThymomodulin might also affect immune globulin (Ig) activity. In children with food allergies, thymomodulin significantly decreased total and specific IgE serum levels (1175). In patients with recurrent respiratory infections, thymomodulin significantly increased levels of salivary IgA (6697). In exercising individuals, thymomodulin had a protective effect on the decrease in the IgG2 subclass (78532).\n\nIn humans with immune deficiencies, thymic peptide increased secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-8 (78563), and enhanced cell-mediated immune reaction to recall antigens (78577). Thymomodulin also increased cell-mediated immunity and possibly restored the immune capability of patients (78573).\nLipid effects\nIn animal model, a calf thymus protein inhibited HMG-CoA reductase activity (78436).\nThyroid effects\nIn animals, purified thymus gland extract administered intramuscularly reduced serum T4 levels in rats, but did not significantly decrease average thyroid gland weights or serum T3 levels (78514)."

            "Overview": "Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant that is available as a prescription medication in some European, Asian, and Latin American countries. It is not approved for use as a medication by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but is sold as a research chemical. Tianeptine is on the FDA Advisory List of ingredients that do not qualify for dietary use. It is sold as a dietary supplement by companies in China, Mexico, and India (100786, 100793, 115889). Tianeptine has been associated with cases of abuse, withdrawal, and serious adverse effects including death (100786, 100789, 100790, 100796, 100806, 115889).",

Although tianeptine is approved as a prescription drug in certain countries and has been used during pregnancy under the guidance of a healthcare provider when medically necessary (100831), its use is discouraged. Tianeptine use can lead to neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), especially when used recreationally, throughout pregnancy. In case reports, babies born to mothers taking high doses of tianeptine (e.g. 650 mg or more daily) during pregnancy presented with NAS. Symptoms included diarrhea, fever, frequent yawning and sneezing, global hypertonia, high-pitched crying, jitteriness, poor feeding, sweating, undisturbed tremors, vomiting, and weak or excessive sucking. This tianeptine-induced NAS mimicked opiate-induced NAS and was treated successfully with morphine (100787, 116139).\nLACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the use tianeptine during lactation.

It has been shown to increase the rate of serotonin re-uptake, which is thought to enhance serotonin concentrations in the synapse. Tianeptine has opioid activity at higher doses (100796, 100802, 100804).\nAnalgesic effects\nIn animal research, tianeptine's analgesic properties are mediated by mu-opioid receptors (116140).\nCentral nervous system effects\nTianeptine is thought to work for depression by increasing neuroplasticity. It seems to increase spontaneous activity of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, accelerate their recovery, and increase the rate of serotonin re-uptake (100796, 100804). At higher doses, tianeptine is an atypical mu-opioid receptor agonist, which may contribute to its antidepressant effects. Its primary metabolite, MC5, seems to have similar effects in animal research (100789, 100802, 100804, 106880).\n\nLower doses do not seem to have opioid effects. In healthy patients, taking a lower dose (12.5 mg) of tianeptine by mouth reduces plasma noradrenaline and serotonin levels and increases plasma dopamine and platelet serotonin levels over 4 hours. It does not seem to affect adrenaline, heart rate, or systolic blood pressure (100798).\nNeuropathic pain effects\nAnimal research shows that tianeptine and pregabalin have additive analgesic effects in a rat model of neuropathic pain. When administered concomitantly, tianeptine and pregabalin reduce pain at doses lower than each drug administered alone (111546).\nOpioid-like effects\nAnimal research shows that tianeptine is a mu-opioid receptor agonist with opioid-like adverse effects including motor impairment, constipation, and respiratory depression which can be blocked by pre-treatment with naltrexone. However, there is a notable lack of increasing tolerance and dependence in animals administered tianeptine at increasing doses, suggesting lower abuse potential with tianeptine compared with other opioids (111547).\n\nThere has been some interest in using tianeptine to reverse the respiratory depressant effects of other opioids. This is based on laboratory research showing that tianeptine modulates AMPA receptors which are involved in respiratory drive. However, clinical research shows that tianeptine actually worsens opioid-induced respiratory depression. Researchers theorize that this is due to the mu-opioid receptor agonist effects of tianeptine overriding its potential respiratory stimulating effects (111550).\nRespiratory effects\nThere is interest in using tianeptine for asthma because it reduces free serotonin levels. Patients with symptomatic asthma have higher levels of free serotonin in the blood compared to asymptomatic patients, and the level appears to correlate with asthma severity (100832)."

Dentifrices containing various forms of tin have shown some benefit for improving symptoms of gingivitis; most research has evaluated the use of stannous fluoride.\nMost research shows that dentifrices containing tin as stannous fluoride reduce gingivitis by a small but clinically meaningful amount. One meta-analysis of clinical research shows that stannous fluoride dentifrices modestly reduce gingivitis when compared with placebo or vehicle control when evaluated using the gingival index or modified gingival index (87068). A clinical study in healthy adults with gingivitis shows that a dentifrice containing stannous fluoride 0.454% and stabilized with zinc phosphate (Colgate Total, Colgate-Palmolive Company), applied twice daily for 6 months, reduces gingival inflammation when compared with baseline. However, the validity of these findings is limited by a lack of statistical comparison to sodium monofluorophosphate (106017). Another meta-analysis of 13 trials shows that using a dentifrice containing stannous fluoride is at least as effective as a dentifrice containing triclosan for reducing symptoms of gingivitis, including gingival bleeding (94409). Also, a clinical study in patients with mild to moderate gingivitis shows that a specific stannous fluoride dentifrice (Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection, Proctor & Gamble) reduces the number of gingival bleeding sites by 74% after 3 months when compared to baseline; this improvement is significant when compared with a control fluoride dentifrice (98566).\n\nResearch on the use of other forms of tin has also shown benefit. One large meta-analysis of clinical research shows that gluconate chelated stannous fluoride 0.454% dentifrices applied for up to 3 months improve the average number of bleeding sites by 51% when compared with sodium fluoride or sodium monofluorophosphate dentifrice and 31% when compared with triclosan, regardless of baseline disease severity (106014). Another clinical study in healthy adults with gingivitis shows that an amine fluoride dentifrice containing stannous chloride applied twice daily for 12 weeks reduces gingivitis and gingival bleeding when compared with baseline. Stannous chloride seems to be slightly more effective than sodium monofluorophosphate for reducing gingivitis at 12 weeks (101106).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDental hypersensitivity. Most research shows that tin is beneficial for reducing dental hypersensitivity, although it may not be as effective as other ingredients.\nTwo meta-analyses of clinical research show that topical application of gel or dentifrice containing tin in the form of stannous fluoride 0.4% for up to 8 weeks improves dental hypersensitivity when compared with placebo (28649, 98560). However, it seems to take about 2 weeks before improvements occur. This is in contrast to topical fluoride solution 0.717%, which relieves hypersensitivity in approximately 3-5 minutes (28649, 98562). Another clinical study in healthy adults with dental hypersensitivity shows that a dentifrice containing anhydrous stannous fluoride 0.454% with sodium fluoride 0.072% applied twice daily for 8 weeks improves sensitivity and tactile threshold scores when compared with baseline. However, stannous fluoride is less effective than sodium monofluorophosphate for improving sensitivity scores (106015).\n\nTin has also been evaluated in endurance athletes, who are at increased risk for dental erosion. A small clinical study shows that a once daily oral hygiene regimen providing stannous fluoride in both a mouth rinse and chitosan-containing dentifrice improves dental erosion in endurance athletes after about 2 years of use when compared with a fluoridated dentifrice. However, dental hypersensitivity and saliva pH were unaffected (106016).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDental plaque. Overall, using a dentifrice containing tin in the form of stannous fluoride seems to modestly reduce plaque; however, the improvement might not be clinically meaningful.\nOne analysis of clinical research shows that using dentifrices with stannous fluoride reduces plaque by only a small amount when compared with placebo or vehicle control (87068). When compared to other active dentifrices, results from clinical research are conflicting. Some research shows that stannous fluoride dentifrices reduce plaque by a moderate amount when compared with sodium fluoride dentifrices when measured using the Turesky modification of the Quigley & Hein index, but not when measured by the plaque index (28648). A clinical study in healthy adults with gingivitis shows that a dentifrice containing stannous fluoride 0.454% and stabilized with zinc phosphate (Colgate Total, Colgate-Palmolive Company), applied twice daily for 6 months, reduces plaque when compared with baseline. However, the validity of these findings is limited by a lack of statistical comparison to sodium monofluorophosphate (106017). Additional research shows that stannous fluoride dentifrices reduce plaque similarly to triclosan dentifrices according to the Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index. However, when measured using the Turesky modification of the Quigly-Hein Plaque Index, triclosan dentifrices seem to reduce plaque more than stannous fluoride (94409).\n\nA clinical study in healthy adults with gingivitis shows that an amine fluoride dentifrice containing stannous chloride applied twice daily for 12 weeks is 33% more effective than a sodium monofluorophosphate dentifrice for reducing dental plaque, as measured by the plaque index, when compared with baseline (101106).\nless\nDry mouth.

In animals, the thymus is found to contain higher levels of tin (28673). Methylated metals, such as methyl tin, show increased mobility, more efficient transport in the body, and increased potential for passing through barriers such as the placental and blood-brain barriers (28674).\nExcretion\nInorganic tin salts that are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract are rapidly excreted in the feces (28637).",

It exists as a pure metallic compound or as part of inorganic and organic compounds (28641).\nAntibacterial effects\nThe antibacterial effects of tin in the form of stannous fluoride are thought to be partially due to a block of selenium metabolism in the bacterial pathogen (28668). In human research, use of a dentifrice and mouthwash containing both amine fluoride and stannous fluoride resulted in a trend toward reduced amounts of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus in saliva when compared with dentifrice and mouthwash containing sodium fluoride (28669). Anhydrous preparations of stannous fluoride appear to result in a stable, uncomplexed form of the tin ion with antibacterial activity and the ability to be deposited onto surfaces reducing plaque formation (28670). In aqueous preparations, however, the tin ion is stabilized using strong complexing ions resulting in a reduced ability for deposition on to surfaces and reduced antibacterial effects.\nDental mineralizing effects\nTin in the form of stannous fluoride promotes remineralization of partially demineralized tooth enamel. It reduces erosion by increasing resistance of enamel to an acid attack and then reacting with the enamel to form a protective tin fluorophosphate coating on the tooth surface (28666, 28671, 28672, 98559). This protection seems to last for hours after treatment (98559).\nDentin-desensitizing effects\nAnhydrous preparations of in tin the form of stannous fluoride form a tin-rich deposit when brushed onto dentin (28670) blocking the dentinal tubules and preventing stimulation of free nerve endings (28649).\nImmunomodulating effects\nIn rats, tin influences the activity of heme oxygenase commonly associated with immune function and thymus homeostasis (75111). Also, it has been suggested that the thymus may secrete tin-bearing factors involved in increasing immunity toward malignancies, and these compounds may slow age-related immune function loss (28636)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of Tinospora cordifolia is the whole plant. The whole plant extract contains the bitter principles columibin, chasmanthin, and palmarin. The leaves contain calcium, phosphorus, and alkaloids including tinosporide, tinosporic acid, tinosporol, and protoberberine. Other constituents identified in the plant include lignans, diterpenes, furan lactones, phenyl propane glycosides, arabinogalactan, cordifol, and cordifolide. The stem contains the alkaloids berberine, palmitine, tembertarine, and magniflorin (92228, 92232). Tinosporin, a constituent, has been identified in the leaves, stem, and roots (15092, 92223, 92228).\nAnalgesic effects\nIn animal models, an aqueous methanolic extract of the whole Tinospora cordifolia plant has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic effects (92222).\nAnti-allergic effects\nFor allergic rhinitis, Tinospora cordifolia is thought to produce immunostimulatory effects and decrease mast cell release of histamine (15085).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is interest in using Tinospora cordifolia for treating cancer. An alcohol extract of Tinospora cordifolia has antitumor effects in animal models of lymphoma. This extract increases macrophage phagocytosis and increases the secretion of IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). It also seems to slow tumor growth and increase survival in tumor-bearing animal hosts (15078). In combination with radiation, a Tinospora cordifolia stem extract increases survival of mice in a cancer model (92228). In vitro, Tinospora cordifolia extracts have cytotoxic activity against cervical cancer cells which is comparable to doxorubicin (15084). The cytotoxic effects of Tinospora cordifolia extract appear to be due to pro-oxidant and lipid peroxidative effects with a decrease in glutathione-S-transferase activity (92223, 92228).\n\nIn other animal models, Tinospora cordifolia extracts seem to decrease angiogenesis (15090).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nClinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that Tinospora cordifolia can reduce fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (111503). Additionally, in animal research, aqueous and alcoholic extracts of Tinospora cordifolia seem to lower blood glucose and lipid levels in models of diabetes (15079, 15080, 15082, 15083, 92229, 106847). Tinospora cordifolia might affect glucose levels by increasing pancreatic excretion of insulin, increasing tissue utilization of glucose, decreasing glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, or a combination of these (15079). Constituents of Tinospora cordifolia, including palmatine, jatorrhizine, mangnoflorine, and berberine, are reported to have insulin mimicking and releasing effects (98225).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animal models, an aqueous methanolic extract of the whole Tinospora cordifolia plant has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic effects (92222). In an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, the anti-inflammatory effects of an extract of Tinospora cordifolia aerial parts are related to decreased production of inflammatory cytokines (92231).\nAnti-osteoporotic effects\nIn an ovariectomized animal model, a Tinospora cordifolia ethanolic stem extract reduces bone loss without mimicking the hormonal effects of estrogen on the reproductive organs (92224). Tinospora cordifolia stem and aerial extracts also reduce bone turnover, possibly by inhibiting degradation by osteoclasts (92224, 92231).\nAnti-pyretic effects\nIn animal models, an aqueous methanolic extract of the whole Tinospora cordifolia plant has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic effects (92222).\nAntioxidant effects\nTinospora cordifolia has antioxidant effects. In animal and in vitro research, Tinospora cordifolia water extract decreases markers of oxidative damage (15082, 15087, 15088, 15091, 15092, 92229). However, in a cancer cell line, the cytotoxic effects of a Tinospora cordifolia extract appear to be due to pro-oxidant and lipid peroxidative effects with a decrease in glutathione-S-transferase activity (92223).\nCognitive effects\nThere is interest in using Tinospora cordifolia to limit the behavioral and cognitive changes that occur due to aging and menopause. A 12-week study in acyclic female rats suggests the anxiety index is lower when Tinospora cordifolia powder is added to normal feeds, but not when added to high-fat feeds. However, adding Tinospora cordifolia to normal or high-fat feeds may improve memory (110532).\nEndocrine effects\nIn vitro, the proliferative effects of an ethanolic extract of Tinospora cordifolia stem on prostate cells appears to be due to androgenic effects (92225).\nHepatoprotective effects\nIn moderate alcoholics without liver disease, intake of Tinospora cordifolia stem extract reduces levels of liver enzymes, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides. This extract also reduces urinary excretion of various nutrients, especially pyridoxine, niacin, and biotin (92232).\nImmunomodulating effects\nSeveral constituents of Tinospora cordifolia have immunomodulating effects. These include clerodane furano diterpene glycoside, cordioside, syringin, cordifolioside A and B, and cordiol (15086). Tinospora cordifolia also contains an immunostimulatory alpha-glucan polysaccharide. In vitro, this alpha-glucan activates natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and B cells. It also induces production of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (15089). Both water and alcohol extracts of Tinospora cordifolia stems seem to have immunostimulatory effects. In animal models, these extracts significantly increase leukocyte counts and inhibit cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression. An alcohol extract of Tinospora cordifolia stems also inhibits cyclophosphamide-induced anemia (15081).\nMetabolic effects\nThere is interest in using Tinospora cordifolia to limit the metabolic changes that occur with aging and menopause. A 12-week study in acyclic female rats suggests that adding Tinospora cordifolia powder to normal feeds attenuates weight gain, but not when added to high-fat feeds. However, Tinospora cordifolia decreases triglycerides and blood glucose when added to normal or high-fat feeds (110531).\nRenoprotective effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that Tinospora cordifolia extracts may have renoprotective effects. In a rat model of diabetes, Tinospora cordifolia improved serum creatinine and urea levels and reduced inflammation and fibrosis in the kidneys, possibly through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) dependent pathways (106847)."

It is unclear if oral tiratricol is beneficial for treatment of hypothyroidism following ablative therapy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma.\nIn small clinical trials in patients that have undergone ablative therapy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma and are receiving levothyroxine, tiratricol reduces pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion (1617, 1618). However, combined treatment with low dose tiratricol along with physiologic doses of levothyroxine results in greater inhibition of pituitary TSH secretion in only 50% of patients and produces similar effects on peripheral tissues when compared with supraphysiologic doses of levothyroxine alone (1618).\nless\nPituitary resistance to thyroid hormone (PRTH). It is unclear if oral tiratricol is beneficial in PRTH.\nTiratricol has been evaluated for PRTH, with mixed findings.

Tiratricol also stabilized height- and weight-for-age scores versus baseline and improved these scores when compared to untreated historical controls. The tiratricol dose was titrated to a target T3 level, with the target dose reached in 5 months, on average. After titration, the mean maintenance dose of tiratricol was 38 mcg/kg/day (110018).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTiratricol is a metabolite of thyroid hormone in humans, with a structure closely related to thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). It occurs in small amounts in the body as a minor metabolite of T4 (1633, 1634).\nThyroid effects\nTiratricol acts at the anterior pituitary gland causing a decrease in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn lowers levels of T4 in euthyroid individuals. Levels of T3 in the periphery are increased, which would be expected to cause thyrotoxicosis, with increased metabolic rate, body temperature, tachycardia, and weight loss. However, the overall thyroid effects of tiratricol in an individual seem to vary, possibly depending on dose and the basal thyroid status. Some data suggest that tiratricol has fewer peripheral effects than T3 or T4, possibly due to its rapid clearance and short half-life. This results in limited peripheral calorigenic potency, no increase in basal metabolic rate or sleeping energy expenditure, weight gain, and an overall hypothyroid state (98213, 98215). However, tiratricol has also been reported to have peripheral thyromimetic effects, resulting in tachycardia, tremor, heat intolerance, and weight loss (98214, 98215). A mouse model of monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) deficiency suggests that receiving high-dose intracerebroventricular tiratricol decreases plasma T3 and T4 levels and may impact the expression of T3 regulating genes (111722). Another mouse model of MCT8 deficiency suggests that receiving daily subcutaneous high-dose tiratricol in the early postnatal period promotes CNS function and maturation (111740).\nWeight effects\nA small clinical study in patients with mild obesity receiving a low-calorie diet suggests that that taking tiratricol does not reduce weight when compared with matched controls receiving a low-calorie diet alone (1611). Another small clinical study suggests that taking tiratricol reduces weight in patients with mild obesity receiving a low-calorie diet, but not in those with a normal weight receiving a normal diet (1612)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Vitamin E is an essential fat-soluble nutrient that includes two distinct chemical analogues: tocotrienols and tocopherols. Tocotrienols are unsaturated vitamin E derivatives that possess an isoprenoid side chain, while tocopherols are saturated vitamin E derivatives (29991). This monograph focuses on tocotrienols. Commercial tocotrienols are primarily obtained from natural sources, such as annatto, palm, or rice bran oil (72223, 99690, 104428). They are also found in wheat germ, barley, other grains, and nuts (107390). The first report occurred in 1964; however, interest in tocotrienols did not increase until the 1980s and 1990s for their purported cholesterol-lowering and anticancer effects (29991).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Tocotrienols have been used with apparent safety at doses of up to 600 mg daily for up to 18 months (99690, 99695, 99696, 104427, 104428, 112286). Tocotrienols have also been used with apparent safety at a dose of 200 mg daily for up to 5 years (99697).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of tocotrienols when applied topically.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, tocotrienols appear to be well-tolerated. No adverse effects have been reported in clinical trials.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nTopically: Mild itching.\nDermatologic\nTopically, a cream containing 5% tocotrienols has been reported to cause mild itching in 7% of patients in one clinical study (99699). Contact dermatitis has been reported in 33% of patients using a cream containing vitamin E as a mixture of tocopherols and tocotrienols (4721). However, it is unclear if this effect resulted from tocopherols, tocotrienols, or the combination.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDiabetes. Oral tocotrienols may improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials of adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking a tocotrienol-rich fraction, primarily derived from palm fruit, 250-400 mg daily for 2-18 months leads to slight improvements in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo (112286). The benefit was primarily among those with a higher baseline HbA1c, a duration of diabetes less than 10 years, and in studies with a duration of less than 6 months. Most studies were rated high quality with a low risk of bias, but most were also small with moderate heterogeneity. Most of the studies were conducted in Malaysia, where tocotrienol-rich palm oil was already regularly consumed as part of the diet, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings to other populations with different baseline tocotrienol intakes.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nHypercholesterolemia. Oral tocotrienols are not likely to induce clinically meaningful improvements in cholesterol levels.\nA meta-analysis of 19 small clinical trials shows that taking tocotrienols 50-600 mg daily for 1-6 months does not decrease levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with control. Tocotrienols were shown to increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by a modest and clinically insignificant amount. Sub-group analyses did not find that baseline lipid levels, or dose and duration of tocotrienol supplementation, notably alter results (104430). These findings are limited because the studies included not only patients with hypercholesterolemia, but also healthy patients and patients with various conditions such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and kidney disease.\n\nTocotrienols have also been studied in combination with tocopherols (28730, 85107, 104430) and polymethoxylated flavones (99694) without notable benefit.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Oral tocotrienols have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small study in healthy adults over 40 years of age with self-diagnosed, subjective memory decline shows that taking a specific combination supplement (BGG Japan Co.) containing tocotrienols 50mg and astaxanthin 9 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly improves composite and verbal memory when compared with placebo (105099). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer.\nless\nAging. Although there is interest in using oral tocotrienols for aging, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tocotrienols for this condition.\nAlopecia areata. Although there is interest in using topical tocotrienols for alopecia areata, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tocotrienols for this condition.\nAlzheimer disease. Although there is interest in using oral tocotrienols for Alzheimer disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tocotrienols for this condition.\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral tocotrienols are beneficial for improving early breast cancer outcomes or preventing recurrence.\nClinical research in Malaysian patients with early-stage breast cancer shows that taking tocotrienols 200 mg daily, in conjunction with tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years, does not improve survival or reduce the rate of cancer recurrence when compared with taking tamoxifen with placebo (99697). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of randomization and insufficient power to evaluate an effect on cancer-related mortality.\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). Although there is interest in using oral tocotrienols for CKD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tocotrienols for this condition.\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral tocotrienol-rich vitamin E is beneficial for slowing diabetic nephropathy progression.\nA small clinical study in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking a specific tocotrienol-rich vitamin E supplement (Tocovid SupraBio, Hovid Nutriworld) 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks seems to modestly reduce serum creatinine, with a corresponding increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), when compared with placebo. According to a sub-group analysis, these improvements remained statistically significant in patients with low tocopherol levels (less than 42 mcmol/L) at baseline, but not in those with higher levels at baseline (103010). Another small clinical study shows that taking this same supplement regimen for 12 months reduces serum creatinine levels and improves eGFR at 8 months, but not 12 months, when compared with placebo. In a subgroup analysis of patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease, these benefits persisted at 12 months when compared with placebo (107390).\nless\nFamilial dysautonomia. It is unclear if oral tocotrienols are beneficial for familial dysautonomia outcomes.\nA small clinical study in patients with familial dysautonomia shows that taking tocotrienols 100 mg for 3-4 months decreases the number of hypertensive crises by at least 50% in about 80% of patients when compared to baseline (28720). However, another small clinical study shows that taking tocotrienols 50 mg or 100 mg daily for 3 months improves subjective symptom reports, but does not improve objective clinical measurements, when compared to baseline (99700). The validity of these findings is limited by small study sizes and the absence of comparator groups.\nless\nHypertrophic scars. It is unclear if topical tocotrienols improve hypertrophic scar appearance or vascularity.\nA clinical study in adults with recently healed surgical scars shows that applying a cream containing 5% tocotrienols twice daily for 6 weeks does not improve scar appearance or vascularity at the end of treatment or 10 weeks after treatment completion when compared with a placebo cream (99699). It is unclear if a cream containing a greater concentration of tocotrienols might be beneficial.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear whether oral tocotrienols are beneficial in patients with prediabetes.\nA small clinical trial in adults with untreated prediabetes shows that taking delta-tocotrienol 300 mg orally daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels and improves glycated hemoglobin and the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) when compared with placebo (107856).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral tocotrienols have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate sized clinical trial in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking delta-tocotrienols 500 mg and resveratrol 300 mg daily for 24 weeks improves body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress compared with placebo (112144). It is unclear if these effects are due to the tocotrienols, resveratrol, or the combination.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Small clinical studies suggest that oral tocotrienols may modestly improve steatosis and other outcomes in patients with NAFLD.\nA small clinical trial in adults with NAFLD shows that taking tocotrienols 200 mg twice daily for one year might reduce steatosis, as measured by ultrasound hepatic echogenic response, when compared with placebo (99695). Another small clinical trial in overweight or obese adults with NAFLD shows that taking a specific product (American River Nutrition, Inc.) containing 90% delta-tocotrienol and 10% gamma-tocotrienol, as 300 mg twice daily for 24 weeks, modestly reduces fatty liver index (FLI), hepatic steatosis measured by ultrasound, and liver enzyme levels when compared with placebo (104428). These findings are limited because liver biopsy was not used to determine disease progression. Assessment by liver ultrasound examination has limited accuracy when used in obese patients and when testing for steatohepatitis or fibrosis.\nless\nPostmenopausal conditions. It is unclear if oral tocotrienols are beneficial for improving symptoms in postmenopausal patients.\nA small clinical study in postmenopausal patients shows that taking a specific product (DeltaGold70) 430 mg or 860 mg daily, containing 300 mg or 600 mg tocotrienols, respectively, for 12 weeks does not improve quality of life, body weight, or body fat percentage when compared with placebo (99690).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral tocotrienols are beneficial for improving outcomes in patients after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).\nObservational research in patients after an ischemic stroke or TIA has found that taking tocotrienols 400 or 800 mg daily for one year is associated with reduced resistance to aspirin in patients using aspirin with clopidogrel, but not in patients using only aspirin or only clopidogrel, when compared with placebo (104429).\nless\nWound healing. Although there is interest in using topical tocotrienols for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tocotrienols for this condition.\nMore information is needed to rate tocotrienols for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with tocotrienols.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn animals and humans, dietary tocotrienols are absorbed with dietary triglycerides into plasma in chylomicron lipoproteins (28722). In healthy individuals, the bioavailability, including the peak plasma concentration and plasma concentration time curve, of tocotrienols from self-emulsifying formulations was increased compared to the bioavailability from a non-self-emulsifying formulation of the soya oil (28724).\nDistribution\nIn animals, dietary tocotrienols are deposited into adipose tissue along with dietary triglycerides (28722). In fasting humans, it has been suggested that dietary tocotrienols do not increase plasma tocotrienol concentrations, but platelet concentrations of delta-tocotrienol double (28722, 67551). However, in human studies, intake of tocotrienols increased plasma levels of alpha-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienols in a dose-dependent manner (28695, 99692, 99693), reaching a maximum concentration after approximately 5-7 hours (99692, 99693). Additionally, one clinical study shows that taking tocotrienols 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks results in an average steady state alpha-tocotrienol plasma concentration of 2.5 mM/L (99696).\n\nOral tocotrienols can reach the brain (28688, 99696). In the human epidermis, alpha-tocotrienol and gamma-tocotrienol make up 1% and 3% of total tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols), respectively (28704). After taking tocotrienols 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks, epidermal concentrations of alpha-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol increased significantly when compared with control. Taking this same dose of tocotrienols also increases the abdominal adipose concentration of tocotrienol by 10-fold when compared with control (99696). In human research, tocotrienol intake increased tocotrienol levels in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (28728, 28729).\nMetabolism\nIn humans, oral tocotrienyl acetate is metabolized to alpha- and gamma-carboxyethyl-hydroxychromans with a 1% to 2% recovery of the alpha-compounds and a 4% to 6% recovery of the gamma-compounds in urine (28725). In vitro, the conversion of the tocotrienols to the carboxychromanols was found to be due to a CYP4F2-catalyzed omega-hydroxylation reaction (28726).\nExcretion\nIn humans, the half-life for tocotrienols is approximately 4-7 hours (28723, 99692, 99693).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nNatural tocotrienols exist in four isomers: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienols (29991).\nAnti-diabetes effects\nTocotrienols increase insulin sensitivity by restoring expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 and glucose transporter type 4. They also increase Akt signaling in skeletal muscles and upregulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (107856). In clinical research, delta-tocotrienol has been shown to upregulate the expression of insulin release genes when compared with placebo (107855).\nAnti-inflammatory activity\nA meta-analysis of 13 trials shows that tocotrienols reduce C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, although this effect was primarily driven by one study using a high dose of 600 mg delta-tocotrienol daily. This analysis did not find any effect on interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (107389). However, a study of delta-tocotrienol 250 mg daily reported reductions in high-sensitivity CRP, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 (107855).\nAntiaging effects\nTocotrienols reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lower ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation and erythrocyte hemolysis in vitro (28685). Theoretically, this activity may contribute to the purported antiaging effects of tocotrienols.\nAnticancer effects\nTocotrienols, or tocotrienol-rich fractions of products, have shown anticancer effects in animal models and in vitro. In animal models, benefits of tocotrienols include reduced tumor volume and suppression of carcinogenesis (14047, 28702, 28705). In vitro, tocotrienols have shown anti-proliferative effects (14049, 28687, 28701, 28702, 28707, 28711, 28713). Potential mechanisms of action have been proposed based on in vitro research. These include the induction of S phase arrest (28702) and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and apoptosis (28707, 28709, 28712), as well as effects on levels of the total retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and its phosphorylation at the Ser780, Ser795, Ser 807/811, and Thr826 positions (28708), downregulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways and Bcl-2, upregulation of Bax, activation of caspase-3, and subsequent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (28709), inhibition of NF-kappaB activation (28710), reduction in the expression of cyclins B1 and D1 and cyclin-dependant kinases 1 and 4 (28708), p53-dependent induction of WAF1/p21 (14049), induction of cAMP production upstream from EGF-dependent MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt mitogenic signaling (28716), and altered expression of various genes, such as c-myc-binding protein MM-1, 23-kDa highly basic protein, interferon-inducible protein 9-27 (IFITM-1) (14048), and interferon-inducible transmembrane protein-1 and CD59 glycoprotein precursor (14047). Also, gamma- and delta-tocotrienols reduced tumor promotion by inhibiting Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV EA) expression (28717). Other studies in vitro have suggested that Bax/Bcl-2 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage do not play a role in the mechanism of action of tocotrienols (28715).\nAntioxidant activity\nTocotrienols have shown antioxidant effects in vitro (28691, 28692, 28703). Using an oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, the antioxidant activity of 30% tocotrienols was found to be 1229 mM of Trolox equivalent per gram (28703). Alpha- and gamma-tocotrienol have been shown to inhibit human glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GST P1-1) in a concentration-dependent manner (28691). In humans and animals, dietary tocotrienols incorporated into circulating human lipoproteins; in vitro, these isolated lipoproteins react with peroxyl radicals (28692). However, in the human epidermis, epidermal levels of tocotrienols were not correlated with free radical scavenging activity (28704). Unlike tocopherols, tocotrienols distribute uniformly in the cellular bilayer and penetrate tissues with saturated fatty layers. This gives them about 50 times greater antioxidant activity than tocopherols (107390).\nAutonomic effects\nIn humans with familial dysautonomia, tocotrienols increase the expression of monoamine oxidase A, IKBKAP mRNA, and the IKAP protein in peripheral blood cells (28720, 28721, 99700). However, in one clinical trial, IKBKAP mRNA expression returned to pretreatment levels after 6 months of continuous tocotrienol supplementation. It is hypothesized that this reduction in levels is due to the development of tolerance to the effects of tocotrienols (99700).\nCardiovascular effects\nProposed cardioprotective mechanisms of action of the tocotrienols include their antioxidant effects and ability to act as pharmacological preconditioning agents (28689). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that tocotrienols, especially delta-tocotrienol, inhibit adhesion molecule expression and monocytic cell adherence (28693, 28718).\nCYP450 effects\nIn vitro, the tocotrienols specifically bind to and activate the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) resulting in tissue-specific induction and increased expression of some SXR target genes, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in hepatocytes (28719). However, in intestinal cells, tocotrienols induce glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) and multidrug resistance protein-1 (MDR1), but not CYP3A4. In vitro, delta-tocotrienol increased the expression of CYP1A1 gene (28702).\nHepatic effects\nThere is interest in using tocotrienols to treat liver disease. After oral administration, tocotrienols are distributed to the liver, where they have been shown to exert a potent antioxidant activity on microsomal lipid peroxidation (99695, 104428). Gamma-tocotrienols have also demonstrated the ability to inhibit hepatic triglyceride accumulation (99695). Some preliminary clinical research in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) shows that taking tocotrienols for up to one year reduces plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein, and malondialdehyde. Taking tocotrienols has also been shown to improve hepatic echogenic response and fatty liver index in this population (99695, 104428). Also, a case series of seven patients with end-stage liver disease shows that taking tocotrienols improves measures of liver dysfunction when compared with taking tocopherol (99696).\nHypolipidemic effects\nIn human research, some, but not all, clinical trials suggest that tocotrienols reduce levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, as well as triglycerides (3237, 3238, 3240, 28695, 28730, 72223, 85107). In vitro, tocotrienols cause posttranscriptional suppression of HMG-CoA reductase (28698), likely due to the stimulation of HMG-CoA reductase degradation (28699).\nNeuroprotective effects\nIn vitro, alpha-tocotrienol protected HT4 and primary neuronal cells against toxicity induced by glutamate and other toxins by a mechanism thought to be independent of antioxidant effects. It was suggested that the potential mechanism of action involved c-Src kinase and lipoxygenase (28688).\n\nThere is also interest in whether tocotrienols reduce progression of neuropathy by improving nerve conduction. Small clinical studies in patients with diabetes show that taking a tocotrienol-rich supplement (Tocovid) for up to 1 year seems to modestly increase nerve conduction velocity when compared with placebo. Theoretically, tocotrienols might improve nerve velocity and sensation by increasing blood levels of nerve growth factor (104427, 107388)."

Consuming tomatoes and tomato-based products does not appear to reduce the risk of bladder cancer.\nObservational studies have found no association between tomato and tomato-based product intake and the risk of bladder cancer (2407).\nless\nBreast cancer. Consuming tomatoes and tomato-based products does not appear to reduce the risk of breast cancer.\nObservational studies have found no association between tomato or tomato-based product intake and risk of breast cancer (15747).\nless\nDiabetes. Consuming tomatoes and tomato-based products does not appear to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes or improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nObservational studies have found that increasing intake of tomato or tomato-based products does not significantly decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (14004, 14361). Additionally, a small clinical study in non-smoking male patients with type 2 diabetes shows that consuming raw tomato 200 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve plasma glucose levels when compared to baseline (102477). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of comparator group.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. It is unclear if tomato improves skin appearance.\nA small study of females aged 35-55 shows that taking a certain tomato pulp product (Lumenato, Lycored) 1 capsule daily for 12 weeks improves patient reported skin appearance scores when compared to baseline (110523). The interpretation of this result is limited by the lack of a placebo group.\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral tomato powder has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with BPH shows that taking 5 grams of a whole tomato food supplement consisting of tomato powder and polyphenols extracted from olives daily for 2 months improves quality of life and reduces lower urinary tract symptoms including urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and nocturia when compared to baseline. No improvements in these symptoms were reported with placebo (106656). It is unclear if these findings are due to tomato, olive polyphenols, or the combination.\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if consuming tomato-based foods reduces the risk of cardiovascular events.\nObservational research has found that increased consumption of tomato-based foods is associated with an insignificant trend towards a reduced risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular events (10418, 102178).\nless\nCataracts. It is unclear if consuming tomatoes reduces the risk of cataracts.\nObservational research has found that eating more than 3 servings of tomatoes each week may decrease the risk of developing cataracts (9439).\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if consuming tomatoes reduces the risk of cervical cancer.\nObservational research has found that increased tomato intake is associated with a decreased risk of cervical cancer (2407).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Research on the benefits of consuming tomatoes or tomato-based products for the prevention of colorectal cancer is conflicting and limited to observational studies only.\nSome observational research has found that increasing tomato or tomato-based product intake is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (2404, 2407). However, higher quality observational research has found that tomato-based product intake is not associated with risk of colorectal cancer (15747).\nless\nExercise-induced asthma. It is unclear if oral tomato extract is beneficial in patients with exercise-induced asthma.\nA small clinical study in patients with exercise-induced asthma shows that taking a specific tomato extract (Lyc-O-Mato, LycoRed Ltd) 30 mg daily for 1 week seems to reduce exercise-induced asthma when compared with placebo. The tomato extract seems to prevent decreases in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in response to exercise (7898).\nless\nGastric cancer. Research on the benefits of consuming tomatoes or tomato-based products for the prevention of gastric cancer is conflicting and limited to observational studies only.\nSome observational studies have found that increasing tomato or tomato-based product intake is associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer in some subgroups of patients (2407, 15747, 102480). However, other observational research has found that tomato-based product intake is not associated with risk of gastric cancer (15747). In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding tomatoes and gastric cancer risk. However, the FDA concludes that it is highly unlikely that tomatoes reduce the risk of gastric cancer (102375).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Small clinical studies suggest that consuming tomato sauce or semi-dried tomatoes may modestly reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nOne small, open-label clinical trial in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that consuming a specific vine-ripened tomato sauce (OsteoCol, C.G. Food, SRL) 150 mL daily for 6 weeks reduces total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels when compared to baseline. Patients adherent to the tomato sauce regimen showed an 11 mg/dL and 12 mg/dL reduction in total and LDL cholesterol, respectively, while those consuming a sterol-enriched yogurt saw total and LDL cholesterol levels decrease by 18 mg/dL and 16 mg/dL, respectively. Patients with a baseline LDL cholesterol level of greater than 152 mg/dL saw the greatest benefit from this tomato sauce (106653). Another small clinical study in Japanese patients with borderline high cholesterol shows that taking 50 grams of a semi-dried tomato containing lycopene 22-27.8 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces LDL cholesterol levels but does not affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with taking 50 grams of a tomato without lycopene (102180). This suggests that any benefit of tomato on blood lipid levels is likely due to its lycopene content.\nless\nHypertension. Small clinical studies and observational research suggest that oral tomato extract or dietary tomato consumption may modestly reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension.\nSeveral small clinical trials in patients with hypertension show that taking a specific tomato extract product (Lyc-O-Mato, LycoRed, Ltd.), providing lycopene 15-30 mg daily, for 6-8 weeks, reduces systolic blood pressure by around 7-13 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by around 4-6 mmHg when compared to baseline (14287, 60415, 102182). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, a large observational study, conducted over 3 years, suggests that moderate consumption of tomato-based products (i.e., 44-82 grams daily) is associated with marginally lower blood pressure when compared with higher and lower consumption in older adults with grade 1 hypertension. However, this association is not seen in patients with grade 2 or 3 hypertension (113145). Interpretation of these results is limited by self-reported data and lack of generalizability outside of confounders relating to a Mediterranean lifestyle.\n\nEvidence on the use of tomato in patients with pre-hypertension is mixed. One small clinical study in patients with pre-hypertension shows that taking a specific tomato extract (Fruitflow, Provexis Plc, UK.) 150 mg as a single dose seems to modestly reduce blood pressure over a 24-hour period when compared with placebo (102478). This study is limited by its small size and short duration. Another small clinical study in pre-hypertensive patients shows that taking a specific tomato extract (Lyc-o-Mato, LycoRed Ltd) containing lycopene 15 mg daily for 8 weeks does not reduce blood pressure when compared with placebo (42079).\n\nThe impact of dietary tomato consumption on preventing hypertension has also been evaluated. A large prospective observational study in Chinese adults without a history of smoking or myocardial infarction suggests moderate dietary intake of tomatoes (i.e. up to 33.3 grams daily) is associated with a 49-58% reduction in the risk of developing new onset hypertension when compared with no consumption after about 6 years' follow up. However, the associated risk reduction was less with higher consumption (110525). These results may not apply to patients in countries where dietary trends are different, and the validity of these findings is limited by the potential for confounding. Another large observational study, conducted over 3 years in older adults at high cardiovascular risk, suggests that higher consumption (i.e., at least 1 large-sized tomato daily) is associated with reduced risk of hypertension by 36% when compared with moderate and lower consumption (113145). However, interpretation of these results is limited by self-reported data, and lack of generalizability outside of confounders relating to a Mediterranean lifestyle.\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if consuming tomatoes reduces the risk of lung cancer; the available research is conflicting.\nSome observational studies have found an association between increased tomato and tomato-based product consumption and a reduced risk of lung cancer; however, many of these studies were not stratified based on the patient's smoking status. Higher quality, large-scale observational studies have not found any association between tomato product intake and lung cancer risk (15747).\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if consuming tomatoes improves muscle strength or attenuates declines in muscle strength.\nA small observational study in Japanese adults 22-68 years of age found that more frequent tomato consumption (2 or more times weekly) is associated with an attenuated rate of handgrip strength decline over 3 years when compared with less frequent tomato consumption (102473).\nless\nOvarian cancer. Research on the benefits of consuming tomatoes or tomato-based products for the prevention of ovarian cancer is conflicting and limited to observational studies only.\nSome observational research has found that increased tomato or tomato juice intake is not associated with risk of ovarian cancer; however, consuming tomato sauce two or more times weekly is associated with a decreased risk (2407). Other observational research has found that increased dietary intake of lycopene, particularly from tomato sauce, is associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer in premenopausal patients (10133). In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding tomato sauce and ovarian cancer risk. However, the FDA concludes that it is highly uncertain that tomato sauce reduces the risk of ovarian cancer (102375).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. Research on the benefits of consuming tomatoes or tomato-based products for the prevention of pancreatic cancer is conflicting and limited to observational studies only.\nA large-scale observational study have found that that tomato or tomato-based product intake is not associated with a decreased risk of pancreatic cancer (15747). However, other observational studies have found that raw tomato intake, and high tomato intake in general, is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (2407, 15747, 15750). In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding tomatoes and pancreatic cancer risk. However, the FDA concludes that it is highly unlikely that tomatoes reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer (102375).\nless\nProstate cancer. Consuming tomatoes or tomato-based products may slightly lower the risk of prostate cancer; however, observational research is mixed and high-quality clinical trials addressing tomato intake and prostate cancer risk are lacking.\nSome observational studies have found that consuming tomato products, including tomatoes, tomato sauce, pizza, or tomato juice, one time or more per week, is associated with a modest reduction in the risk of prostate cancer (2406, 7772, 7895, 12878, 15747, 102476). However, other observational research has found that tomato consumption is not associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer (14125, 15172, 15747, 92171). One small clinical study in patients with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia shows that taking tomato extract capsules containing lycopene 30 mg daily for 6 months does not impact benign tissue endpoints when compared with placebo (102471). In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that one-half to one cup of tomatoes or tomato sauce weekly may reduce the risk of prostate cancer. However, the FDA concludes that there is little scientific evidence to support this claim (102375).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if drinking tomato juice is beneficial in patients with radiation dermatitis.\nOne small, uncontrolled clinical trial in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer shows that drinking tomato juice 160 mg daily for 6 months after radiotherapy improves the severity of dermatitis within 1 month of treatment when compared to baseline (106654). The lack of a comparator group limits the validity of these findings; it is unclear how tomato juice consumption compared with the natural resolution of radiation dermatitis.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate tomato for these uses.",

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nA specific tomato extract (Fruitflow, Provexis Plc) 150 mg has been standardized to contain up to 9 mg nucleoside derivatives, up to 10 mg phenolic conjugates, and up to 7 mg flavonoid derivatives (102478).",

            "Interactions with Supplements": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nBETA-CAROTENE\nBeta-carotene might alter the absorption of lycopene from tomatoes or tomato extracts.\nSome evidence suggests that taking beta-carotene supplements 20-60 mg daily increases the absorption of lycopene from supplements and from the diet (2403, 23015). However, other studies have reported that beta-carotene supplements have no effect on lycopene serum levels (23017, 23018), or that they decrease lycopene serum levels (23016). These differences may be due to other factors affecting absorption, such as whether the supplements were taken with or between meals, and how much fat was present, which increases absorption (94226).\nless\nCALCIUM\nTheoretically, calcium might reduce the absorption of lycopene from tomatoes or tomato extracts.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a specific calcium carbonate supplement (Cacit 500, Warner Chilcott) 500 mg while eating a meal containing lycopene 19 mg reduces the bioavailability of lycopene by 83%. The mechanism of this effect is not known; however, it is suspected that calcium inhibits the uptake of lycopene in the gastrointestinal tract (95578).\nless\nLUTEIN\nLutein might reduce the absorption of lycopene from tomatoes or tomato extracts.\nThere is some evidence that taking a single 24 mg oral dose of lutein decreases the absorption of lycopene from supplements and from the diet, possibly due to competition for transport in chylomicrons. However, taking lutein 12 mg orally daily for 3 weeks does not affect plasma levels of lycopene (92165, 94227).\nless",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nConsuming an excessive amount of tomato leaves or unripe green tomatoes can cause severe mucous membrane irritation, vomiting, diarrhea, colic, dizziness, stupor, headache, bradycardia, respiratory disturbances, and mild spasms. In very severe cases, death by respiratory failure might occur. These toxic effects are due to tomatine, a glycoalkaloid found in tomato leaves and unripe green tomatoes (18, 102957).\n\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation of overdose with ripe tomato fruit.\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with tomato.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nLycopene is better absorbed from tomato products, such as tomato paste, than from fresh tomatoes (1497). Consumption of tomato juice can also significantly increase serum lycopene levels (1498, 6607). Consuming a lycopene-rich tomato paste extract causes a 2-fold increase in lycopene serum levels in healthy volunteers (14053).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of tomato are the fruit, leaf, and vine. Tomato fruits are the major dietary source of the carotenoid lycopene. Lycopene is better absorbed from tomato products, such as tomato paste and tomato juice, than from fresh tomatoes (1497, 1498, 6607). One cup (240 mL) of tomato juice contains approximately 23 mg lycopene, depending on the brand (1499). Other bioactive constituents in tomato fruits include beta-carotene, phytoene, and phytofluene (106655). Tomato stems and unripe, green tomatoes contain a mildly toxic glycoalkaloid called tomatine, which is used by the tomato plant to protect itself against insects and microbes (102957).\nAnti-cancer effects\nTheoretically, the lycopene found in tomato is thought to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Decreased serum or tissue lycopene concentrations are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (1447, 1496, 2405, 2406, 2407).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in tomatoes to reduce inflammation. A meta-analysis of mostly small, low-quality clinical studies in adults suggests tomato consumption may decrease the inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor alpha but does not decrease c-reactive protein or interleukin 6 (110521). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, which utilized various tomato regimens and enrolled patients of varying health status.\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that tomato powder has greater antioxidant effects than lycopene, suggesting that the antioxidant capacity of tomato powder is enhanced by other constituents beyond lycopene, including beta-carotene, phytoene, and phytofluene (106655).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in tomatoes for the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors. In healthy patients, consuming a low fiber diet (LFD) and tomato paste purée 80 grams daily for 7 days reduces stiffness index, but does not affect flow mediated dilatation, blood pressure, or lipid levels, when compared with LFD without tomato paste (102470). Other research suggests that tomato might affect blood pressure. However, it is not clear which constituents are most likely to cause this reduction. In a clinical study in patients with stage one hypertension, drinking tomato juice 200 grams enriched with polyphenols from an ethanolic tomato extract daily for 4 weeks did not reduce blood pressure when compared with drinking regular tomato juice with lower polyphenol content (102472). A clinical feeding study in healthy patients suggests that consuming a single dose of raw tomatoes 7 grams/kg, tomato sauce 3.5 g/kg, or tomato sauce with refined olive oil 3.5 g/kg seems to reduce total cholesterol, triglycerides, and inflammatory biomarkers over 6 hours when compared with a sugar control, suggesting that it may reduce the risk for atherosclerosis (102479). A crossover study in healthy adults suggests that taking a specific tomato extract (Fruitflow II, Provexis Plc, UK.) for 4 weeks improves serum markers of oxidative stress (i.e. malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity) and reduces platelet activation and aggregation when compared with placebo (110522). Animal research also shows that the glycoalkaloid tomatine, present in unripe green tomatoes, can lower cholesterol levels by binding cholesterol and forming a compound that cannot be absorbed in the intestinal tract (102957).\nCentral nervous system effects\nA small crossover study in healthy males suggests dietary tomato consumption is a bioavailable source of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (110524).\nCholinergic effects\nThe glycoalkaloid called tomatine, present in tomato stems, tomato leaves, and unripe green tomatoes, inhibits acetylcholinesterase in vitro. Theoretically, the neurologic toxicity that can occur after excessive consumption of tomatine is due to acetylcholinesterase inhibition and the precipitation of cholinergic crisis (102957).\nGlycemic effects\nThere is interest in using tomatoes to improve glycemic control. One small crossover trial in healthy females shows that drinking tomato juice 200 grams 30 minutes before consuming carbohydrates reduces postprandial glucose levels when compared with water. Consuming raw tomato did not have this effect (106652). Also, a small study in non-smoking male patients with type 2 diabetes found no improvement in glucose levels with the consumption of raw tomato 200 grams daily for 8 weeks (102477).\nImmunomodulating effects\nResearchers have speculated that tomato products might stimulate immune function. However, there is evidence that long-term consumption of tomato juice has no effect on cell-mediated immune function (6607).\nPhotoprotective effects\nThere is interest in using the carotenoids in tomato, such as lycopene, to protect from ultraviolet (UV) skin damage. In a small clinical study, healthy patients consuming tomato paste 55 grams (containing lycopene 16 mg) in olive oil daily for 12 weeks seemed to be more tolerant to a higher UV light exposure when compared to baseline, but not when compared to the control group consuming olive oil alone. Some biochemical markers of mitochondrial DNA and dermal extracellular matrix damage such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 were reduced in the tomato group when compared with control (60452).\nSkin effects\nThere is interest in using the carotenoids in tomato to improve the appearance of aging skin. A small study in healthy patients aged 24-36 years shows that taking a certain tomato pulp product (Lumenato, Lycored) 1 capsule daily for 4 weeks increases plasma levels of phytoene, phytofluene, and zeta-carotene when compared to baseline (110523). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo group."

In mouse and rat models of diabetes with electrically- or laser-induced thrombosis, lower doses of tormentil extract decreased thrombus formation, likely through antiplatelet effects. However, higher doses failed to demonstrate antiplatelet effects and, in some cases, increased thrombus formation and decreased fibrinolysis. More research is needed to determine if tormentil has antiplatelet or pro-coagulant effects (107433).\nWound healing effects\nIn a rat model of diabetes, daily topical application of a methanolic extract of tormentil root to full-thickness excision wounds increases the wound contraction rate and decreases the wound area similar to that seen in non-diabetic rats. The extract also increases wound collagen levels (105747)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTransfer factor refers to a heterogenous mixture of dialyzable polypeptide molecules extracted from leukocytes of humans and animals, such as cows and mice (1493, 1494). Bovine transfer factor is structurally similar to human-derived transfer factor (7788). Transfer factor contains more than 200 different substances including peptides and polynucleotides (7790, 78629, 78638, 78690, 78716). The molecules in transfer factor are generally less than 12,000 Daltons (78736, 78813, 97665).\n\nTransfer factors are products of T-lymphocytes that transfer the ability to express delayed-type hypersensitivity and cell-mediated immunity from sensitized donors to non-immune recipients (7793). Transfer factors are derived from sources that have developed immunity to certain infectious diseases. For example, bovine transfer factor for cryptosporidiosis is prepared by first inoculating calves with cryptosporidium and then harvesting of lymph nodes (1410, 1420, 1445, 1480, 7791). Human-derived transfer factor is prepared from blood of donors with antigen-specific immune responses (1476, 1507).\n\nThere is some evidence that transfer factors can be stored for 12 months and retain potency (7790).\nImmune effects\nThe theory is that use of transfer factor from sensitized donors, human or animal, can cause deficient recipients to express cell-mediated immunity (1493). This effect is antigen-specific and results in expression of delayed type hypersensitivity and production of lymphokines (1493, 1495, 1507, 7788). In humans, taking transfer factor improves levels of various cytokines in the cervical epithelium (97664). Animal studies indicate that transfer factor prepared from bovine lymphocytes or bovine colostrum confers cell-mediated immunity to specific antigens on recipients of different species (1475, 1477, 1478, 7791, 7792).\n\nThe exact mechanism of action of transfer factors is unknown; however, a specific amino acid sequence in transfer factor has been identified, and antigen specificity is well-established (1475, 1477, 1478, 7793). Although the recipient of transfer factor acquires the ability to express the cell-mediated immune responses of the donor, the serum of the recipient will not cause a similar response if used to inoculate an unsensitized individual. The production of transfer factor appears to be regulated by immune response genes, but the immunologic activities of transfer factor are not (7789). It is possible that transfer factors might cause an immune response by different mechanisms than active immunization (7793).\n\nResearch suggests that transfer factors specific to a variety of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and other parasites might be useful for microbial diseases (7790). However, there is no evidence that non-specific transfer factor products, such as those marketed on the internet, are effective for any indication.\n\nThe immune effects of transfer factor have been shown to be associated with antiviral responses in humans and in animal models (97664) and anti-cancer and antiviral effects in animal models (78612, 78648, 78658, 78681)."

Tree tobacco can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, changes in blood pressure and heart rate, muscle weakness and paralysis, respiratory distress, and neurological symptoms including vertigo, confusion, fatigue, headache, hallucinations, spasms, weakness, and coma. Death has occurred in up to 40% of reported cases of tree tobacco poisoning (28735, 28736, 28737, 28738, 28739, 98622, 98623, 106641).\nCardiovascular\nOrally, tree tobacco has been reported to cause hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, and asystole (28735, 98623, 106641).

In goats, sheep, swine, and cattle, administration of tree tobacco or anabasine during pregnancy induced cleft palate and congenital malformations of bones and joints in offspring (28740, 28741, 28742, 28743, 28744, 28745, 28746, 28747, 28748, 28749)(28750, 28751, 28752, 28753).\n\nIn animals, the LD50 of anabasine is reportedly 22 mg/kg (28734).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "General: Limited information is available regarding the pharmacokinetics of tree tobacco. To date, evidence regarding the pharmacokinetics of tree tobacco focuses on its anabasine constituent.\nDistribution\nAnabasine was found in samples from patients who died from eating tree tobacco as follows: blood 1.2-2.2 mg/L, urine 2-74 mg/L , heart 10 mg/kg, kidney 16 mg/kg, brain 11 mg/kg, lung 11 mg/kg, liver 1.7 mg/kg, bile 2.7 mg/L, and gastric contents 113 mg/L (28737, 28738).\nExcretion\nThe half-life of anabasine in humans is reported to be about 16 hours. Anabasine is excreted in the urine (29993).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of tree tobacco is the leaf. The fresh leaves of tree tobacco contain racemic anabasine (0.05%), nicotine (0.002%), nornicotine (0.007%), myosmine (0.008%) and cotinine (0.006%) (28762, 28763). Dried leaves of tree tobacco were found to contain 0.175% to 0.23% anabasine (28741). The leaves and bark have been found to contain more anabasine than the wood (28752). Tree tobacco also contains chlorinated amides such as N-(2',6'-diethylphenyl)-2-chloroacetamide and N-(butyloxymethyl)-N-(2',6'-diethylphenyl)-2-choroacetamide (28764), scopoletin, triacontanol, stigmasterol-3-beta-O-D-glucopyranoside (28764), quercetin, and rutin (28766). Tree tobacco contains cholesterol derivatives including 7-dehydrocholesterol, vitamin D3, and its metabolites (28767). Infection of tree tobacco roots by fungi such as Glomus intraradices may induce the formation of glycosylated cyclohexenone derivatives (28765).\nInsecticidal effects\nTree tobacco is used as an insecticide. Laboratory evidence suggests that application of tree tobacco extract 1.72 mcL per square centimeter has 50% effectiveness as a repellent against Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (28755).\nNeurologic effects\nNicotine and anabasine alkaloids present in tree tobacco have a very complex pharmacology involving interaction with nicotinic receptors in ganglia and the brain and stimulation of the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and the brain (28759, 28760, 29992). The actions of these alkaloids are frequently biphasic, with low doses inducing stimulatory effects and high doses causing depressant effects. Anabasine is a selective a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist (28760). Anabasine also has the ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, which may contribute to its toxic effects (28761). However, anabasine appears to be only a weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, suggesting that its primary toxic effects stem from neuromuscular blockade (29992)."

These studies lasted for no more than 12 months and some studies allowed for inclusion of patients who required a reduction in statin dose due to adverse effects (95019, 96140, 101158). Taking this product does not appear to significantly lower triglyceride levels or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in most of these patients (95019, 96140, 101158).

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nBerberine, a constituent of tree turmeric, appears to be a substrate of nuclear transporters such as P-glycoprotein and organic cation transporter. This might limit its oral bioavailability (13525, 96140). Evidence from animal research shows that the time to maximum blood concentration of berberine is 2.4 hours (34320).\nMetabolism\nBerberine appears to undergo phase I hepatic metabolism (13525). Three metabolites-atrorrhizine-3-sulfate, demethyleneberberine-2-sulfate, and thalifendine-10-sulfate have been observed in human urine after the use of berberine chloride (34212).\nExcretion\nBerberine is excreted through urine and feces (2591, 34314).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of tree turmeric are the fruit, stems, leaves, wood, root, and root bark (96143). The primary active constituent of tree turmeric is berberine (13519).\nAnti-cancer effects\nPreliminary research suggests that the tree turmeric constituent berberine might have antitumor effects (13521).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nPreliminary research suggests that berberine, a constituent of tree turmeric, blocks production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL1)-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB, the transcription factor responsible for regulation of cytokine production. Berberine has potential usefulness in treating alcoholic liver disease, which is associated with increased levels of IL1-beta and TNF-alpha (13522). Preliminary research also suggests that berberine selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression (12488).\nAntidiabetic effects\nA meta-analysis including studies of patients with type 1 diabetes and dyslipidemic disorders shows that a combination of tree turmeric and milk thistle significantly decreases fasting blood glucose levels (105756). The validity of this analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations.\nAntimicrobial effects\nBerberine, a constituent of tree turmeric, has antimicrobial effects including antibacterial, antifungal, and some antimycobacterial and antiprotozoal activity (7258, 7259). Berberine has activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Shigella boydii, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporotrichum schenckii, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia lamblia (2530, 2587, 2588, 7258, 7259, 8012). Preliminary research suggests berberine might inhibit bacterial sortase, a protein responsible for anchoring gram-positive bacteria to cell membranes (13540).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary research suggests that extracts of tree turmeric fruit have a dose-dependent positive inotropic effect with a negligible effect on heart rate (13518). A meta-analysis including studies of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemic disorders shows that a combination of tree turmeric and milk thistle significantly decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (105756). The validity of this analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations.\nHepatoprotective effects\nPreliminary research suggests that berberine, a constituent of tree turmeric, might protect the liver from hepatotoxins (13519). Berberine has potential usefulness in treating alcoholic liver disease, which is associated with increased levels of IL1-beta and TNF-alpha (13522).\nHypoglycemic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that the berberine in tree turmeric lowers insulin levels by increasing the expression of the insulin receptor and insulin sensitivity. However, berberine is also thought to repair pancreatic islet cells, increasing insulin production. This is possibly due to the antioxidant effects of berberine (96140, 96142). Berberine also seems to decrease intestinal glucose absorption and increase glucose uptake from the blood (96141).\nHypolipidemic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that the berberine in tree turmeric increases the expression of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, leading to a reduction in LDL cholesterol levels in the blood (96140). Also, berberine seems to downregulate a protein involved in the reduced efficacy of statins (96141)."

Oral tribulus seems to improve sexual experience in females with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) or sexual dysfunction. Some research also shows that oral tribulus improves sexual function in males.\nClinical research in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with HSDD shows that taking tribulus 250 mg three times daily (Androsten, Herbarium) for 3 months improves overall satisfaction and lubrication, as well as pain, desire, sexual arousal, and ability to reach orgasm, when compared with placebo (92027, 97331, 97332). Other preliminary clinical research in females with HSDD shows that taking tribulus extract 7.5 mg daily for 4 weeks improves sexual desire, arousal, satisfaction, orgasm, pain, and lubrication when compared with placebo (92022). A nonblinded clinical study comparing tribulus dosing regimens shows that taking oral tribulus 280 mg, either once daily or in three divided daily doses, for 90 days results in similar improvements in sexual dysfunction, regardless of menopausal status. However, neither dosing schedule increases clitoral blood flow when compared with baseline (108551).\n\nTribulus has also been studied in males. One clinical study in males with erectile dysfunction, with or without HSDD, shows that taking tribulus (Tribestan, Sopharma AD) 500 mg three times daily for 3 months improves sexual desire and intercourse satisfaction when compared with placebo (97330).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Oral tribulus does not seem to improve athletic performance.\nSmall clinical studies in athletes show that taking tribulus orally, alone or in combination with other ingredients such as androstenedione, most often as 450-770 mg daily for 5-8 weeks, does not seem to enhance body composition or exercise performance when compared with placebo or a control group (7514, 13255, 92029, 108552).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAngina.

It is unclear if oral tribulus is beneficial for diabetes.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with type 2 diabetes who are taking oral hypoglycemic agents shows that taking tribulus extract powder 500 mg twice daily for 3 months modestly reduces fasting glucose and postprandial glucose levels, but not glycated hemoglobin, when compared with placebo. However, the validity of these findings is limited by the difference in diabetes severity between groups at baseline (97327).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral tribulus is beneficial for ED. Research is conflicting.\nClinical research in patients with ED shows that taking tribulus (Tribestan, Sopharma AD) 500 mg three times daily for 3 months does not provide a clinically beneficial improvement in erectile function when compared with placebo (97330). Other clinical research shows that taking tribulus 400 mg twice daily for 30 days does not improve erectile function when compared with placebo (92031). However, one preliminary clinical study in patients with partial androgen deficiency shows that taking tribulus 250 mg three times daily for 3 months improves erectile function when compared to baseline (92028).\n\nTribulus has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination supplement (Tradamix TX1000, Tradapharma Sagl) containing tribulus 450 mg, brown algae 300 mg, and chitosan 250 mg twice daily for 3 months improves sexual satisfaction, desire, ejaculation function, and sexual quality of life when compared with placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate ED (92030). It is unclear if these effects are due to tribulus, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral tribulus is beneficial for exercise-induced muscle damage.\nClinical research in a small number of healthy, untrained males shows that taking tribulus 500 mg daily for 2 weeks prior to performing resistance exercise reduces markers of muscle damage, including creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), but does not reduce levels of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6) or C-reactive protein (CRP), when compared with placebo (103236). However, another small clinical study in male CrossFit athletes shows that taking tribulus 770 mg capsules (Quamtrax Pharmaceuticals) daily for 42 days does not reduce CPK but does improve CRP and oxidant status when compared with placebo (111747). However, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant. A very small crossover clinical study in trained male athletes shows that taking 20 mg/kg/day of tribulus in 3 divided doses 30 minutes before meals with 500 mL of water for 4 weeks does not reduce muscle soreness after intensive aerobic exercise when compared with placebo (111746).\nless\nGonorrhea.

It is unclear if oral tribulus can lower blood pressure.\nIn patients with pre-hypertension, clinical research shows that taking powdered tribulus fruit 2 grams three times daily for 2 months reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 6 and 5 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo (105245). It is unclear what effect Tribulus may have in patients with diagnosed hypertension.\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Although there is interest in using oral tribulus for kidney stones, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tribulus for this purpose.\nMale infertility. It is unclear if oral tribulus is beneficial for male infertility; the available research is conflicting.\nCase series suggest that taking a specific tribulus product (Tribestan, Sopharma) 250 mg three times daily for 30 days improves ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, and sperm motility in patients with infertility due to oligoasthenozoospermia (78865), and improves libido and erections in patients with primary hypogonadism (78868). Conversely, a small clinical study in patients with oligozoospermia shows that taking tribulus granules 6 grams daily for 60 days does not improve sperm count when compared with placebo (92032). In patients with idiopathic infertility, taking tribulus 250 mg three times daily for 3 months does not increase sperm concentration, sperm motility, serum testosterone levels, or luteinizing hormone levels (97328). The difference in these findings might be due to the small study sizes, as well as the variable etiology of infertility.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Oral tribulus has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a combination product containing tribulus 40 mg, ginger, saffron, and Ceylon cinnamon (Aphrodit, Goldaru Company) twice daily for 4 weeks improves mental and physical symptoms during menopause, but not genitourinary symptoms, when compared with placebo (97326). It is not clear if this effect is due to tribulus, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOsteoporosis. Although there is interest in using oral tribulus for osteoporosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tribulus for this condition.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Tribulus contains two major alkaloid fractions, the beta-carboline indoleamines harmane and norharmane, flavonoids, and the soponins diosgenin and protodioscin (3929, 12673, 12675, 12676, 78856). Levels of protodioscin are not consistent but depend on soils in which tribulus is grown (78849). Phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of tribulus of Bulgarian origin resulted in the isolation of furostanol saponin 1, also known as tribol (78858). Two steroid saponins, terrestrinins A and B, have also been isolated from tribulus (78857). Three other steroidal saponins were isolated from tribulus in a separate study (78850).\nAnthelmintic effects\nIn vitro research has found that tribulus extract might have anthelmintic activity (12680).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nPreliminary animal research suggests that tribulus lowers blood glucose (12679).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that a specific saponins isolated from tribulus is cytotoxic against a human malignant melanoma cell line (78850). In other in vitro research, saponins from tribulus promotes apoptosis in hepatoma cells (78860). A growth inhibitory effect, as well as morphology effect, on a human breast cancer cell line has also been observed with tribulus in vitro (78855). Spirostanol-based steroidal saponins from tribulus seem to exhibit remarkable activity against human malignant melanoma cell line, human oral epidermoid carcinoma, human breast ductal carcinoma, and human ovary carcinoma cells (78853). In vitro, tribulus regulates tyrosinase activity and melanocyte proliferation (78854).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro research shows that the spirostanol-based steroidal saponins from tribulus exhibit remarkable activity against the fungal organisms Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (78853).\nCardiovascular effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests tribulus might have anti-anginal activity. It seems to dilate coronary arteries and improve coronary circulation (3931). It also may lower blood pressure by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (12673). Extracts from the fruit and leaves seem to have a diuretic effects, which may explain the traditional use of tribulus for kidney stones and other urinary problems (12681). In vitro research shows that a water-soluble extract of tribulus has potent stimulant effects on isolated heart muscle in hypodynamic state (78847). It is thought that a glycoside fraction is present in the extract due to an increase in the force of myocardial contraction with a negative chronotropic effect. Other research shows that an alcohol extract of tribulus fruit has both muscarinic, nicotinic, and hypotensive activity (78864).\nHormonal effects\nSome preliminary clinical research suggests that tribulus can improve sexual dysfunction in males and females and erectile dysfunction in males (92022, 92027, 92028, 92030, 92033, 97330, 97331, 97332). These effects may be due to changes in hormone levels. Preliminary animal research has found that the protodioscin constituent of tribulus increases levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and dihydrotestosterone (12675, 12677, 92077). In animal research, protodioscin had no effect on the isolated corpus cavernosal strips from rabbits (78848, 78869). Steroid saponins extracted from tribulus stimulated sperm production and improved sperm viability in rats (78869).\n\nOne clinical study in adults with partial androgen deficiency suggests that taking tribulus 250 mg three times daily for 3 months significantly increases serum testosterone levels when compared to baseline, with no improvement in luteinizing hormone (92028). Other clinical research shows that taking tribulus daily for 3 months significantly increases free and bioavailable serum testosterone levels in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (97331, 97332). Clinical research in premenopausal and postmenopausal adults suggests that taking tribulus 280 mg once daily for 90 days increases levels of free, total, and bioavailable testosterone when compared to the same dosage taken as three divided doses daily. Neither dosing regimen affected levels of prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone, or sex hormone-binding globulin (108551). However, tribulus may not affect testosterone levels in healthy males. One clinical study in healthy young males shows that taking tribulus daily for 4 weeks has no effect on levels of serum testosterone, androstenedione, or luteinizing hormone (78862). Another small clinical study in male CrossFit athletes undergoing a 1-hour training session three times per week shows that taking tribulus 770 mg daily for 6 weeks has no effect on testosterone or cortisol, nor does it impact testosterone: cortisol ratios, when compared with placebo (108552).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nThere is interest in using tribulus to prevent bone loss after menopause. Research in rats with ovaries removed shows that taking tribulus extract daily for 28 days increases bone mineral density (BMD) when compared with control rats. This increase in BMD is thought to be caused by a tribulus-induced reduction in urinary calcium loss and increase in serum dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels (100338).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nTribulus contains two major alkaloid fractions, the beta-carboline indoleamines harmane and norharmane (78856). Animal research shows that administration of synthetic harmane subcutaneously to sheep causes nervous effects, such as limb paresis. In addition, another tribulus extract exhibits significant analgesic activity in albino mice (78871)."

Tronadora flower extracts contain tannins, saponins, phytosterols, triterpenes, coumarins, anthraquinones, flavonoids, phenols, and alkaloids (96663, 96665, 101175). The leaves have been shown to contain luteolin, apigenin, and chrysoeriol (110888).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that tronadora flower alcoholic extracts have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects (96665, 110887). Theoretically, these effects might be due to its flavonoid constituent's ability to reduce prostaglandin synthesis (96665).\nAntidiabetic effects\nTronadora has been used traditionally for diabetes; however, laboratory research on the effect of tronadora is conflicting. Some animal research suggests tronadora extracts result in a modest reduction in blood glucose. However, normal glucose levels were not achieved (110887, 110888). Other animal research suggests it has no effect on blood glucose (13494) or it causes an initial increase in blood glucose, followed by mild hypoglycemia. It also might decrease hepatic glycogen levels (13495, 13621). In vitro research suggests that tronadora leaf alcoholic extract has pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity. Inhibition of pancreatic lipase blocks digestion and therefore, the absorption and storage, of fats from the diet. Because increased fat mass contributes to insulin resistance, this activity of tronadora is theorized to help reduce fat mass and reduce insulin resistance (96667).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, tronadora alcoholic and aqueous extracts have demonstrated antibacterial activity against E. coli and B. subtilis. The tronadora constituent tecomine also exhibits these antibacterial effects (96663).\nHypotensive effects\nAnimal research suggests tronadora might lower blood pressure (110888).\nLipid effects\nAnimal research suggests tronadora might lower plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels (13494, 110888)."

A small clinical study in patients with colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy shows that taking a specific combination supplement containing trypsin and other enzymes (Wobe-Mugos E) attenuates worsening quality of life, modestly increases relapse-free survival, and increases the number of patients surviving over 42 months (99474). The effects of trypsin alone are unclear.\nDiabetes. A small observational study in patients with a family history of type 1 diabetes found that taking a product containing trypsin 48 mg, bromelain 90 mg, and rutin 100 mg (Mucos Pharma) daily for 24 months is not associated with reduced incidence of type 1 diabetes at 8 years (99472). Further higher quality research is needed to draw a conclusion.\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. A small clinical study shows that taking a combination protease tablet containing papain 50 mg, trypsin 75 mg, bromelain 50 mg, amylase 10 mg, lipase 10 mg, lysosome 10 mg, and chymotrypsin 2 mg, four times in one day before downhill running can improve recovery of contractile muscle function and decrease muscle soreness compared to placebo (67838). The effects of trypsin alone are unclear.\nExercise-induced respiratory infections. A small clinical study in non-elite male runners shows that taking a combination product (Wobenzym Plus, Mucos Pharma) providing rutin 600-1200 mg, trypsin 288-576 mg, and bromelain 540-1080 mg daily for 3 weeks starting one week before a marathon, does not reduce the risk of a post-race upper respiratory tract infection when compared with placebo (96766). A limitation of this study is that it was not powered to detect a difference in exercise-induced infections between groups.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). A preliminary clinical study in patients with relapsing-remitting MS shows that taking an enzyme combination containing trypsin 48 mg, bromelain 90 mg, and rutin 100 mg per tablet for at least 3 months does not affect disability progression, relapses or central nervous system lesions when compared with placebo (99468). The validity of these results are limited by the short duration of treatment, and the effects of trypsin alone are unclear.\nOsteoarthritis. Taking trypsin orally in combination with rutin and bromelain seems to be effective for treating osteoarthritis of the knee. Most clinical research in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking the combination enzyme product (Wobenzym PS, formerly Phlogenzym, Mucos Pharma) at a dose providing up to 600 mg rutin, 288 mg trypsin, and 540 mg bromelain daily for 3-12 weeks, is as effective as diclofenac (Voltaren) 50 mg two to three times daily for relieving pain and improving knee function. This product also seems to reduce the need for rescue medication by 95% compared to placebo (6252, 92235, 99467, 99477). It is unclear if these improvements are due to trypsin, other ingredients, or the combination. Trypsin has not been studied for osteoarthritis as a single-ingredient product.\nPostoperative swelling. A small preliminary clinical study in patients undergoing surgery of the jaw shows that taking an enzyme combination of trypsin 96 mg, bromelain 180 mg, and rutin 200 mg twice daily for 5 days in addition to standard treatment reduces soft-tissue thickness (indicating the amount of swelling) at most of the nine assessed facial-points compared to control (99476). This study is limited by its small size and significant differences in swelling at pre-determined points during the first postoperative day. This suggests that factors in addition to enzyme therapy might have influenced the differences in results.\nRadiation dermatitis. There is conflicting evidence whether taking a combination supplement containing trypsin reduces adverse effects from radiation. Some low quality clinical research in cancer patients receiving radiation therapy suggests that a specific combination product (Wobe-Mugos E, Mucos Pharma), which contains trypsin 40 mg, and other enzymes might reduce adverse reactions at the site of radiation, such as skin deterioration, when compared to no additional treatment (67831, 99471). The results are these studies are limited by a lack of blinding and a lack placebo control. Evidence from another small, but higher quality clinical study shows that taking the same product beginning 3 days prior to radiation and continuing until the last day of radiation therapy does not reduce acute radiation-related complications such as skin deterioration when compared to placebo (67834).\nSprains. A preliminary clinical study in patients with a sprained ankle shows that taking a specific enzyme combination (Phlogenzym, Mucos Pharma) containing trypsin 48 mg, bromelain 90 mg, rutin 100 mg, or taking different combinations of the individual enzymes three times daily for 10 days is not more effective for relieving pain than placebo (99473). The effects of trypsin alone are unclear.\nWound healing. Some preliminary evidence suggests that applying trypsin topically in combination with chymotrypsin may be helpful for cleansing wounds of necrotic material and enhancing wound healing (715, 716). Other preliminary research suggests that applying trypsin topically in combination with castor oil and Peru balsam may improve wound healing, including the healing of infected wounds. However, as a debriding agent, trypsin seems to be no better than mechanical gauze (99573).

It has been used in a dose of 3 grams daily for 24-36 months for breast (1648, 1650, 1654, 1656), colorectal (1657, 1660, 70165, 70167, 70168, 70171, 70173, 70174, 70176, 70190)(94076), esophageal (1649), gastric (1640, 1651, 1652, 1657, 1658, 1659, 1660, 70161, 70170, 70175)(70179, 70181, 70183, 70186, 70189, 70191, 70194, 70198), hepatic (1655, 70188), and lung cancers (1653, 70180, 70184), as well as for leukemia (70200, 70206). It has also been used in a dose of 1 gram daily for up to 72 months for colorectal cancer (94076), 1 gram three times daily for 1 month for nasopharyngeal cancer (1661, 70195), and 2 grams/m2 per day in 3 divided doses, rotating in cycles with chemotherapy, for gastric cancer (1659, 70194, 70195).\n\nA meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials including over 2500 patients with esophageal, gastric, colon, rectal, breast, or nasopharyngeal cancer, shows that taking PSK in addition to conventional therapy reduces 5-year mortality by 9% when compared with conventional therapy alone. When individual cancer types are considered, the benefit of PSK is most evident in patients with breast, gastric, colon, or rectal cancer (94076). Another meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials shows that taking PSK, polysaccharide peptide (PSP), or turkey tail mushroom in combination with chemotherapy is associated with a 17% lower risk of mortality in some, but not all, types of cancer when compared with chemotherapy alone. However, overall there was no difference in relapse-free survival or total clinical efficacy, defined as complete responses plus partial responses (102915). The reliability and relevance of these meta-analyses is unclear since the trials looked at several different types of cancer, used varying doses and durations of therapy with different turkey tail mushroom extracts, and were all conducted in China or other Asian countries.\n\nResearch on the use of whole turkey tail mushroom rather than the constituent PSK for treating cancer is limited. A small clinical study in 15 patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma shows that taking turkey tail mushroom 2.4 grams daily for 6-12 weeks does not improve time to progression, progression-free survival, overall survival, or quality of life when compared with placebo (96568). However, this study was likely underpowered to detect any differences.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCervical dysplasia. Intravaginal turkey tail mushroom has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA specific vaginal gel (Papilocare, Procare Health) containing turkey tail mushroom, neem, carboxymethyl-beta-glucan, hyaluronic acid, gotu kola, aloe, and alpha-glucan oligosaccharide has been examined in preliminary clinical and observational research in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cervical lesions. One clinical study shows that topical application for 6 months is associated with a normal Pap smear in 85% of patients, compared with 65% of those receiving only regular monitoring. Benefits were greatest in high-risk patients (108305). In patients over 40 years of age, treatment with this gel resulted in a normal Pap smear in 92% of patients, compared with 50% of those receiving only regular monitoring (111905). Both studies also showed improvements in cervical re-epithelization and HPV clearance (108305, 111905). Observational research has also been conducted. One observational study in patients with high-risk HPV infection has found that using this same product is associated with 4.8-, 2.3-, and 5.1-fold increased odds of HPV DNA clearance, remission at colposcopy, and remission with cytology at 6 months, respectively, when compared with untreated patients (108306). In another observational study, using this product for 6 or 12 months is associated with repair of cervical low-grade lesions and a normalized cytology and colposcopy in about 75% of patients. HPV clearance was achieved in 71.6% of patients (111904). Doses of gel administration have varied. The gel is usually applied once daily for 21 days, followed by 7 days with no treatment, and then alternate days for up to 2-12 months (108305, 108306, 111904, 111905). It is occasionally applied once daily for 21 days, followed by 7 days with no treatment, repeated for 3 months, and then alternated days for 3 months (108305).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).

These are polysaccharide krestin (PSK) and polysaccharide peptide (PSP) (94075, 94076). Both are commercially available and used as health supplements (91751, 94075, 94076). In one clinical study, a water extract of the fruiting bodies of turkey tail mushroom contained 33.8% total polysaccharides (94073).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with turkey tail mushroom.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAnimal studies with radio-labeled polysaccharide krestin (PSK), a constituent of turkey tail mushroom, show that it is partially decomposed to small molecules in the digestive tract (1642). Radio-labeled PSK is completely absorbed within 24 hours following oral administration in mice, and peak plasma levels of low molecular weight substances occur at 0.5-1 hours in rats and 1-2 hours in rabbits. Larger molecules such as PSK appear in the serum after 4-24 hours.\nDistribution\nIn mice, radio-labeled PSK or its metabolites have been detected in the digestive tract, bone marrow, salivary glands, thymus, adrenal gland, brain, liver, spleen, pancreas, and tumor tissue. The most prolonged activity is found in the liver and bone marrow (1642).\nExcretion\nIn animals, approximately 70% of radio-labeled PSK is excreted in expired air, 20% in feces, 10% in urine, and 0.8% in bile. Approximately 86% is excreted within 24 hours (70192).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of turkey tail mushroom are the fruiting body and mycelium (5494). The turkey tail mushroom fruiting body contains triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, friedelin, glutinol, ursolic acid, corosolic acid, esculentic acid, lupeol, and betulinic acid), sterols (e.g., cerevisterol), polysaccharides, ribonucleotides (dihydrouridine, deoxyuridine), phenols (vanillic acid, viridoside, and benzoic acid derivatives), glycosides (ethylglucopyranoside, nigerose, and trehalose), and furans (e.g., methoxyfurfural) (102916).\n\nTurkey tail mushroom is used in two forms, either as the extract of the fruiting bodies or as biomass, which contains mycelia and primordia. The biomass may be more resistant to proteolytic enzymes and may have immune activities not present in the extract form (91751). Turkey tail mushroom biomass has secondary metabolites such as terpenes, steroids, and anthraquinones that are not found in turkey tail mushroom extract (91751). Turkey tail mushroom contains several polysaccharides, including polysaccharide peptide (PSP) and polysaccharide krestin (PSK), which are thought to be the active components of turkey tail and are used medicinally (1600, 1635, 1636, 1637, 1638, 1639, 1640, 1641, 1642, 1648, 1649, 1650, 5484, 5494, 94073). PSP is isolated from the COV-1 strain of turkey tail mushroom via water extraction and alcoholic precipitation. It is a Chinese product. PSK is isolated from the CM-101 strain via water extraction and salting out with ammonium sulfate. It is a Japanese product (91751, 94073, 94075, 94076). Differences in growing environments and strains lead to varying biological activities of turkey tail mushroom (94075).\nAnalgesic effects\nPreliminary research in animals suggests that turkey tail mushroom might have analgesic activity (1645, 1646).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro, triterpenoids and sterols from turkey tail mushroom fruiting bodies have been shown to inhibit nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6, suggesting anti-inflammatory activity (102916).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research suggests that turkey tail mushroom may have antidiabetic effects. Extracellular polysaccharopeptides (ePSP) from turkey tail mushroom appear to regulate glucose metabolism through several pathways, including increasing glucose transporters in cell membranes and decreasing gluconeogenic enzymes, such as glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver, which help lower postprandial blood glucose levels. (116174).\n\nAdditionally, an animal model of diabetes suggests that turkey tail mushroom might be protective against pancreatic inflammation (108307). However, turkey tail polysaccharide does not inhibit alpha-amylase activity, indicating that this may not play a role in the antidiabetic effects of turkey tail mushroom (111907).\nAntifungal effects\nIn tumor-bearing mice, polysaccharide krestin (PSK) has a protective effect against experimentally-induced Candida albicans infection. This effect is possibly mediated by Th1 cell functions (70169).\nAntineoplastic effects\nThere is interest in using turkey tail mushroom, specifically polysaccharide peptide (PSP) or polysaccharide krestin (PSK), for antineoplastic effects. These polysaccharides have cytotoxic activity against various tumor cells in vitro (102915). PSK has been used in Japan as a biological response modifier in cancer chemotherapy regimens with varying results (1640, 1641, 1651, 1652, 1653, 1654, 1655, 1656, 1657, 1658)(1659, 1660, 1661, 1662, 94076). PSK has been found to inhibit tumor cell motility as well as chemotactic activity for macrophages (70203). PSK may prevent cancer metastasis by inhibiting tumor invasion and adhesion, reducing production of cell matrix-degrading enzymes, reducing tumor cell attachment to endothelial cells, suppressing tumor cell migration, inhibiting angiogenesis, and modulating cytokine production. PSK has also been found to stimulate the immune system and to activate the classical and alternative pathways of the complement cascade, which may further contribute to its antineoplastic effects (1642, 70204, 70205, 94073). In humans, PSK is considered to exert an immune-potentiating effect on T-lymphocytes (70196). Various animal and human trials show that markers of immunosuppression, including serum alpha-2 globulin levels, stimulation index, immunosuppressive acidic protein, sIL-2R, interleukin-10, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, sialic acid, and killer T cells are lower in groups receiving PSK (1642, 1649, 70164, 70170, 70178, 70186, 70198). The immunologic effects of PSK in humans appears to be determined by the duration, not frequency, of PSK administration (1658). It therefore seems that PSK suppresses cancer metastasis at several different steps and that its mechanism of action includes direct action on the tumor cell as well as immunomodulation (1637, 70207). In humans, HLA alleles may be associated with resistance or susceptibility to lymph node metastasis, and HLA-A2 antigen may be a useful predictor of the response to PSK (70212).\n\nEarly evidence suggests that PSP may have activity against lung cancers, leukemia, hepatomas, and gastric cancers (1635, 96569). When given with cyclophosphamide, PSP seems to improve immune function by increasing white cell, natural killer cell, and antibody levels (10291). It also increases release of interleukins 1-beta, 2, and 6, and of tumor necrosis factor alpha (96569).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal research suggests that polysaccharide krestin (PSK) , a constituent of turkey tail mushroom, improves mRNA transcription to enhance glutathione peroxidase activity (70160). Other animal research suggests that turkey tail mushroom powder has antioxidant effects (108307).\nAntiviral effects\nLaboratory research suggests that polysaccharide peptide (PSP) , a constituent of turkey tail mushroom, has activity against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via inhibition of reverse transcriptase and an enzyme involved with viral glycosylation (1643, 1644).\nHepatoprotective effects\nAnimal research suggests that polysaccharide peptide (PSP), a constituent of turkey tail mushroom, might protect against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (1647).\nVaginal effects\nPreliminary research shows that intravaginal application of a commercially available combination product containing beta- glucans, Azadirachta indica, aloe vera, and turkey tail mushroom (Palomacare, Procare Health), once daily at bedtime for 12 days in between periods, improves reepithelization of the cervical mucosa and overall vaginal health as measured by elasticity, fluid volume, pH, epithelial integrity, and moisture, when compared with baseline. Results also showed a nonsignificant improvement in vaginal microbiota which may protect against vaginal conditions such as human papilloma virus (HPV) infection (94074)."

It is used in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, and in Indian religious ceremonies (11140). Curcumin is the yellow-colored primary active constituent derived from turmeric (102345). This turmeric constituent is commonly used to color foods and cosmetics (6002).",

It is unclear if turmeric caused this adverse event or if other ingredients or a contaminant were the cause. The patient had taken a combination supplement containing turmeric 1500-2250 mg, black soybean 600-900 mg, mulberry leaves, garlic, and arrowroot each about 300-450 mg, twice daily for one month before experiencing atrioventricular heart block. Heart rhythm normalized three days after discontinuation of the product. Re-administration of the product resulted in the same adverse effect (17720).\nless\nDermatologic\nFollowing occupational and/or topical exposure, turmeric or its constituents curcumin, tetrahydrocurcumin, or turmeric oil, can cause allergic contact dermatitis (11146, 79270, 79470, 79934, 81410, 81195). Topically, curcumin can also cause rash or contact urticaria (79985, 97432, 112117). In one case, a 60-year-old female, with no prior reactivity to regular oral consumption of turmeric products, developed urticaria after topical application of turmeric massage oil (97432). A case of pruritus has been reported following topical application of curcumin ointment to the scalp for the treatment of melanoma (11148). Yellow discoloration of the skin has been reported rarely in clinical research (113356). Orally, curcumin may cause pruritus, but this appears to be relatively uncommon (81163, 97427, 104148, 114899). Pitting edema may also occur following oral intake of turmeric extract, but the frequency of this adverse event is less common with turmeric than with ibuprofen (89720). A combination of curcumin plus fluoxetine may cause photosensitivity (89728).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, turmeric can cause gastrointestinal adverse effects (107110, 107112, 112118), including constipation (81149, 81163, 96135, 113355), flatulence and yellow, hard stools (81106, 96135), nausea and vomiting (10453, 17952, 89720, 89728, 96127, 96131, 96135, 97430, 112117, 112118), diarrhea or loose stool (10453, 17952, 18204, 89720, 96135, 110223, 112117, 112118, 114898, 114899), dyspepsia (17952, 89720, 89721, 96161, 112118), gastritis (89728), distension and gastroesophageal reflux disease (18204, 89720), abdominal fullness and pain (81036, 89720, 96161, 97430, 114898, 114899), epigastric burning (81444), and tongue staining (89723).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, turmeric has been associated with liver damage, including non-infectious hepatitis, cholestasis, and hepatocellular liver injury. There have been at least 70 reports of liver damage associated with taking turmeric supplements for at least 2 weeks and for up to 14 months. Most cases of liver damage resolved upon discontinuation of the turmeric supplement. Sometimes, turmeric was used concomitantly with other supplements and medications (99304, 102346, 103094, 103631, 103633, 103634, 107122, 109288, 110221). The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has identified 10 cases of liver injury which were considered to be either definitely, highly likely, or probably associated with turmeric; none of these cases were associated with the use of turmeric in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic supplements. Most patients (90%) presented with hepatocellular pattern of liver injury. The median age of these case reports was 56 years and 90% identified as White. In these case reports, the carrier frequency on HLAB*35:01 was 70%, which is higher than the carrier frequency found in the general population. Of the ten patients, 5 were hospitalized and 1 died from liver injury (109288).\n\nIt is not clear if concomitant use with other supplements or medications contributes to the risk for liver damage. Many case reports did not report turmeric formulation, dosing, or duration of use (99304, 103094, 103631, 103634, 109288). However, at least 10 cases involved high doses of curcumin (250-1812.5 mg daily) and the use of highly bioavailable formulations such as phytosomal curcumin and formulations containing piperine (102346, 103633, 107122, 109288, 110221).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, turmeric has been associated with headache and vertigo (81163, 114898).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, the turmeric constituent curcumin or a combination of curcumin and fluoxetine can cause giddiness, although this event seems to be uncommon (81206, 89728).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, turmeric has been linked to one report of kidney failure, although the role of turmeric in this case is unclear. A 69-year-old male developed kidney failure related to calcium oxalate deposits in the renal tubules following supplementation with turmeric 2 grams daily for 2 years as an anti-inflammatory for pelvic pain. While turmeric is a source of dietary oxalates, pre-existing health conditions and/or chronic use of antibiotics may have contributed to the course of disease (113343).\nless\nOther\nThere is a single case report of death associated with intravenous use of turmeric. However, analysis of the treatment vial suggests that the vial contained only 0.023% of the amount of curcumin listed on the label. Also, the vial had been diluted in a solution of ungraded polyethylene glycol (PEG) 40 castor oil that was contaminated with 1.25% diethylene glycol. Therefore the cause of death is unknown but is unlikely to be related to the turmeric (96136).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral turmeric seems to improve symptoms in people with allergic rhinitis.\nA large clinical study in people with allergic rhinitis shows that taking a specific curcumin product (Organika Health Products) 500 mg daily for 2 months reduces nasal symptoms, including sneezing, itching, runny nose, and congestion, when compared with placebo (96138).\nless\nDepression. Most research shows that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, when used at doses of at least 1 gram daily for at least 6 weeks improves symptoms of depression when taken alone or in combination with antidepressant medications.\nCurcumin appears to be most beneficial for depression in middle aged patients compared to older patients, when taken for at least 6 weeks, and when used at a dose of at least 1 gram daily. In adults with major depressive disorder, a meta-analysis of data from 6 clinical studies, as well as individual studies not included in this analysis, show that taking curcumin 1 gram daily along with an antidepressant moderately improves depression symptoms when compared with placebo (96131, 96139). Another meta-analysis of 10 studies shows symptom reductions in patients with major depression when combined with conventional antidepressants, but not when used alone in patients with milder depressive symptoms. However, the quality of the evidence is low (104971). Additionally, a large clinical study in adults with mild-moderate symptoms of depression shows that taking curcumin 750 mg twice daily for 12 months modestly reduces depression symptoms when compared with placebo (114898).\n\nWhen used alone, one clinical study shows that curcumin 1 gram daily for 6 weeks may be similarly effective to fluoxetine 20 mg daily. Taking both products together seems to be more effective than either product alone, increasing the response rate from 65% to 78% (89728).\n\nGuidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that curcumin extract at doses of 500-1000 mg daily is provisionally recommended for monotherapy or adjunctive use in mild to moderate depression (110318).\nless\nDyspepsia. Oral turmeric may be modestly beneficial for some patients with dyspepsia. In patients with functional dyspepsia, small clinical studies show that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is similarly effective when compared with the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole.\nClinical research shows that taking turmeric 500 mg four times daily for 7 days can relieve overall symptoms of dyspepsia in 64% more patients than taking placebo (11144). A small, unblinded clinical study in patients with a type of dyspepsia called postprandial distress syndrome shows that taking turmeric 250 mg or 500 mg orally three times daily after meals for 4 weeks is associated with reductions in symptom scores which are similar to those seen with simethicone 60 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. However, the recurrence rate upon stopping therapy was about 14% with simethicone, compared with 43% to 46% with turmeric (104963).\n\nIn patients with functional dyspepsia, taking the constituent curcumin appears similarly effective when compared with omeprazole, but might not provide further symptom reduction in those also taking famotidine or omeprazole (106063, 106801, 111599). One small clinical study in Iran shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily in addition to famotidine 40 mg daily for 30 days is no more effective for reducing overall symptoms of dyspepsia, such as abdominal pain, heartburn, bloating, and nausea, when compared with famotidine alone (106063). Another small clinical study in Thailand shows that taking curcumin 500 mg four times daily for 4 weeks is similarly effective for reducing dyspepsia severity and improving satisfaction when compared with an unspecified dose of omeprazole and more effective when compared with placebo (106801). Similarly, a moderate-size clinical study in Thailand shows that taking curcumin 500 mg four times daily for 4 weeks is similarly effective for reducing dyspepsia severity when compared with omeprazole 20 mg daily. However, taking curcumin and omeprazole in combination did not provide further symptom reduction (111599). The validity of these results is limited by the high rate of study dropouts.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Research is conflicting on whether oral turmeric, curcumin, or curcuminoids can reduce serum lipids. Any improvement in lipids is likely to be small. Reasons for the conflicting findings may relate to turmeric formulation, duration of treatment, and/or the baseline cholesterol status of the included patients.\nResults from meta-analyses of clinical research show inconsistent and conflicting results. One large meta-analysis of over 50 clinical studies in healthy adults and those with a variety of conditions shows that supplementation with turmeric or curcumin 80-4000 mg daily for 4-24 weeks reduces total cholesterol by 4 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 7 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 2 mg/dL when compared with placebo (112119). Two other meta-analyses of 27 clinical studies agree that taking turmeric, curcumin, or curcuminoids moderately reduce triglyceride levels but suggest that turmeric does not improve total cholesterol when compared with placebo. However, the meta-analyses contradict one another on whether turmeric and its constituents reduce LDL cholesterol or increase HDL cholesterol. (96128, 96135). Additionally, a third meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials shows that taking up to 2400 mg daily of curcumin or curcuminoids, from turmeric or isolated sources, for up to 12 weeks, does not significantly improve triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or total cholesterol (110220).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, seems to attenuate fat deposition and improve some metabolic parameters in adults with NAFLD.\nClinical research shows that taking curcumin daily reduces NAFLD severity in 30% to 79% of patients, compared to 5% to 27.5% of patients receiving placebo. Curcumin also reduces the quantity of additional fat deposition in the liver to 0% to 4.5%, compared to 17.5% to 26% in those taking placebo. Most research shows that taking curcumin also reduces liver enzyme levels, body mass index (BMI), blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and total cholesterol when compared with placebo. Although some clinical research shows that taking curcumin improves levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that these lipid levels are not improved in patients with NAFLD, specifically (97430, 97431, 100258, 102350, 106062, 107120, 109279, 111349, 114901). However, another meta-analysis of 14 small, heterogeneous clinical studies in adults with NAFLD, that included some of these studies, shows that taking various doses and forms of turmeric or curcumin modestly reduces liver enzyme levels, improves measures of insulin resistance, reduces waist circumference, and improves LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (111348). A small clinical trial in patients with NAFLD given specific lifestyle recommendations shows that taking curcumin modestly reduces the frequency of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver but does not have beneficial effects on fatty liver-associated indices, adiposity, or the atherogenic index, when compared with placebo (109285). Findings for specific endpoints are mixed between individual studies and may depend on the dose and formulation of curcumin used or the duration of treatment.\n\nThese studies have used various doses and formulations. In one study, 500 mg of a dispersion formulation equivalent to 70 mg of curcumin daily for 8 weeks was used (97430). Also, 250 mg once daily or 500 mg twice daily of a specific phytosomal formulation (Meriva, Indena) containing curcumin and soy phosphatidylcholine in a 1:2 ratio and standardized to an overall curcuminoid content of 20% was taken for 8 weeks (97431, 106062). Another study used 1 gram of powdered turmeric rhizome taken three times daily with meals for 12 weeks (102350). One study used a curcumin-piperine complex (Curcumin C3 complex 500 mg plus Bioperine 5 mg) daily for 8 weeks (107120). One study used curcumin (Arjuna Natural Extract) 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks (109285).\n\nDespite positive results with curcumin in several small clinical studies of patients with NAFLD, there is some concern that curcumin might cause hepatotoxicity in rare cases, especially when highly bioavailable formulations are used in high doses (103633). There is also evidence that the risk for hepatotoxicity with curcumin may be increased in individuals with the HLAB*35:01 allele (109288). Curcumin-induced hepatotoxicity has not been reported in clinical trials of patients with NAFLD, and its potential mechanism is unclear. However, patients seeking to take curcumin for NAFLD should be advised to monitor for symptoms of hepatotoxicity, including abdominal pain, dark urine, fatigue, jaundice, nausea, and pruritus.\nless\nOral mucositis. Oral curcumin or curcumin-containing mouthwash seem to reduce the development of severe oral mucositis, as well as reduce the severity and pain of oral mucositis, associated with cancer treatment.\nClinical research in patients receiving radiotherapy following recent radical surgery for oral cancer shows that taking turmeric (BCM-95, Arjuna Natural Pvt. Ltd., India) during radiotherapy reduces the incidence of severe oral mucositis to 25% or 20% in those taking turmeric 500 mg two or three times daily, respectively, compared with 65% in those taking placebo. The incidences of severe oral pain, dysphagia, and dermatitis were also reduced by at least 50% (105398). A small clinical study in patients receiving chemotherapy with or without head and neck radiotherapy shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 7 weeks improves severity of oral mucositis at weeks 1, 4, and 7 and reduces pain at week 7 when compared with placebo. Effects were more pronounced in those with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis than radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis (106800). In patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy, preliminary clinical research shows that swishing with 10 mL of turmeric solution (prepared by dissolving turmeric 400 mg in 80 mL of water) six times daily for 6 weeks delays mucositis and reduces the number of cases of intolerable mucositis by 49% when compared to swishing with 10 mL of povidone-iodine solution twice daily for 6 weeks (89726). Another small clinical study shows that swishing with 10 mL of nanoparticulate curcumin 0.1% mouthwash three times daily for 6 weeks is associated with a 50% lower risk of developing oral mucositis, and a delay of 2 weeks in the onset of mucositis, when compared with benzydamine 0.15% mouthwash (104969). A small clinical study in patients with mucositis due to head and neck radiotherapy shows that taking curcumin nanoparticles (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 40 mg daily or using 10 mL of a curcumin 0.1% mouthwash three times daily for up to 21 days improves scores related to pain, burning, ulceration, and erythema when compared with placebo. Results with either oral or topical curcumin were similar (111350).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Some oral turmeric extracts and combination products containing turmeric seem to improve certain symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. However, it is unclear how turmeric compares to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nSeveral meta-analyses of clinical studies show that turmeric extracts and/or curcuminoid products reduce knee pain and stiffness, improve physical function, and reduce the need for rescue medication when compared with placebo (104970, 106792, 109280, 110222). However, a reduced effect was noted in patients with increasing age or body mass index (104790). The studies evaluated in these meta-analyses are heterogeneous, of low- to moderate-quality, and utilized a variety of products and/or dosing strategies (104970, 106792, 109280, 110222). Small to moderate-sized clinical studies show that specific products (Meriva, Indena; Theracurmin, Theravalues Corp) containing curcumin 90-100 mg twice daily for up to 6 months, or specific turmeric extracts (Turmacin, Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd.; Curcugen, DolCas Biotech, LLC) 500 mg twice daily for 6-12 weeks, reduce pain and analgesic use and improve functionality when compared with placebo (17953, 80988, 89721, 97424, 104148, 107118). A specific turmeric extract (CuraMed, EuroPharma USA) 1500 mg daily for 12 weeks improves functionality, but not pain, when compared with placebo (96127). Also, a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina), 40 mg twice daily for 6 weeks, improves pain, stiffness, and physical activity scores and reduces intake of rescue acetaminophen by about 60% when compared with placebo (102349). However, not all turmeric products seem to be effective for improving symptoms of osteoarthritis. One small clinical study shows that taking a specific turmeric extract (B-Turmactive, PLAMECA S.A.) 500 mg daily for one week does not reduce knee pain when compared with placebo (104147). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that benefits are limited to bio-optimized forms of curcuminoids, and benefits related to pure extracts are lacking (110222).\n\nTurmeric has also been compared with conventional treatments for knee osteoarthritis in small meta-analyses, a network meta-analysis, and individual clinical studies. However, the evidence is mixed as to whether turmeric is as effective or more effective than NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen 400 mg taken 2-3 times daily, diclofenac 25-100 mg daily, or chondroprotective drugs (17952, 89720, 89722, 106792, 109280, 110222, 113607). A network meta-analysis comparing 6 interventions in adults with knee osteoarthritis suggests that curcumin monotherapy, curcumin with chondroprotective agents, or curcumin with NSAIDs improves scores related to pain, function, and stiffness while reducing the need for rescue medication and the incidence of adverse events (113607). Individual studies are heterogenous with respect to comparator medication and dosing schedule. Doses included a non-commercial turmeric extract 500 mg 3-4 times daily for 4-6 weeks (17952, 89720) or turmeric extract 500 mg twice daily for 3 months (89722).\n\nTopical turmeric has also been evaluated. One clinical study shows that applying curcumin topically as a 5% ointment in Vaseline twice daily for 6 weeks reduces pain associated with knee osteoarthritis by a mean of about 11 on a 100-point visual analog scale when compared with placebo (104964). Another clinical study in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that applying curcumin in a self-nano-emulsifying polyethylene glycol organogel 1.5 grams to the knee twice daily for 8 weeks reduces pain, stiffness, and difficulty with physical function scores by 72%, 62%, and 46%, respectively, when compared to baseline, with improvements superior to placebo for all outcomes (113357).\n\nResearch also shows that taking specific combination products containing turmeric and other ingredients can improve pain and functionality in patients with osteoarthritis. These combination products have combined turmeric with chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride (CartiJoint Forte, Fidia Farmaceutici SpA); boswellic acid (Curamin, EuroPharma USA; Rhulief); Boswellia serrata (Rhulief); ashwagandha, Boswellia serrata, and zinc (Articulin-F, Eisen Pharmaceutical Co. Pvt. Ltd.); devil's claw and bromelain (AINAT, Laboratoire de Rhumatologie Appliquée); Boswellia serrata, guggul, and valerian (Phytoproflex, OPTM Healthcare); Boswellia serrata and terminalia (LI73014F2, Laila Nutraceuticals); ashwagandha, Boswellia serrata, and ginger (Artrex, Mendar); or extracts of ginger rhizome, devil's claw tuber, Boswellia serrata resin, and celery seed (Tregocel, Max Biocare) (19276, 51950, 81466, 89717, 89719, 96127, 97419, 97421, 97428, 106078)(109280).\nless\nPruritus. Oral turmeric has been evaluated for the management of pruritus of various etiologies, with promising results.\nClinical research in patients with kidney failure shows that taking turmeric 500 mg orally three times daily for 8 weeks decreases symptoms of uremic pruritus by 1.9-fold when compared with placebo (89724). Also, a small clinical study in patients with sulfur mustard-induced chronic pruritus shows that taking a specific combination product (C3 Complex, Sami Labs LTD) containing curcumin 1 gram plus extract from black pepper or long pepper (Bioperine) daily for 4 weeks reduces pruritus severity and improves quality of life when compared with placebo (81120, 81176).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAlzheimer disease. Neither oral turmeric nor its constituent curcumin appears to improve cognitive function or attenuate cognitive decline in adults with this condition.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 1-4 grams daily for 6 months does not improve mental state examination scores when compared with placebo (17096). Furthermore, a meta-analysis of this study and another small clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that the turmeric group experienced greater cognitive decline when compared with placebo (100261). While this research is limited by small study sizes and heterogeneous patient populations, the current evidence does not support the use of turmeric in patients with this condition.\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Oral turmeric does not seem to improve the healing of peptic or gastric ulcers when compared with placebo or liquid antacids.\nSome clinical research shows that taking turmeric 2 grams three times daily for 8 weeks does not improve the healing of peptic ulcers when compared with placebo in Vietnamese patients (81444). Also, taking powdered turmeric rhizome 250 mg four times daily for 6 weeks seems to be less effective than a liquid aluminum-magnesium-hydroxide antacid for promoting gastric ulcer healing (81284).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Although there has been interest in using topical turmeric for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose.\nAge-related cognitive decline. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly improve cognition in elderly patients experiencing cognitive decline.\nA meta-analysis of three small clinical trials shows that curcumin modestly improves cognition in the elderly (100261). One of these clinical trials shows that taking a specific brand of curcumin (Theracurmin, Theravalues Corp.) 90 mg twice daily for 18 months improves long-term memory and attention when compared with placebo in middle-aged and older adults with or without mild cognitive impairment (96161).\nless\nAmenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral turmeric for amenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose.\nAnkylosing spondylitis. Although there has been interest in using oral turmeric for ankylosing spondylitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose.\nAnxiety. Some clinical research show that oral curcumin reduces symptoms of anxiety.\nA meta-analysis of 8 mostly low-quality clinical studies in adults with anxiety symptoms or an anxiety disorder diagnosis shows that taking curcumin 500-1000 mg daily for up to 12 weeks modestly reduces symptoms of anxiety when compared with placebo (114902). The validity of the meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, including differences in the patient populations, form and doses curcumin, treatment durations, and types of anxiety scales used. Additionally, all studies were conducted in either Iran or Australia which may limit generalizability of results to other populations.\nless\nAromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia.\nA small clinical trial in patients experiencing aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia shows that taking curcuminoids as a nanoemulsion (Curcumin C3 Complex, Sabinsa Corporation) 200 mg daily for 3 months does not improve grip strength or joint symptoms when compared with placebo (113345). However, this study may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nAsthma. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral turmeric, as an adjunct to conventional asthma treatment, does not improve lung function or symptoms in adults and children with asthma.\nOne small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate asthma shows that adjuvant therapy with turmeric as curcumin 500 mg twice daily for 30 days does not improve lung function based on FEV1, or improve symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, cough, or tightness, when compared to standard treatment alone (99349). A small clinical trial in children 7-18 years of age with moderate to severe asthma shows that adding turmeric 500-1000 mg (containing 20-40 mg curcuminoids) daily for 6 months to standard therapy does not improve overall asthma symptoms when compared with placebo and standard therapy, although it may decrease the frequency of nighttime awakenings and the use of rescue inhalers (99348). Due to their small sizes and high drop-out rates, these studies may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for athletic performance.\nPreliminary clinical research in middle-aged male long-distance runners shows that taking a turmeric extract providing 2 grams of curcumin 95% and piperine 5% daily for 6 weeks does not improve aerobic capacity when compared with placebo (109286).\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial in BPH.\nA clinical study in patients with BPH shows that taking curcumin 2250 mg once daily along with tamsulosin and finasteride for 6 months improves lower urinary tract symptoms related to storage, but not overall symptoms or symptoms related to voiding, by about 35%, compared with 25% in those receiving tamsulosin and finasteride alone. Periprostatic fat thickness, quality of life, and erectile function also were improved (106799).\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for iron overload in patients with beta-thalassemia.\nA small clinical study in patients with beta-thalassemia major and iron overload shows that taking turmeric extract containing curcumin 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) by 0.6 micromol/L, but not hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, or hepcidin, when compared with placebo (99306). Another small clinical study in adult males with beta-thalassemia intermedia and iron overload shows that taking a higher dose of curcumin 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces serum iron and ferritin turmeric levels and transferrin saturation when compared with placebo (108871).\nless\nBruises. Although there has been interest in using topical turmeric to alleviate bruising, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose.\nCachexia. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for cancer cachexia.\nA small clinical trial in patients with cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome shows that taking curcumin 800 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not reduce weight loss or improve body composition or handgrip strength when compared with placebo (109283).\nless\nCanker sores. Some preliminary research suggests that topical curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for minor canker sores.\nPreliminary clinical research in young adults with minor canker sores shows that applying a 2% curcumin oral gel for 6 months reduces ulcer size, pain, and recurrence rate and increases healing rate similarly to 0.1% triamcinolone oral paste (104962). The validity of the study is limited by a lack of investigator blinding and the lack of an intention to treat analysis. Another small clinical study shows that applying a 1% curcumin nanomicelle gel (SinaCurcumin Pharmaceuticals) on lesions three times daily for one week is modestly more effective than applying a 2% curcumin gel for reducing pain and ulcer size (109282). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a non-curcumin comparator group.\nless\nCarpal tunnel syndrome. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. It is unclear if topical curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing turmeric, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylserine, and vitamins C, E, B1, B2, B6, and B12 twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function when compared with control (111702). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. The study may also be inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nTopical turmeric has also been investigated. A small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that applying a 1% curcuminoid gel (Sinanomin) to the wrists twice daily for 8 weeks modestly decreases symptom severity and improves function when compared with a placebo gel. However, there was no change in electrodiagnostic testing of the injury. All patients also used a night splint (113356).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced acral erythema. It is unclear if oral or topical turmeric reduces the risk for acral erythema from capecitabine.\nA small clinical trial in adults with cancer shows that taking turmeric 4 grams daily for 6 weeks starting at the beginning of treatment with capecitabine does not reduce the incidence of acral erythema overall; however, it does seem to reduce acral erythema grade 2 or higher when compared with expected incidence rates (99309).\n\nTopical turmeric has also been evaluated. A clinical study in patients with colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, or breast cancer receiving capecitabine shows that applying a specific ointment (Alpha) standardized to contain curcumin extract 0.5% and henna extract 10% to the soles and palms twice daily, beginning on day 1 of chemotherapy and continued for 4 cycles, does not prevent acral erythema or improve World Health Organization severity scores when compared with placebo. A post-hoc analysis suggests that there may have been a trend toward delayed onset and progression; however, this study was not structured to assess these outcomes (108874).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.\nA small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks does not reduce symptoms of diarrhea when compared with placebo (107111).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces CINV.\nA small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks modestly reduces symptoms of nausea, but not vomiting, in the second and third months after the start of treatment when compared with placebo (107111).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.\nA small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks modestly reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy over a three-month period when compared with placebo (107111).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for CKD.\nA meta-analysis of four small clinical trials in patients with CKD related to diabetic nephropathy or lupus nephritis shows that taking curcumin or turmeric for 0.5-4 months moderately reduces proteinuria when compared with placebo (109276). Also, a small clinical trial in children and young adults ages 6-25 years with vascular dysfunction related to autosomal dominant polycystic disease (PKD) shows that curcumin powder 25 mg/kg daily for 12 months does not improve vascular function or kidney function when compared with placebo (107117).\nless\nColorectal adenoma. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for managing colorectal adenoma.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with familial adenomatous polyposis shows that taking curcumin 1500 mg twice daily for 12 months does not reduce the quantity or size of lower intestinal adenomatous polyps when compared with placebo (97427). A very small clinical trial in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis shows that taking 8 capsules daily of a turmeric extract, in a formulation also containing pepper fruit, spirulina, seaweed, and ginger root, for 6 months does not affect total polyp number or burden when compared with placebo. However, both number and burden were modestly reduced in the left colon. Each capsule provided curcuminoids 123.65 mg and turmerones 26.79 mg (110223).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer.\nA small clinical trial in patients undergoing chemotherapy following colorectal cancer surgery shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly improves some measures of quality of life when compared with placebo (107109). In addition, a small clinical study in people at high risk for colorectal cancer, such as those who smoke, shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 4 grams daily for 30 days can reduce the number of precancerous rectal aberrant crypt foci (18204). It is not clear if this results in a reduced risk for colorectal cancer.\nless\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. One small study suggests that oral turmeric may reduce the risk for myocardial infarction after CABG surgery.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcuminoids, 4 grams daily in four divided doses, beginning 3 days prior to surgery and continuing for 5 days post-surgery, decreases the relative risk of myocardial infarction following CABG by approximately 56% when compared with placebo (81143).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral turmeric or its constituent, curcumin, is beneficial for reducing symptoms of COVID-19.\nSmall studies have evaluated curcumin as an adjunctive therapy in adults hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. Patients in these studies also received treatments such as antimicrobials, anti-inflammatory medications, anticoagulants, antiretrovirals, and immunosuppressants (104966, 105393, 107119). One study shows that adding curcumin reduces the duration of shortness of breath by 6-9 days when compared with patients who received other treatments in combination with probiotics. However, there were no differences in the duration of other symptoms, including fever, cough, or sore throat. Subgroup analyses suggest that taking curcumin may improve oxygenation and reduce the need for supplemental oxygen or ventilation (105393). Another study shows that adding curcumin modestly reduces the time to resolution of COVID-19 symptoms, the length of supplemental oxygen use, and the likelihood for deterioration in the patients' condition when compared with patients who received other treatments alone (104966). A third study shows some benefit of curcumin on fever and cough when compared with baseline; however, it is unclear if any changes were significant when compared with placebo (107119). Doses of curcumin used in these studies include curcumin 525 mg with piperine 2.5 mg (C3 Complex, SamiDirect) twice daily, starting at admission and continuing for 14 days (105393), or a specific nanocurcumin product (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 2 weeks or 240 mg daily in divided doses for 7 days (104966, 107119). Limitations of these studies include the small number of patients with severe symptoms, the large number of outcomes evaluated, the inconsistencies in other treatments used, the lack of clarity related to presentation of some results, and, in most cases, a lack of blinding.\n\nTurmeric has also been evaluated in adults in the outpatient setting with suspected or confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19. One small clinical study shows that taking curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 14 days in addition to other COVID-19 treatments (mainly hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) reduces the duration of cough, chills, myalgia, and smell and taste disturbance, but not dyspnea, fever, sore throat, or others, by 1-2 days when compared with placebo with other treatments (106802). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of confirmatory diagnosis at baseline and lack of consistency with other treatments, as well as the unclear reporting of symptom duration in relation to the initiation of treatment. Another small clinical study in outpatients confirmed to have COVID-19 shows that taking curcumin 1000 mg plus piperine 10 mg (Sami Labs Limited) daily for 14 days modestly improves weakness, but not cough, pain, headache, difficulty breathing, or biochemical indices, when compared with placebo (109278). However, a clinical study in adults with confirmed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 shows that taking curcumin (curcuRouge®, TheraBioPharma) 360 mg twice daily for 7 days within 5 days of COVID-19 diagnosis does not reduce the risk of fever or oxygen saturation below 96% when compared with placebo (114905).\n\nSome research has also examined the effect of turmeric as part of a polyherbal combination. Clinical research in patients hospitalized for moderate COVID-19 symptoms shows that using an Ayurvedic formulation 1776 mg twice daily containing turmeric, ashwagandha, ginger, and Boswellia serrata (BV-4051) for 14 days modestly reduces the duration of illness and reduces the severity of fever, cough, and smell and taste dysfunction when compared to placebo. There was no beneficial effect on other symptoms, including nasal congestion, breathing difficulty, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More than half of the patients were also treated with remdesivir which did not impact the majority of these findings (109899).\nless\nCrohn disease. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for improving symptoms of active Crohn disease.\nSome clinical research shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 1.08 grams daily for one month, then 1.44 grams daily for one month, can reduce bowel movements, diarrhea, and abdominal pain when compared to baseline in patients with Crohn disease (79730). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nDenture stomatitis. Topical turmeric may be beneficial for treating denture stomatitis.\nA small clinical study in patients with denture stomatitis shows that applying topical curcumin gel (Curenext, Abbott Laboratories) three times daily for 2 weeks resolves denture stomatitis lesions similarly to clotrimazole ointment (106797).\nless\nDiabetes. Lower quality clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials in patients with diabetic kidney disease shows that curcumin reduces levels of fasting glucose by approximately 8.3 mg/dL when compared with placebo. Curcumin was used in doses of 66.3-1670 mg daily for 2-6 months (107114). Preliminary clinical research included in the analysis shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by about 20 mg/dL (104149). Other meta-analyses of low- to moderate-quality clinical studies in patients with a variety of conditions including type 2 diabetes show that taking turmeric extract, curcumin, or curcuminoids for 4-36 weeks improves glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.4-0.7% and reduces fasting glucose by approximately 13 mg/dL when compared with placebo or conventional treatment (106806, 108877, 113604). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and broad curcuminoid doses ranging from 46-1500 mg daily. Conversely, other meta-analyses in patients with type 2 diabetes show that curcumin does not reduce HbA1c or insulin levels when compared with placebo (104965, 108877, 113604).\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with grade 3 diabetic foot ulcers shows that taking nanocurcumin 80 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or change the rate of ulcer healing when compared with placebo. Taking turmeric did result in modest decreases in fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance (104972).\nless\nDiabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with diabetic nephropathy.\nMeta-analyses of two to four small clinical trials in patients with diabetic kidney disease show that curcumin modestly improves serum levels of creatinine, total cholesterol, and fasting glucose, and reduces systolic blood pressure by 4 mmHg, when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on diastolic blood pressure, proteinuria, or serum levels of other plasma lipids or blood urea nitrogen. Curcumin was used in doses of 66.3-1670 mg daily for 2-6 months (107114). One small study included in this analysis, which evaluated patients receiving hemodialysis, shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by about 20 mg/dL when compared with placebo (104149).\nless\nDry eye. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in adults with dry eye disease shows that taking a combination supplement containing curcumin extract that provides 200 mg curcuminoids plus lutein, vitamin D3, and zeaxanthin daily for 8 weeks improves tear production and overall patient-reported symptoms (e.g., burning or sore eyes, blurred vision, difficulty reading) when compared with placebo (116214). However, the clinical significance is unclear, and the use of artificial tears did not differ between groups. It is unclear if these benefits are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in university students aged 18 to 24 in Iran with mild to severe primary dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) shows that taking a specific combination product containing curcumin 500 mg plus extract from black pepper 5 mg (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) daily, starting 7 days prior to menstruation and continuing for 3 days after menstruation for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles, does not improve the severity of symptoms when compared with placebo (106805). Conversely, a small clinical study in adults with moderately painful dysmenorrhea shows that taking a single dose of a combination product containing turmeric, Boswellia serrata, and sesame (Rhuleave-K, Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) 1000 mg at the start of menstruation relieves menstrual cramp pain and reduces pain intensity for up to 6 hours when compared with placebo (112806). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nEndometriosis. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for reducing pain due to endometriosis.\nA small clinical study in adults with endometriosis shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not affect pain associated with endometriosis or quality of life when compared with placebo (113603).\nless\nErythema. Although there has been interest in using topical turmeric for reducing erythema, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose.\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for reducing muscle damage from exercise.\nA meta-analysis of 12 small, lower-quality clinical studies in adults shows that taking curcumin 150-500 mg as a single dose before or after exercise or 180-5000 mg daily for up to 56 days reduces markers of muscle damage (i.e. serum creatine kinase levels) when compared with placebo. Curcumin seems most beneficial for this effect in untrained adults and when administered as a single dose. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 3 of these clinical studies shows that curcumin improves range of motion (114897). The interpretation of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity.\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral turmeric or its constituent, curcumin, is beneficial for reducing muscle soreness from exercise.\nA meta-analysis of 12 small, lower-quality clinical studies in trained and untrained adults shows that taking curcumin 150-500 mg as a single dose before or after exercise or 180-5000 mg daily for up to 56 days time reduces muscle soreness when compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis indicated that the largest effect size is observed at 96 hours post-exercise with progressively smaller effect sizes at earlier time points (114897). The interpretation of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity.\n\nTurmeric has also been examined in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research in healthy active adults with moderate to severe exercise-induced muscle pain shows that taking a single, 1000-mg dose of turmeric and Boswellia serrata extracts in black sesame oil (Rhuleave-K; Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) improves pain relief when compared with placebo, with maximal benefits within about 3 hours. The number of people needed to treat to obtain pain relief of at least 50% over a 6-hour period was 1.1 (109277).\nless\nGingivitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral turmeric and turmeric mouthwash may reduce the severity of gingivitis. Turmeric mouthwash appears to be similarly effective to chlorhexidine mouthwash.\nA meta-analysis of generally preliminary clinical research shows that rinsing with a mouthwash containing curcumin for 3-4 weeks is as effective as rinsing with chlorhexidine for reducing the severity of gingivitis or plaque (106059). Mouthwashes in these studies contained 0.05% to 20% curcumin and were usually used twice daily for 3-4 weeks (81127, 89723, 106059). One mouthwash contained 0.05% turmeric extract and 0.005% eugenol (89723). Another small clinical trial shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily by mouth after breakfast for 4 weeks reduces the severity of gingivitis and gingival bleeding, but not plaque, when compared with placebo in patients with gingivitis and mild periodontitis (104146).\nless\nGout. Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for gout, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this condition.\nGulf war syndrome. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with Gulf war syndrome.\nA small preliminary clinical trial in patients with Gulf war syndrome shows that taking curcumin (Meriva, Indena, S.p.A.) 500 mg twice daily for 30 days reduces overall symptoms, including pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, and others, by 19% when compared with baseline. Taking a higher dose of 2000 mg twice daily for an additional 30 days appears to be no more effective than the lower dose (105395).\nless\nHearing loss. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for treating hearing loss.\nA small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate hearing impairment shows that taking curcumin 500 mg daily for 12 weeks improves some measures of auditory function, such as auditory brain stem response threshold, when compared with placebo (114906).\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Small clinical studies suggest that oral turmeric is not beneficial for eradicating H. pylori when used alone or in combination with standard triple therapy or famotidine.\nOne small clinical study in patients with H. pylori gastritis shows that taking turmeric 2.1 grams daily for 4 weeks is less effective for eradicating H. pylori than taking an omeprazole-based triple regimen for one week (80957). Another small study in adults with peptic ulcers shows that taking a specific curcumin product (C3 Complex, Sami Labs LTD) 500 mg daily for 7 days, in conjunction with standard triple therapy, does not improve H. pylori eradication rates when compared with standard triple therapy alone. The addition of curcumin increased the resolution of dyspepsia symptoms by an additional 21%, but the clinical significance of this outcome is unclear (97420). In patients with dyspepsia, most of whom tested positive for fecal H. pylori antigen, clinical research shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily in addition to famotidine 40 mg daily for 30 days is no more effective for reducing fecal H. pylori antigen levels than taking famotidine alone (106063).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with hypertension.\nA meta-analysis of approximately 30 clinical studies in healthy adults or patients with a variety of conditions shows that taking turmeric, curcumin, curcuminoids, or nano-curcumin for 4 to 24 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by about 2 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by about 0.8 mmHg when compared with placebo (113602). However, these blood pressure reductions may not be clinically meaningful. In addition, most of the included studies were small and utilized heterogeneous dosing regimens.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Oral turmeric may modestly improve glucose control in some patients with prediabetes.\nIn overweight or obese individuals with prediabetes, clinical research shows that taking a turmeric extract (BCM95 or Cucugreen; M/s Arjuna Natural Pvt Ltd.) 500 mg daily, providing 95% curcuminoids and at least 65% curcumin, for 90 days, either alone or in combination with zinc 30 mg as zinc gluconate, results in a small reduction in fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo. There was also a small benefit in insulin sensitivity (105391). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with prediabetes shows that taking 500 mg of a combination of turmeric extract and Indian gooseberry extract in a 1:2 ratio along with phosphatidylcholine (EmbliQur) twice daily for 6 months modestly reduces fasting glucose and improves insulin resistance, when compared with placebo. However, changes in most other endpoints were not significantly different from placebo. Each 500 mg capsule contained turmeric extracts 29.86% and turmeric oil 1.27% (113355).\n\nThe effect of turmeric on progression to type 2 diabetes in patients with prediabetes has also been investigated. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a turmeric extract containing curcumin 750 mg twice daily for 9 months reduces the percentage of patients with prediabetes who develop type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo (81163).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for improving symptoms of IBS.\nPreliminary clinical research in otherwise healthy adults with IBS shows that taking a turmeric extract (Cynara Turmeric, Lichtwer Pharma) 72-144 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces IBS symptoms by about 40% to 60% when compared to baseline (79565). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Taking a combination product (CU-FEO, Alfa Wasserman S.p.A.) containing curcumin 42 mg and fennel essential oil 25 mg per capsule twice daily for 60 days improves overall ratings of abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and quality of life by 24% when compared with placebo (97422). It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, fennel, or the combination. Observational research suggests that adding a supplement (Enterofytol PLUS) providing curcumin 42 mg and berberine 200 mg twice daily for 2 months to conventional IBS treatment is associated with improvements in symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, distension, and stool status, by up to 48% when compared with conventional treatment alone. Use of the supplement was also associated with a 64% reduced need for conventional treatments (113354).\nless\nJoint pain. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking capsules of a specific combination product (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital) containing glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg, methylsulfonylmethane 500 mg, white willow bark extract 250 mg, ginger root concentrate 50 mg, Boswellia extract 125 mg, turmeric root extract 50 mg, cayenne 40 m H.U. 50 mg, and hyaluronic acid 4 mg in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain severity by 37% compared to only 16% with placebo. However, it does not improve joint stiffness or function when compared with placebo (89560). It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for JIA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this condition.\nKnee pain. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for knee pain.\nClinical research in individuals with knee pain not related to existing arthritis shows that taking turmeric extract (TurmXTRA 60N; Inventia Healthcare Ltd. and Laila Nutraceuticals) 250 mg, providing 60% curcuminoids, once daily for 90 days modestly reduces pain associated with walking 80 meters when compared with placebo. The time taken to walk 80 meters and to climb nine steps was reduced by 4-5 seconds (105396).\nless\nLichen planus. Evidence is conflicting on whether turmeric is beneficial for lichen planus.\nA meta-analysis of several small, heterogeneous, mostly low-quality clinical and observational studies in adults with oral lichen planus shows that oral or topical curcumin with or without corticosteroids for 2-12 weeks does not improve erythema, lesion size, or pain when compared with control (113605). Similarly, a network meta-analysis of small clinical trials in patients with oral lichen planus shows that applying topical turmeric gel does not improve symptoms, clinical resolution, clinical scores, or reduce pain when compared with other available interventions (111640).\n\nHowever, small individual clinical studies have shown some benefit in using turmeric orally or topically for lichen planus. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific turmeric extract (Curcumin C3 Complex, Sabinsa Corporation) containing curcuminoids 6000 mg daily in three divided doses for 12 days can reduce erythema and ulceration associated with lichen planus when compared with placebo (81109). Another small clinical study shows that taking a nanocurcumin product (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg orally once daily for 1 month reduces oral lichen planus lesion size, pain, and burning similarly to prednisolone 10 mg taken orally once daily for 1 month (104961). Additionally, a small clinical study shows that applying turmeric twice daily for 4 months reduces burning, pain, and lesion size when compared to baseline. Turmeric reduces these outcomes similarly to topical ashwagandha or aloe vera (115931).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nResearch is conflicting on how turmeric, curcumin, and other formulations affect various measures of metabolic syndrome. Some clinical research and a meta-analysis of 13 clinical studies in patients with metabolic syndrome show that taking turmeric or curcumin decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, waist circumference by 2 cm, fasting blood glucose by 9 mg/dL, and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL when compared with placebo. However, other research shows that turmeric or curcumin have no effect on body weight, lipids, blood pressure, or blood glucose when compared with placebo (98999, 99311, 105400, 109284, 111347, 112118). The validity of these effects is limited by high heterogeneity within the included studies and incomplete information about randomization and blinding.\n\nStudies have used turmeric, curcumin, and curcumin extract 80-2400 mg, in divided doses, daily for 4-12 weeks, nano-curcumin 80 mg daily for 12 weeks, or calebin A (CurCousin, Sabinsa), which is a constituent of turmeric, 25 mg twice daily for 3 months (98999, 99311, 105400, 109284, 111347, 112118). Also, taking crude or phosphorylated curcuminoids 1 gram daily for 6 weeks does not improve sleep or reduce weight in these patients (105397).\nless\nMigraine headache. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial for migraine headache.\nA small clinical trial in females with regular migraines shows that taking curcumin 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces the severity and duration, but not the frequency, of migraine headaches when compared with placebo. In individuals taking curcumin, the duration of headache per month was reduced by approximately 10.3 hours from baseline (107116).\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial for reducing myocardial injury following a MI.\nClinical research in patients with an acute MI shows that taking curcuminoids 500 mg plus piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily (Sami Labs) for 8 weeks does not improve ejection fraction, serum levels of cardiac troponin 1, blood pressure, levels of fasting blood glucose, or kidney function parameters when compared to placebo. However, there were some modest benefits on levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and certain liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (107115). The validity of this study is limited by its short duration and relatively small sample size.\nless\nObesity. Oral turmeric might modestly improve weight loss, although any effect is unlikely to be clinically significant.\nMultiple meta-analyses of small, mostly low-quality clinical studies in adults with a variety of comorbid conditions show that taking various forms and doses of turmeric or curcumin results in an average weight loss of about 0.6-1 kg, a decrease in body mass index (BMI) of about 0.2-0.5 kg/m2, and a decrease in waist circumference of about 1.3 cm when compared with control (102345, 111351, 111352). A sub-analysis of dose and duration shows that a reduction in waist circumference only occurs with curcumin daily doses above 1000 mg, and duration of treatment longer than 8 weeks (102345).\nless\nOral submucous fibrosis. Small studies suggest that topical or oral curcumin might be beneficial for oral submucous fibrosis. However, the research is heterogenous with respect to outcomes, comparators, and the turmeric preparations, doses, and routes of administration utilized.\nA meta-analysis of 3 small clinical trials shows that turmeric modestly improves mouth opening when compared with control. In addition, a systematic review of 11 studies shows that turmeric improves overall symptoms, including mouth opening, tongue protrusion, burning sensation, and cheek flexibility. However, studies were small with short duration and used variable dosing strategies. Most trials have studied oral turmeric 300-400 mg, either alone or with black pepper 100 mg or piperine 5 mg, for 3-6 months. Less commonly, turmeric was provided in lozenge form (105399). Also, a network meta-analysis suggests that the turmeric constituent curcumin with or without piperine is most the effective for reducing tongue protrusion when compared indirectly with various medical and antioxidant therapies; however, this analysis suggests that curcumin does not rank among the most effective interventions for improving mouth opening, burning sensation, or cheek flexibility (113514).\n\nOther preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific oral product containing curcumin 300 mg and piperine 5 mg (Turmix tablets, Sanat Products), three times daily for 12 weeks, improves mouth opening, burning sensation, and tongue protrusion when compared with baseline, but not when compared with an antioxidant product containing alpha-lipoic acid, beta-carotene, copper, lycopene, selenium, and zinc. Mouth opening is further improved by concurrent use of a mouthwash (Turmix mouthwash, Sanat Products), containing 0.1% w/v turmeric extract (standardized to 95% curcumin), with thymol, eucalyptol, clove oil, mentha oil, and tea tree oil, twice daily for 12 weeks (102347). A small clinical study shows that applying topical curcumin gel (Curenext, Abbott Laboratories) 5 mg daily in 3-4 divided doses for 6 weeks, in combination with oral physical therapy, improves mouth opening similarly to using an aloe vera gel in combination with oral physical therapy. However, decreases in burning sensation are greater with aloe gel than curcumin gel (104967). It is not clear whether the gels, oral physical therapy, or the combination of both is responsible for the outcome. Finally, clinical research shows that applying a paste providing turmeric and holy basil 10 grams each, mixed in 10 mL of honey, to the oral mucosa 4 times daily for 3 months modestly improves mouth opening, tongue protrusion, and burning sensation and reduces the presence of fibrous bands when compared with taking a vitamin B supplement. There was no effect on the shape of the uvula (113325).\nless\nPain (acute). Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with acute musculoskeletal pain shows that taking a specific combination product containing turmeric and Boswellia serrata extracts in black sesame oil (Rhuleave-K; Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) 1000 mg daily for 7 days is as effective as acetaminophen 1000 mg daily for pain relief, onset of pain relief, and onset of maximal pain relief (109287). This study is limited by its lack of blinding and placebo control. Additionally, the dose of acetaminophen used in this study is below the standard recommended daily dose.\nless\nPeriodontitis. There is limited evidence on the oral or topical use of turmeric or its constituent curcumin in patients with periodontitis.\nA meta-analysis of heterogenous clinical studies in patients with chronic periodontitis suggests that use of local delivery gel products, usually turmeric 2% or a specific product containing curcumin (Curenext), modestly reduces pocket depth when compared with routine products, such as chlorhexidine. However, limited research suggests that curcumin products do not affect plaque or gingivitis measures, and curcumin irrigation does not affect pocket depth based on limited research (107108). A small preliminary clinical study in patients with severe chronic periodontitis shows that placing curcumin gel 2 mg on one side of the mouth along with scaling and root planing (SRP) reduces plaque and probing pocket depth, but not gingival index, when compared with SRP alone (101339).\n\nThe use of oral curcumin has also been investigated. A small clinical trial in patients with gingivitis and mild periodontitis shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily after breakfast for 4 weeks reduces the severity of gingivitis and gingival bleeding, but not plaque, when compared with placebo (104146).\nless\nPhysical performance. It is unclear if oral turmeric may be beneficial for improving physical performance in older adults.\nA very small clinical study in moderately functioning, sedentary adults over age 65 with low-grade chronic inflammation shows that that taking a specific turmeric extract (Curcumin C3 Complex, Sabinsa Corporation) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve measures of physical function, walking speed, or muscle strength when compared with placebo (111357). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect any possible differences between groups.\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin may improve some metabolic parameters in patients with PCOS, but these improvements may not be considered clinically significant.\nClinical research in patients with PCOS shows that taking curcumin 500 mg one to three times daily for 6-12 weeks improves some metabolic parameters (104968, 105394, 106795). Conversely, a small clinical study in patients aged 18 to 45 with PCOS in Iran shows that taking curcumin 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting glucose but does not improve other metabolic parameters when compared with placebo. Taking curcumin also did not improve testosterone levels or hirsutism scores (111355). Meta-analyses show that taking curcumin modestly decreases body mass index (BMI) and improves measures of glycemic control, including fasting glucose and insulin resistance, and levels of total cholesterol when compared with placebo or metformin alone. However, effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were mixed and there was no effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels (105394, 106795, 110219). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking curcumin decreases plasma dehydroepiandrosterone and fasting plasma glucose levels when compared with placebo (104968).\n\nCurcumin has also been evaluated in combination therapy. Some clinical research in adults with PCOS also shows that taking nano-curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80-240 mg daily for 3 months in combination with metformin 1500 mg daily modestly improves some metabolic parameters including fasting insulin, insulin resistance, as well as HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with metformin alone or placebo alone (106060, 116944). Furthermore, combination therapy with metformin also showed slight improvements in fasting blood glucose and body weight when compared with placebo (116944). Clinical research in patients with PCOS shows that taking curcumin 500 mg one to three times daily for 6-12 weeks improves some metabolic parameters (104968, 105394, 106795). Conversely, a small clinical study in patients aged 18 to 45 with PCOS in Iran shows that taking curcumin 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting glucose but does not improve other metabolic parameters when compared with placebo. Taking curcumin also did not improve testosterone levels or hirsutism scores (111355). Meta-analyses show that taking curcumin modestly decreases body mass index (BMI) and improves measures of glycemic control, including fasting glucose and insulin resistance, and levels of total cholesterol when compared with placebo or metformin alone. However, effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were mixed and there was no effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels (105394, 106795, 110219). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking curcumin decreases plasma dehydroepiandrosterone and fasting plasma glucose levels when compared with placebo (104968).\nless\nPostoperative pain. Small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly reduce pain in various postoperative recovery settings.\nOne small clinical study in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy shows that taking curcumin 2 grams daily reduces postoperative pain, fatigue, and the need for analgesics by the second postoperative week when compared with placebo (81099). In patients undergoing surgery for inguinal hernia and/or hydrocele, taking curcumin 1.2 grams daily for 5 days reduces inflammation and tenderness by the sixth postoperative day when compared with placebo (81206). Curcumin was taken in 3-4 divided doses daily in these studies. Finally, taking a single dose of curcumin 200 mg after surgical removal of impacted third molars modestly reduces acute postoperative pain when compared with taking mefenamic acid 500 mg (99305).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral turmeric may be beneficial for improving symptoms of PMS.\nSome preliminary clinical research in patients with PMS shows that taking curcumin 100 mg twice daily, starting 7 days prior to menstruation and continuing for 3 days after menstruation, improves physical, behavioral, and mood symptoms, as well as overall severity of symptoms, when compared with placebo (97433). Conversely, in university students aged 18 to 24 in Iran with mild to severe PMS and primary dysmenorrhea, a clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product containing curcumin 500 mg plus extract from black pepper 5 mg (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) daily, starting 7 days prior to menstruation and continuing for 3 days after menstruation for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles, does not improve the severity of symptoms when compared with placebo (106805).\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking curcumin 1.8 grams orally three times daily for 7 days, starting 4 days prior to docetaxel and prednisone treatment and continuing for up to 6 cycles, reduces PSA levels by at least half in 59% of patients when compared to baseline. Also, all patients with measurable lesions showed at least stable disease after treatment, and 40% of patients showed partial response when compared with baseline (96132). It is unclear if the addition of turmeric is beneficial when compared with docetaxel and prednisone alone. In contrast, an additional small clinical trial shows that taking curcumin 6 grams daily for 7 days every 3 weeks, starting four days before docetaxel, does not improve PSA levels or progression-free or overall survival when compared with docetaxel alone (105392).\nless\nPsoriasis. Evidence is limited to one small study of topical use in patients with scalp psoriasis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with scalp psoriasis shows that applying a tonic of turmeric to the scalp twice daily for 9 weeks modestly improves overall symptoms and quality of life when compared with a placebo tonic (97429).\nless\nQuality of life. Some preliminary clinical research suggests that oral curcumin might improve quality of life in patients with various chronic conditions.\nSmall or low-quality clinical trials in various patient populations show that taking curcumin improves at least some measures of quality of life when compared with placebo. Research has been conducted in patients with cancer, sulfur mustard-induced chronic pruritus, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Studies have evaluated curcumin 2250 mg once daily for 6 months, a specific combination product (C3 Complex, Sami Labs LTD) containing curcumin 500-1000 mg plus piperine (Bioperine) daily for 4-9 weeks, or a combination product (CU-FEO, Alfa Wasserman S.p.A.) containing curcumin 42 mg and fennel essential oil 25 mg per capsule twice daily for 60 days (81120, 81176, 97422, 106799, 107109, 107111). Also, in patients with scalp psoriasis, applying a tonic of turmeric to the scalp twice daily for 9 weeks modestly improves quality of life when compared with a placebo tonic (97429).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if oral or topical turmeric is beneficial for reducing the severity of radiation dermatitis.\nA meta-analysis of 4 clinical studies in patients with breast cancer shows that taking curcumin 500-2000 mg three times daily for 3-7 weeks or applying curcumin gel 500 mg three times daily for 7 weeks reduces the radiation dermatitis severity score by about 0.5 points (on a 4-point scale) when compared with placebo or other control (111354). The validity of this analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. However, a small clinical study in patients with breast cancer shows that taking nanocurcumin 80 mg twice daily during and for up to 2 weeks after treatment does not reduce skin reaction severity overall, but does modestly reduce pain, when compared with taking placebo. Also, there was a small reduction in skin reaction severity near the end of the study. All patients also used aloe vera leaf as part of the hospital protocol (109281). Another small preliminary clinical study in head and neck cancer patients shows that a specific cream (Vicco turmeric cream, Vicco Laboratories) containing turmeric and sandalwood oil, applied 5 times daily during radiation therapy, seems to reduce frequency and severity of radiation dermatitis when compared with baby oil (99307).\nless\nRadiation proctopathy. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for preventing proctitis or cystitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for prostate cancer.\nA small clinical study in patients with prostate cancer shows that taking a specific nanocurcumin product (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 120 mg daily, for 3 days before and also during a course of radiotherapy, does not reduce the occurrence of proctitis or cystitis when compared with placebo (100259). This study may have been underpowered to detect small treatment effects.\nless\nRespiratory tract infections. Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for various respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and the common cold, it has not been clinically evaluated.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly improve some symptoms of RA.\nMeta-analyses of small clinical trials in patients with RA show that taking curcumin alone or with other treatments modestly reduces overall RA symptoms, pain, and markers of inflammation when compared with control groups, including placebo or other treatments. However, some research shows that there is no beneficial effect on tender or swollen joint count from the limited available clinical research (109280, 111358), while other research shows that there is a benefit (112117). Clinical studies have evaluated curcumin 120-1200 mg daily for 2 weeks to 3 months (11149, 18205, 96129). The validity of these findings is limited by the small size of the studies, and in some cases, the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nSarcopenia. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in elderly patients with sarcopenia shows that taking a specific slow-release product containing turmeric, protein, carbohydrate, and fiber (Cureit, Aurea Biolabs), 500 mg orally daily for 3 months, increases handgrip strength by about 1% and distance walked before feeling tired by about 6% when compared with placebo. It also increases weightlifting capacity by about 6% from baseline, compared with a 5% decrease from baseline in those taking placebo (104973). It is unclear whether these small changes are clinically meaningful.\nless\nSchizophrenia. Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for improving cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this use.\nSepsis. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial in patients with sepsis.\nA small clinical trial in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis shows that a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina), 80 mg dissolved in water and administered via gastric tube following lavage twice daily for 10 days does not affect length of ICU stay, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, blood pressure, or heart rate when compared with placebo (108873).\nless\nSmoking cessation. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing turmeric 50 mg, ashwagandha, Indian gooseberry, tribulus, bacopa, Albizia lebbeck, licorice, clove, ginger, cowhage, and holy basil (Smotect, Smotect India) daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked by approximately 3 per day when compared with placebo. This product also reduces levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity (112115). However, only data from patients who completed treatment were analyzed, which limits the validity of this study. It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing turmeric 100 mg, ashwagandha, Indian gooseberry, tribulus, bacopa, Albizia lebbeck, licorice, clove, ginger, cowhage, and holy basil (Smotect, Smotect India) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked by approximately 3 per day when compared with placebo. This product also reduces levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity (112115). However, only data from patients who completed treatment were analyzed, which limits the validity of this study. It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nStress. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for reducing occupational stress in healthy adults.\nA small clinical trial in healthy adults with occupational stress-related anxiety and fatigue shows that taking a specific type of turmeric (CurQfen, Akay Flavours and Aromatics Pvt Ltd.) that contains fenugreek dietary fiber for improved bioavailability at a dose of 500 mg twice daily for 30 days reduces stress and fatigue and improves quality of life when compared with placebo, and also when compared with a standard curcumin supplement with lower bioavailability (99308).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for stroke.\nA small clinical study conducted in Iran in adults with a recent ischemic stroke shows that taking curcumin 500 mg and piperine, a pepper constituent, 5 mg (Sami Lans, India) daily for 12 weeks reduces carotid intima-media thickness, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but does not improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or quality-of-life indicators when compared with placebo (113601). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons which can lead studies to erroneously show differences between treatment groups.\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There is limited evidence on the oral use of turmeric in adults with lupus nephritis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with lupus nephritis shows that taking turmeric 1.5 grams daily in three divided doses for 3 months reduces systolic blood pressure and improves kidney function when compared to baseline (81104). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nTuberculosis. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial in patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis.\nA small clinical study in adults receiving antituberculosis treatment shows that taking a formulation containing turmeric 0.5 grams and Tinospora cordifolia 0.5 grams twice daily for 4 months can reduce levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum and improve lesion healing when compared with antituberculosis treatment alone. Also, liver toxicity associated with the antituberculosis treatment seems to be reduced when administered with this formulation (80424). It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, Tinospora cordifolia, or the combination.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral or rectal turmeric, or its constituent, curcumin, is beneficial in adults with ulcerative colitis.\nAlthough two small clinical studies in adults with ulcerative colitis show that taking oral turmeric extract 2-3 grams daily for 1-6 months improves the rate of remission and reduces relapse rate (79966, 97423), a meta-analysis of these studies and one additional clinical study shows that turmeric does not improve remission rates when compared with placebo (99000). A specific product (Cur-Cure, Bara Herbs Inc) was used in some of these studies. Reasons for the conflicting findings are unclear, but may be due to small patient populations, concerns about blinding, and the inclusion of patients who were also taking immunomodulating drugs. It may also be due to differences in how a study measures remission. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis shows that adding oral curcumin 0.5-3 grams daily to standard treatment for 1-6 months may improve clinical remission rates, but not endoscopic remission rates, when compared with placebo (108872). However, the validity of this finding is limited by the small number of studies that evaluated endoscopic remission.\n\nA small clinical study shows that administering an enema form of turmeric extract (NCB-02, Himalaya Drug Company) as 20 mL, containing turmeric extract 140 mg, daily for 8 weeks increases response rate from 50% to about 93% and increases remission rate from about 31% to 71% when compared with placebo in patients with active ulcerative colitis. However, patients using the turmeric extract enema for shorter durations did not improve when compared with placebo (89729). Turmeric has also been investigated in combination with the Mediterranean diet. A small clinical trial shows that taking curcumin (VeNatura Curcumin Supplement) 800 mg twice daily while following the Mediterranean diet for 8 weeks is no more effective for improving ulcerative colitis symptom severity than following the Mediterranean diet without supplemental curcumin (113339).\nless\nUveitis. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial for uveitis.\nObservational research in patients with acute non-infectious uveitic macular edema shows that taking a specific hydrophilic curcumin product (Cucrcuwin, Diabec, Alfa Intes) 60 mg twice daily for 6 months, in conjunction with standard corticosteroid treatment, and then alone for an additional 6 months, modestly improves best corrected visual acuity, but not macular thickness or intraocular pressure, when compared with standard treatment alone for 6 months (107110).\nless\nWound healing. Although there is interest in using topical turmeric for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this condition.\nChemotherapy-induced constipation. It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced constipation.\nA small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks does not reduce symptoms of constipation when compared with placebo (107111).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate turmeric for these uses.",

This extract is used in two products used in clinical research (Curamin and CuraMed). CuraMed contains 552-578 mg of BCM-95 providing 500 mg curcuminoids, 376 mg of curcumin, 124 mg demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, and 49-52 mg volatile oil. Curamin contains 350 mg BCM-95, as well as 150 mg boswellia extract, 75% boswellic acids and 10% 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acid (AKBA) (96127). This extract has also been used in another product (Biocurcumax) (96130).\n\nA specific turmeric extract containing curcumin-galactomannoside complex (CurQfen, standardized to contain not less than 35% of curcuminoids) 500 mg has been used (99308, 106804).\n\nFinally, a specific turmeric rhizome extract (Turmacin, Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd.) is standardized to contain 12.6% polysaccharides (89721).",

Theoretically, this may reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals. However, research is conflicting.\nIn vitro research suggests that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, inhibits mechlorethamine-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells by up to 70%. Also, animal research shows that curcumin inhibits cyclophosphamide-induced tumor regression (96126). However, some in vitro research shows that curcumin does not affect the apoptosis capacity of etoposide. Also, other laboratory research suggests that curcumin might augment the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents. Reasons for the discrepancies may relate to the dose of curcumin and the specific chemotherapeutic agent. Lower doses of curcumin might have antioxidant effects while higher doses might have pro-oxidant effects (96125). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, turmeric might have on alkylating agents.\nless\nAMLODIPINE (Norvasc)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTaking turmeric with amlodipine may increase levels of amlodipine.\nAnimal research shows that giving amlodipine 1 mg/kg as a single dose following the use of turmeric extract 200 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks increases the maximum concentration and area under the curve by 53% and 56%, respectively, when compared with amlodipine alone (107113). Additional animal research shows that taking amlodipine 1 mg/kg with a curcumin 2 mg/kg pretreatment for 10 days increases the maximum concentration and area under the curve by about 2-fold when compared with amlodipine alone (103099).\nless\nANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTurmeric may have antiplatelet effects and may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. However, research is conflicting.\nCurcumin, a constituent of turmeric, has demonstrated antiplatelet effects in vitro (11143, 81204, 81271). Furthermore, two case reports have found that taking turmeric along with warfarin or fluindione was associated with an increased international normalized ratio (INR) (89718, 100906). However, one clinical study in healthy volunteers shows that taking curcumin 500 mg daily for 3 weeks, alone or with aspirin 100 mg, does not increase antiplatelet effects or bleeding risk (96137). It is possible that the dose of turmeric used in this study was too low to produce a notable effect.\nless\nANTIDIABETES DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, taking turmeric with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia.\nAnimal research and case reports suggest that curcumin, a turmeric constituent, can reduce blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes (79692, 79984, 80155, 80313, 80315, 80476, 80553, 81048, 81219). Furthermore, clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking curcumin 475 mg daily for 10 days prior to taking glyburide 5 mg decreased postprandial glucose levels for up to 24 hours when compared with glyburide alone, despite the lack of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction (96133). Other clinical studies in patients with diabetes show that taking curcumin daily can reduce blood glucose levels when compared with placebo (104149, 114898, 114900).\nless\nANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTurmeric has antioxidant effects.

However, research is conflicting.\nIn vitro and animal research shows that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, inhibits doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells by up to 65% (96126). However, curcumin does not seem to affect the apoptosis capacity of daunorubicin. In fact, some research shows that curcumin might augment the cytotoxic effects of antitumor antibiotics, increasing their effectiveness. Reasons for the discrepancies may relate to the dose of curcumin and the chemotherapeutic agent. Lower doses of curcumin might have antioxidant effects while higher doses might have pro-oxidant effects (96125). More evidence is needed to determine what effects, if any, antioxidants such as turmeric have on antitumor antibiotics.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, turmeric might increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A1. However, research is conflicting.\nMost in vitro and animal research suggests that the turmeric constituent, curcumin, INHIBITS CYP1A1, primarily in the liver (15823, 21495, 80876, 81411). However, some evidence from in vitro research suggests that curcumin may INDUCE CYP1A1 in the intestines (21500).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, turmeric might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2. However, research is conflicting.\nIn vitro and animal research show that the turmeric constituent, curcumin, inhibits CYP1A2 (15823, 21497, 81304). However, other in vitro research suggests that curcumin does not significantly affect CYP1A2 (22000).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTurmeric might increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.\nIn vitro and animal research show that turmeric and its constituents curcumin and curcuminoids inhibit CYP3A4 (21497, 21498, 21499). Also, 8 case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking turmeric and cancer medications that are CYP3A4 substrates, including everolimus, ruxolitinib, ibrutinib, and palbociclib, and bortezomib (111644). In another case report, a transplant patient presented with acute nephrotoxicity and elevated tacrolimus levels after consuming turmeric powder at a dose of 15 or more spoonfuls daily for ten days prior. It was thought that turmeric increased levels of tacrolimus due to CYP3A4 inhibition (93544).\n\nConversely, other in vitro research suggests that turmeric induces CYP3A4 activity, leading to reduced levels of CYP3A4 substrates (111404). An animal model suggests that induction of CYP3A4 occurs after daily curcumin use for 1 week (116945). However, the induction of CYP3A4 by turmeric has not been reported in humans.\nless\nDOCETAXEL (Taxotere)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, turmeric might increase blood levels of oral docetaxel.\nAnimal research suggests that the turmeric constituent, curcumin, enhances the oral bioavailability of docetaxel (80999).

While maximal blood concentrations of glyburide were not affected, turmeric modestly decreased postprandial glucose levels for up to 24 hours when compared to glyburide alone, possibly due to the hypoglycemic effect of turmeric demonstrated in animal research (96133).\nless\nHEPATOTOXIC DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, turmeric might increase the risk of liver damage when taken with hepatotoxic drugs.\nThere is concern that turmeric might cause hepatotoxicity, especially when highly bioavailable formulations are used in high doses (103633, 107122, 109288, 110221).\nless\nLOSARTAN (Cozaar)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, turmeric might increase the effects of losartan.\nResearch in hypertensive rats shows that taking turmeric can increase the hypotensive effects of losartan (110897).\nless\nMETHOTREXATE (Trexall, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, turmeric might have additive effects when used with hepatotoxic drugs such as methotrexate.\nIn one case report, a 39-year-old female taking methotrexate, turmeric, and linseed oil developed hepatotoxicity (111644).\nless\nNORFLOXACIN (Noroxin)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, turmeric might increase the effects and adverse effects of norfloxacin.\nAnimal research shows that taking curcumin, a turmeric constituent, can increase blood levels of orally administered norfloxacin (80863).\nless\nORGANIC ANION-TRANSPORTING POLYPEPTIDE SUBSTRATES (OATP)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, turmeric might increase blood levels of OATP4C1 substrates.\nIn vitro research shows that the turmeric constituent curcumin competitively inhibits OATP4C1 transport. This transporter is expressed in the kidney and facilitates the renal excretion of certain drugs (113337). Theoretically, taking turmeric might decrease renal excretion of OATP substrates.\nless\nP-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, turmeric might increase the absorption of P-glycoprotein substrates.\nIn vitro and animal research shows that curcuminoids and other constituents found in turmeric can inhibit P-glycoprotein expression and activity (21472, 21473, 21474, 21475, 21476, 21477, 21478, 21479, 21480)(21482, 21484, 111644).\nless\nPACLITAXEL (Abraxane, Onxol)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, turmeric might alter blood levels of paclitaxel, although any effect may not be clinically relevant.\nClinical research in adults with breast cancer receiving intravenous paclitaxel suggests that taking turmeric may modestly alter paclitaxel pharmacokinetics. Patients received paclitaxel on day 1, followed by either no treatment or turmeric 2 grams daily from days 2-22. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that turmeric reduces the maximum concentration and area under the curve of paclitaxel by 12.1% and 7.7%, respectively. However, these changes are not likely to be considered clinically relevant (108876). Conversely, animal research suggests that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, enhances the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel (22005). However, the significance of this interaction is unclear, as this drug is typically administered intravenously in clinical settings.\nless\nSULFASALAZINE (Azulfidine)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTurmeric might increase the effects and adverse effects of sulfasalazine.\nClinical research shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, can increase blood levels of sulfasalazine by 3.2-fold (81131).\nless\nTACROLIMUS (Prograf)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTurmeric might increase the effects and adverse effects of tacrolimus.\nIn one case report, a transplant patient presented with acute nephrotoxicity and elevated tacrolimus levels of 29 ng/mL. The patient previously had tacrolimus levels within the therapeutic range at 9.7 ng/mL. Ten days prior to presenting at the emergency room the patient started consumption of turmeric powder at a dose of 15 or more spoonfuls daily. It was thought that turmeric increased levels of tacrolimus due to cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibition (93544). In vitro and animal research show that turmeric and its constituent curcumin inhibit CYP3A4 (21497, 21498, 21499).\nless\nTALINOLOL\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTurmeric may reduce the absorption of talinolol in some situations.\nClinical research shows that taking curcumin for 6 days decreases the bioavailability of talinolol when taken together on the seventh day (80079).

However, in the absence of piperine, the area under the curve for endoxifen and the maximum concentration of tamoxifen were not significantly reduced. Effects were most pronounced in patients who were extensive cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 metabolizers (107123).\nless\nTOPOISOMERASE I INHIBITORS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTurmeric has antioxidant effects.

However, research is conflicting.\nIn vitro research shows that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, inhibits camptothecin-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells by up to 71% (96126). However, other in vitro research shows that curcumin augments the cytotoxic effects of camptothecin. Reasons for the discrepancies may relate to the dose of curcumin and the chemotherapeutic agents. Lower doses of curcumin might have antioxidant effects while higher doses might have pro-oxidant effects (96125). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, turmeric might have.\nless\nTRAMADOL (Ultram)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, turmeric might increase or decrease levels of tramadol.\nAnimal research suggests that a single dose of curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may increase tramadol's maximum concentration (Cmax) by inhibiting metabolism, while continued daily use for 7 days may reduce the area under the curve (AUC) due to the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (116945). However, this interaction has not been reported in humans.\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTurmeric might increase the risk of bleeding with warfarin.\nOne case of increased international normalized ratio (INR) has been reported for a patient taking warfarin who began taking turmeric. Prior to taking turmeric, the patient had stable INR measurements. Within a few weeks of starting turmeric supplementation, the patient's INR increased to 10 (100906). Additionally, curcumin, the active constituent in turmeric, has demonstrated antiplatelet effects in vitro (11143, 81204, 81271), which may produce additive effects when taken with warfarin.\nless",

In vitro and animal research shows that turmeric might affect platelet aggregation. See other products with anticoagulant activity here.\nless\nHEPATOTOXIC HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS\nTheoretically, large doses of turmeric might increase the risk for hepatotoxicity.\nTaking turmeric with other products that might cause liver damage could potentially increase the risk for liver damage, especially when highly bioavailable formulations are used in high doses (103633, 107122, 109288, 110221, 111644). See other products with hepatotoxic potential here.\nless\nHERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS WITH HYPOGLYCEMIC POTENTIAL\nTheoretically, turmeric might have hypoglycemic effects.\nTaking turmeric with other products with hypoglycemic potential might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. The turmeric constituent, curcumin, might reduce blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes (79692, 79984, 80313, 80315, 80476, 80553, 81219, 80155, 81048, 96133, 104149, 114898, 114900). See other products with hypoglycemic potential here.\nless\nIRON\nThere is some concern that turmeric or curcumin supplements may decrease the absorption of iron; however, this interaction may not be clinically relevant.\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that turmeric and its constituent, curcumin, may bind with iron and prevent its absorption (21467, 21468, 21469, 21470). However, this does not appear to occur in humans when turmeric is used at levels commonly found in the diet (21471). This effect also has not been observed in a clinical trial in healthy patients receiving supplementation with both curcumin and ferrous sulfate (106798).\nless",

Theoretically, taking turmeric might increase the risk of bleeding and bruising in individuals with bleeding disorders.\nless\nHORMONE SENSITIVE CANCERS/CONDITIONS\nTurmeric might have mild estrogenic effects, which could theoretically exacerbate hormone-sensitive conditions. However, research is conflicting. Some in vitro evidence suggests that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, competitively inhibits the binding of 3H-estradiol or beta-galactosidase with the estrogen receptor (21486, 26203, 26204). Other in vitro research suggests that curcumin might have beneficial anticancer effects against hormone-sensitive cancers (26205, 26206).\nless\nINFERTILITY\nTheoretically, turmeric might have antifertility effects; until more is known, use with caution in patients trying to conceive. In vitro and animal research suggests that oral curcumin can reduce fertility, decrease sperm motility and density, cause degenerative changes in the seminiferous tubules, and reduce production of testosterone in adult Leydig cells (79404, 80650, 80944, 81069).\nless\nLIVER DISEASE\nTheoretically, turmeric might have hepatotoxic effects; especially when highly bioavailable formulations are used in high doses. Until more is known, avoid use in patients with cholestasis or hepatitis (103633). There have been at least 70 reports of liver damage associated with the use of turmeric supplements (99304, 102346, 103094, 103631, 103633, 103634, 107122, 109288, 110221, 111644).\nless\nPERIOPERATIVE\nTurmeric has antiplatelet and hypoglycemic effects, which might cause excessive bleeding or interfere with blood glucose control if used perioperatively (11143, 81204, 81217, 81271, 106793). Tell patients to discontinue turmeric at least 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with turmeric.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans, the oral bioavailability of curcumin is very low (10453, 18204, 79562, 80364). The average peak serum concentrations after taking curcumin 4 grams, 6 grams, and 8 grams were 0.51 mcM, 0.63 mcM, and 1.77 mcM, respectively (79085).\n\nCurcumin absorption appears to increase when taken with food (17096) or piperine (the active ingredient in black or white pepper) (81400, 104965), or when taken in a capsule (81136), in a liposomal formulation (80922, 102345, 104965), in a nanoparticle powder (102345, 102349, 113345), in a phospholipid complex (102345), as part of a novel turmeric matrix system (96129), or as a water-dispersible turmeric extract (106064). Despite suggestions that bromelain may enhance turmeric absorption, there is no supportive evidence.\n\nSpecific oral formulations of turmeric have demonstrated increased absorption. Absorption of curcumin from BCM-95 (Biocurcumax) is 5- to 7-fold higher than plain curcumin; elevated levels last over 8 hours with BCM-95, compared to 4-5 hours with plain curcumin (81460). Theracurmin, a nanoparticle water-dispersible formulation, produces a 27-fold higher area under the curve than plain curcumin powder, with a half-life of 13 hours (81092, 97424). When taken daily for 18 months, random blood levels of curcumin ranged between 3-67.3 ng/mL (96161). TurmXtra 60N, a water-dispersible turmeric extract containing 60% curcuminoids, results in increased curcumin absorption when compared to a standard extract. Taking TurmXtra at a dose providing curcumin at 10% of the levels of a standard extract results in similar peak and mean plasma levels of total curcuminoids and approximately doubles peak levels of total curcumin (106064).\n\nTopically, curcumin is detected in the deeper layers of skin, as well as in hair follicles, after application of a water microemulsion of turmeric (80094).\nMetabolism\nCurcumin undergoes significant metabolism in the liver and intestines, contributing to low oral bioavailability (102349). In humans, curcumin is present in the plasma as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates (10453, 18204, 79522, 80364). The half-lives of these conjugates are 6-24 hours (18204).\nExcretion\nIn humans, curcumin is present in the feces following consumption of an extract (10453). In some studies, curcumin was undetectable in the urine following oral intake (79085); however, other studies detected curcumin and its conjugates in the urine (79522, 79598, 79630, 80506).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of turmeric is the rhizome or roots. Turmeric's major active constituents are the curcuminoids (80713, 80809), which include the polyphenol curcumin (diferuloylmethane) (80405, 80434, 80599, 80642, 80691, 102345), demethoxycurcumin (80405, 80434, 80599, 80642, 80691), bisdemethoxycurcumin (80405, 80434, 80599, 80642, 80691), calebin, and other diarylheptanoids (79809). Turmeric rhizomes or roots also contain tumerin, tumerones (78963, 79338, 79465, 79924, 80125, 102350) and turmeronols (102350), and sesquiterpenes (79124, 79924, 80095, 80125, 80454). Other constituents of turmeric include minerals such as iron and potassium (79427, 80521); fatty acids, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid (49742); and the polysaccharides ukonans A-D (79468, 79587, 81186).\nAnalgesic effects\nOrally, turmeric and its constituent curcumin have been shown to reduce pain, particularly the late phase of pain, in animal models (80451, 80511). Although the exact mechanism of action is not clear, some evidence from in vitro research suggests that curcumin can inhibit transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated pain hypersensitivity (80898).\nAnti-allergy effects\nHuman research suggests that treatment with curcumin decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins from monocytes and neutrophils (96138).\nAnti-Alzheimer effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that curcumin might have activity in Alzheimer disease. In middle-aged and elderly adults, taking curcumin prevents measures of amyloid and/or tau accumulation in the amygdala and hypothalamus (96161). In animal models, curcumin caused disaggregation of amyloid beta, and decreased brain amyloid, plaque, and oxidized protein levels (17096, 79074, 79941, 80080, 80534). In vitro evidence suggests that curcumin reduces beta-amyloid production by inhibiting the upregulation of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which is the rate-limiting enzyme for beta-amyloid production (80368, 80409). Other in vitro research suggests that curcuminoids increase the clearance of amyloid beta from mononuclear cells and enhance the uptake of amyloid beta by macrophages from patients with Alzheimer disease (79941, 80144, 80520). In addition to reducing the production and increasing the clearance of amyloid beta, in vitro and animal research also suggest that curcuminoids from turmeric protect against impairment by, or toxicity of, amyloid protein (79023, 79096, 79179, 80913, 81030).\n\nEvidence from animal research also suggests that curcuminoids have acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities (80469, 80971).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nIn human research, some research has found that curcumin inhibits levels of inflammatory markers associated with arthritis, including C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and/or the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (96129, 110222). It also has antioxidant effects (110222) and may inhibit interleukin 1-beta (IL-1-beta) stimulated inflammatory and catabolic mediators, including prostaglandin E2, IL-6, IL-8, and nitric oxide (102349, 110222). Animal models suggest that turmeric extract reduces arthritis-associated joint inflammation by inhibiting NF-kB activation (79961). Curcumin also seems to suppress the production of matrix metalloproteinases, which are involved in cartilage degradation (79010, 80787, 102349). It also has a protective effect against degradation and the catabolic function of IL-1-beta, lipopolysaccharides, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in chondrocytes and cartilage (102349). Curcumin also stimulates matrix regeneration by restoring synthesis of collagen type II and glycosaminoglycan (102349). In vitro evidence suggests that turmeric rhizome extract inhibits the growth and promotes apoptosis in synovial fibroblasts, which are generally characterized by hyperplasia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (80153). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that curcumin inhibits the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which is involved in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis (70963).\nAnti-gingivitis effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that turmeric-containing mouthwashes may help reduce gingivitis severity in patients with this condition (81127, 89723). Potential mechanisms of action may include a reduction of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and increased collagen content and fibroblastic cell numbers (81062), inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta gene expression induced by a specific periodontopathic bacterium (80466), and inhibition of nicotine-induced ERK expression, which is involved in periodontal disease (79576).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCurcumin seems to have anti-inflammatory activity, possibly by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other cytokines involved in pro-inflammatory signaling pathways (11138, 11139, 11140, 12482, 18205, 79251, 79661, 80480, 81203, 96139)(102347, 107116). Curcumin also seems to inhibit inflammatory enzymes such as collagenase, elastase, and hyaluronidase (79251). Additionally, clinical research in mixed populations, including healthy adults as well as patients with a variety of comorbidities or autoimmune disorders, shows that turmeric or curcumin reduces the inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity (hs)-CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, the effect of turmeric or curcumin on IL-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is inconsistent (100260, 106793, 106794, 106795, 106804, 107109, 107116, 107119, 108873, 108875)(110218, 110219, 111353, 114898, 114899, 114900, 114903). Other research in humans has found no effect of curcumin on these or other inflammatory mediators (105396, 107109, 107117, 107119).\nAnti-lithogenic effects\nIn humans, curcumin can induce gallbladder contractions (11145, 78882). Theoretically, this may prevent gallstone production, as shown in animal models (79339, 81094).\nAnticancer effects\nTurmeric exhibits chemopreventive and growth inhibitory activity against several tumor cell lines (79042, 79580, 79689, 81110, 81209, 81273, 81331, 81349, 81350, 81440). It seems to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, possibly by upregulating p53 expression, and may inhibit angiogenesis (11141, 11142, 12482, 81065). Curcumin might reduce activity of procarcinogenic eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin-E2 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), via inhibition of cyclooxygenases and 5-lipoxygenase (18204, 80504, 80834, 80917). Preliminary evidence suggests curcumin can also reduce precancerous rectal aberrant crypt foci (18204, 81294). Some laboratory evidence suggests that curcumin can inhibit the cellular pathways leading to tumor metastasis, invasion, and angiogenesis (96132).\n\nTurmeric may also reduce the carcinogenic effect of other drugs or chemicals. In animal models, benzo(a)pyrene-related CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 induction is normalized by a 1% turmeric diet, suggesting that turmeric might inhibit activation of carcinogens that are metabolized by CYP enzymes (15823, 15824). The turmeric diet also appears to increase glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in some tissues (15823).\nAntidepressant effects\nIn humans, the antidepressant effects of curcumin were related to decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and increased levels of serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Decreased cortisol levels also suggest the role of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis in the anti-depressant effects of curcumin (96139, 114898). Evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that the antidepressant effects of turmeric extract stem from its ability to inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and possibly MAO B, which leads to increased levels of serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline (79192, 79652, 79707, 80432). The turmeric constituent curcumin also appears to increase adenylyl cyclase activity and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration, which has been associated with antidepressant effects (80607).\nAntidiabetic effects\nEvidence from animal and clinical research suggests that turmeric and its constituents reduce levels of glucose and HbA1c (79114, 79591, 79692, 79970, 79984, 80785, 114898, 114900) and elevate plasma insulin levels (80785, 81048), which may improve blood glucose control in diabetics.\n\nEvidence from animal models suggests that turmeric may reduce diabetic neuropathic pain by inhibiting the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) (79842). In addition to reducing diabetic neuropathic pain, turmeric may also prevent the development of diabetes-associated neuronal damage. Animal models suggest that turmeric may reduce neuronal damage associated with diabetes by reducing the expression of cerebellar proteins associated with cholinergic and insulin receptor activity, as well as glucose transport (80810). Curcuminoids from turmeric also appear to reduce diabetes-associated neuronal injury via antioxidant effects (80493).\n\nAnimal models suggest that curcumin may protect against the development of diabetic nephropathy by decreasing dephosphorylation and increasing acetylation of histone H3 and attenuating the increased expression of HSP-27 and MAP kinase p38 in the diabetic kidney (80249). Curcumin may also prevent diabetes-associated kidney dysfunction by inhibiting the histone acetyltransferase p300 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) (80594, 80742).\n\nAnimal models suggest that curcumin may help prevent the development of diabetic retinopathy by inhibiting diabetes-induced increases in interleukin-1beta, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and NF-kB levels in the retina (80071, 80147).\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, migraine, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or kidney failure shows that nanocurcumin supplementation improves fasting blood glucose levels, but not glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), regardless of baseline fasting blood glucose levels, trial duration, or body weight. Fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance also are improved (106793).\nAntimicrobial effects\nTurmeric or its curcuminoid constituents seem to have activity against some bacteria, including Eschericia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (36131, 39892, 43458, 51912, 80183, 80481, 80569, 80798). Some in vitro evidence suggests that the antibacterial action of curcumin against E. coli results from curcumin's inhibition of enoyl-ACP reductase from E. coli (80871). Other in vitro evidence suggests that curcumin inhibits the bacterial cell proliferation of Bacillus subtilis by inhibiting the assembly of FtsZ (80192). Additional in vitro evidence shows that turmeric constituents inhibit sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus cells, which prevents these cells from adhering to fibronectin; this may reduce S. aureus invasion of endothelial cells (79742). Other in vitro research shows that curcumin inhibits Ikappa B kinase-alpha and -beta and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase in Neisseria gonorrhoeae cells, which prevents the bacteria from adhering to mucosal epithelial cells (79637).\n\nTurmeric also appears to have activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (11140, 79359), hepatitis C (80886), hepatitis B (79694, 80644), herpes simplex (78899, 80244), and Epstein-Barr (79116, 81376) viruses. Also, animal models show that curcumin may have activity against the protozoan Leishmania amazonensis (11140, 79309), Toxoplasma gondii (80570), Schistosomiasis mansoni (80586), Giardia lamblia (79865), and Plasmodium (79980, 80619, 81011). In vitro evidence suggests that curcumin has antiparasitic activity against Cryptosporidium parvum (80706).\nAntioxidant effects\nPreliminary research suggests that turmeric and its constituent curcumin might have antioxidant effects (11140, 11147). Both turmeric and its constituents have been found to scavenge free radicals and phenolic oxidants and decrease levels of reactive oxygen species (39885, 49430, 71907, 79090, 79204, 80370, 102347). Curcumin has been shown to increase levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and other antioxidant enzymes in vitro and in animal research (80306, 80370, 80891, 81055, 81070). However, results of research in humans is mixed regarding the effect of turmeric or curcumin on levels of SOD or total antioxidant capacity, and some research shows that it reduces levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidation (100260, 106804, 109286, 111353, 114898, 114899, 114903). In one study, plasma vitamin E increased after 6 months of treatment with 1-4 grams/day of curcumin, possibly indicating that antioxidant effects of curcumin were sparing vitamin E (17096).\nAntishiga toxin effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that curcumin can reduce cell death associated with shiga toxin (stx)1 by enhancing expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) (79028) or blocking the binding of stx to cells (79903). Theoretically, this may contribute to the antidiarrheal effects of curcumin.\nAntithrombotic effects\nCurcumin might have antithrombotic effects. Preliminary research suggests it might inhibit platelet-activating factor and arachidonic acid platelet aggregation, possibly by interfering with thromboxane synthesis (11143, 46897, 81217) or by blocking TNF-alpha-induced expression of thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor (79578).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn human research, curcuminoids decrease the risk of myocardial infarction following coronary artery bypass grafting (81143). Laboratory evidence suggests that turmeric may protect against myocardial infarction by reducing inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix proteases (79382, 79588, 79607, 80371, 80653, 80802). Other cardiovascular effects induced by turmeric in laboratory research include blood pressure reduction (79673, 107113), vasorelaxation (79544, 79645, 80075, 81078), antithrombosis (78888, 79701), lipid level lowering (80325, 80640), and endothelial function improvement (80371, 80662).. Meta-analyses show that curcumin increases flow-mediated dilation, but not other measures of endothelial function (102348, 114903). Clinical studies show that turmeric or curcumin reduce some measures of arterial stiffness, including pulse wave velocity (101340, 114900, 114903). In atherosclerotic animal models, curcumin reduced atherosclerotic lesions (79150, 80325), improved left ventricular function (79382, 80802, 80924), and reversed cardiac hypertrophy (80724). Inhibition of migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and promotion of cell differentiation, have also been reported in animal and in vitro research (79073, 79325, 79426, 79729, 81419).\n\nThere is also interest in using turmeric to reduce cardiovascular risk. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, migraine, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or kidney failure shows that nanocurcumin supplementation improves levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol among those with elevated baseline levels and obesity. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is also improved, regardless of baseline levels or trial duration, particularly in those with metabolic syndrome or obesity and those who are overweight. Systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, is also improved, particularly in those with elevated baseline systolic blood pressure, with trial duration less than 12 weeks, and in those with metabolic syndrome (106793).\nFertility effects\nEvidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that curcumin can decrease sperm motility and density; cause degenerative changes in the seminiferous tubules; reduce luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated production of testosterone in adult Leydig cells; and reduce fertility when administered orally (79335, 79404, 80650, 80944, 81069). These effects are attributed to the inhibition of Leydig cell function or the hypothalamus-pituitary axis (79404). However, some evidence suggests that curcumin has positive effects on fertility. Laboratory research suggests that curcumin protects against the death of follicular cells and improves oocyte maturation in immune ovarian failure (81031). It also protects against ischemia-reperfusion induced injury of the testicles (80259).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn both human and animal research, turmeric or its constituents increased bowel motility (80494, 81075). In animal research, curcumin improved activity of digestive enzymes (49538). In animal research, turmeric and its constituent curcumin reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal ulcers and increased intestinal wall mucus and nonprotein sulfhydryl content (80042, 80560, 81187). Evidence from animal models also suggests that turmeric and its constituent curcumin reduce injury related to inflammatory colitis (79199, 79247, 79267, 79891).\nHematologic effects\nClinical research in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis shows that administering a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 10 days decreases white blood cell, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts, all of which were elevated at baseline, when compared with placebo. Curcumin also reduced platelet counts when compared with placebo, although these levels remained in the normal range throughout the study (108873).\nHepatoprotective effects\nTurmeric is traditionally used for liver health and for the treatment of jaundice and hepatitis. In animal models, turmeric constituents have been shown to attenuate induced liver damage and fibrosis (78957, 79322, 79439, 80416, 80699, 80705, 80831, 80846, 80857, 80923). Potential mechanisms of action include beneficial effects on levels and activity of inflammatory cytokines or matrix metalloproteases (79551, 79915, 80055, 80216, 80416, 80699, 80831, 80846, 80942). While most animal research shows that turmeric is hepatoprotective, some toxicity studies in animals suggests that turmeric extracts can increase liver enzymes and liver weight, especially when given in high doses for longer durations. Rarely, turmeric has been linked to cases of acute non-infectious cholestatic hepatitis, and most often these cases are related to the use of highly bioavailable formulations at high doses (103633). There is also evidence that the risk for hepatotoxicity with turmeric may be increased in individuals with the HLAB*35:01 allele (109288). However, the mechanism of turmeric-induced hepatotoxicity is unclear.\nHypolipidemic effects\nClinical research suggests turmeric reduces levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (78995, 89725, 114900). Curcumin and other constituents of turmeric also decrease levels of oxidized LDL (81268, 81306). Animal research suggests that turmeric may lower cholesterol by stimulating the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids by increasing the activity of hepatic cholesterol-7 alpha hydroxylase (80225, 81086, 81338, 81445). Other animal research suggests that turmeric decreases levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), which limits the formation of cholesterol in the body (81086). In vitro evidence suggests that the turmeric constituent curcumin upregulates the expression of LDL receptors on the surface of mouse macrophage and human hepatoma cells, which increases cholesterol uptake by these cells (79782, 79873, 80415).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nPreliminary research suggests that turmeric and curcumin might have immunostimulatory effects (11140, 11147).\nIron chelating effects\nHuman research in adults with beta-thalassemia intermedia shows that taking curcumin 500 mg three times daily for 3 months in addition to the iron chelator deferasirox and standard treatment downregulates mRNA expression of growth differentiating factor 15 (GDF-15), which may in turn reduce suppression of hepcidin levels. Elevated hepcidin promotes internalization and degradation of the transmembrane iron exporter ferroportin, thereby inhibiting the release of iron from enterocytes, hepatocytes, and macrophages into the plasma, resulting in iron-chelating effects (113606).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nA small clinical study in healthy young adult females with moderate physical activity levels shows that taking curcumin 500 mg daily for 8 weeks decreases muscle damage, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase, and improves maximum oxygen update (VO2 max) when compared with placebo (106804).\nRadioprotective effects\nPreliminary clinical and animal research suggests that turmeric or its constituent curcumin can decrease radiation-induced mucositis (79436, 89726). Potential mechanisms of action may involve a reduction in chromosomal aberrations, chromosomal fragments, and DNA strand breaks (78880, 79140, 79435, 80376, 81265, 81435). The protective effects may also be related to the antioxidant effects of turmeric (78877, 80955).\nRenal protective effects\nIn animal models, turmeric or curcumin prevented renal injury and reduced inflammation induced by ischemia/reperfusion or by agents such acetaminophen or cyclosporine (79663, 79725, 79798, 80579, 80622, 80624, 80857, 80948, 81413). Also, curcumin has been shown to inhibit the accumulation of collagen IV and fibronectin in the glomeruli of animals with nephritis (79488).\nRespiratory effects\nTurmeric is commonly used for bronchitis and respiratory infections. Although there is inadequate human research investigating curcumin for this purpose, laboratory research has been conducted in both animals and in vitro models. Curcumin has been found to prevent fibrosis following induced lung injury (78982, 79295, 79889, 80118, 80912). Curcumin also appears to inhibit lung inflammation (80806, 80909), airway hyperreactivity (79284, 80956), and pulmonary emphysema (80548). Potential mechanisms of action included the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines (78982, 79133, 79295, 79555, 80045, 80212), reduced neutrophil levels (80548), antioxidant effects (78982, 79295, 79539, 79552, 79555, 80203, 80909, 80956), effects on NF-kappa B cell signaling (79555), protection of the anti-inflammatory protein histone deacetylase-2 (80322), and decreased nitric oxide synthase activity (78982, 80417, 80956).\nSkin effects\nIn human research, taking curcumin was found to reduce pruritus severity (81120, 81176, 89724). Also, topical curcumin was of benefit in patients with skin lesions due to cancer (11148). Topical curcumin is commonly used for various skin conditions. Potential benefits of turmeric have been shown in animal models of skin damage, such as chronic ultraviolet B (UVB)-irradiated skin damage (80716). Benefits have included prevention of skin thickness increase and prevention of reduction in skin elasticity and the formation of wrinkles (80716). The inhibition of NF-kappaB may play a role in curcumin-induced beneficial effects in keratinocytes (79154). Would healing may also be improved. In animal research, topical curcumin increased cellular proliferation and collagen synthesis and crosslinking at the wound site, resulting in faster healing and increased tensile strength (79884). In the wound bed, curcumin resulted in alterations of TGF-beta and increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (79213).\nWeight loss effects\nCurcumin may have a beneficial effect in obesity through downregulation of Janus kinase, which is thought to have a role in the pathogenesis of obesity, and inhibition of an enzyme that activates cortisol in adipocytes, playing a role in central obesity. Curcumin may also inhibit adipocyte differentiation through suppression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), and enhance monophosphate activated protein kinase and lipolysis (102345)."

Approximately 22% of the turpentine oil in the body is excreted renally, with renal elimination of metabolites peaking at about 1.6 hours after administration (98852).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTurpentine oil is obtained by distillation of the oleoresin of longleaf pine or other pine species (6). It is composed of a mixture of terpenes and terpenoids, with an approximate composition of 59% to 85% alpha-pinene, 3% to 24% beta-pinene, 4% to 15% camphene, 5% to 15% limonene, and small amounts of delta-3-carene and terpinolenes. The exact composition is dependent upon the species of pine, the geographic location, and the time of harvest. R-alpha-pinene, which is found in higher concentrations in American pine than in European pine, has a stronger irritant effect than S-alpha-pinene (98855).\nCNS effects\nTurpentine oil is a central nervous system depressant and therefore, a pulmonary aspiration hazard.\nDermatologic effects\nWhen applied topically, turpentine oil is irritating and exhibits rubefacient and counterirritant effects (6, 11). R-alpha-pinene exhibits a stronger irritant effect than S-alpha-pinene. Turpentine oil derived from American pine contains higher quantities of R-alpha-pinene when compared with European pine (98855).\nRespiratory effects\nWhen inhaled, turpentine oil can have a decongestant effect, possibly by stimulating the cold receptors, which results in reflex vasoconstriction (7)."

At the end of the first week, up to 57% of patients in the Tylophora groups were improved compared with 23.5% to 31.6% of patients in the placebo groups. This improvement in the Tylophora group continued to last until at least the end of an 8-week follow-up period.

Major constituents of Tylophora include tylophorine, tylophorininine, desmethyltylophorine, desmethyltylophorinine, and kaempferol. Constituents in the roots include tylophorinidine and gamma fararine. Leaves contain D-septicine, D-iso-tylocrebrine, alpha- and beta-amyrine, beta-sitosterols, stigmasterol, and campesterols. Aerial parts contain skimmianine, ceryl alcohol, wax, resin, caoutchouc, tannin, glucose, calcium salts, and potassium salts (29116, 29126).\nAnti-cancer effects\nThere is interest in Tylophora for its antitumor effects. Preliminary research in animal models suggests that the stem and leaf extracts of Tylophora have anti-cancer effects against lymphoid leukemia and lymphocytic leukemia (29132). Other preliminary research shows that the Tylophora constituent tylophorine inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) angiogenesis processes of umbilical cells in vitro, which suggests that it might also inhibit angiogenesis and growth of tumor cells. Furthermore, tylophorine was shown to reduce tumor growth in mice models (98735).\nAnti-histamine effects\nIn animal research, intraperitoneally administered Tylophora extract was found to have direct bronchodilator and membrane stabilizing properties, as well as immunosuppressive effects (29131). In animal research, tylophorine, a constituent of Tylophora, inhibited systemic anaphylaxis, Schultz-Dale's reaction, and immunocytoadherence (29124). Tylophorine also inhibited mast cell degranulation and the associated release of histamine when induced by diazoxide. Proposed mechanisms of action include inhibition of mast cell degranulation due to an elevation in intracellular cAMP.\nEndocrine activity\nIn humans with asthma, Tylophora increased urinary 17-ketosteroids and decreased absolute eosinophil count (29130). Theoretically, this may be due to an indirect effect of Tylophora on the adrenal gland, causing release of adreno-corticoid hormones. In animal research, Tylophora antagonized the dexamethasone/hypophysectomy-induced suppression of the pituitary, suggesting a direct stimulation of the adrenal cortex (29125).\nImmune system effects\nIn animal research, Tylophora was found to depress cell-mediated immunity (29129). In humans, Tylophora may stimulate phagocytosis and concurrently inhibit humoral immunity (29119, 29122)."

However, the overall bioavailability of oral tyramine is low (105519). The absorption of tyramine is greatest under fasting conditions. Food reduces its absorption and bioavailability, and increases the time to peak levels by a median of 0.5 hours (100189).\nMetabolism\nTyramine is metabolized in various ways. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) metabolizes tyramine to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, which is further metabolized to 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPPA) (105519). Metabolism of tyramine by MAO takes place in the intestines and the liver, before reaching the general circulation, as well as in platelets (100189, 101010, 101018, 105519). Tyramine is also metabolized to dopamine by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzymes (105519) and to octopamine by dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (101015). Tyramine can also be sulfo-conjugated to tyramine-o-sulfate (101012). Tyramine is a substrate of organic cation transporter 1 (OTC1), which is believed to facilitate the metabolism and elimination of tyramine (105519).\n\nIn theory, individuals with genetic polymorphisms for enzymes that metabolize tyramine may have altered exposure to tyramine. However, clinical research in healthy adults with CYP2D6, MAO, and OTC1 polymorphisms has not demonstrated a difference in the pharmacokinetics or relevant clinical effects of tyramine, such as heart rate or blood pressure, after a single oral dose of 400 mg (105519).\nExcretion\nTyramine and its metabolites, including tyramine-o-sulfate and 4-HPPA, are excreted in urine (100194, 101012, 105519). In fasted conditions, the elimination half-life of tyramine was 0.5 hours. The elimination half-life increased to as much as 3 hours when taken with a meal (100189).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTyramine is a chemical derived from the amino acid tyrosine. It is considered a trace amine, a type of biogenic amine (100098, 100194). Although tyramine can be made naturally in the body from tyrosine, it is also produced in foods during the degradation of proteins by microbes, including during spoilage or during fermentation with tyramine-producing starter cultures (100191, 100195, 100196, 101010).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn clinical research, tyramine has been shown to increase systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure (100188, 100189, 100190, 101013, 101014, 105519). In healthy individuals, tyramine infusion has been shown to increase plasma noradrenaline, resulting in biochemical changes suggesting a more hypercoagulable state, as well as decreases in blood flow and vascular conductance (100193).\n\nTyramine is primarily metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO). If MAO is inhibited, typically by the use of an MAO inhibitor (MAOI), this can increase the absorption and circulating levels of tyramine, resulting in increased release of norepinephrine from peripheral adrenergic neurons (100189, 100192, 101010).\nNeurological effects\nTrace amine-specific receptors exist for tyramine and other trace amines. These receptors seem to signal intracellular functions and help tyramine play a role in the fine-tuning of neurotransmission (100098, 100194). After being actively transported across the sympathetic nerve membrane, tyramine indirectly stimulates the nerves by elevating synaptic levels of norepinephrine. However, it has only a small effect, if any, on plasma levels of norepinephrine. In this way, tyramine mimics the effects of sympathetic adrenergic nerve stimulation This mechanism of action is thought to at least partially explain the elevating effect of tyramine on blood pressure and cardiac output, as well as the inhibiting effects on insulin production by the pancreas (100188, 100189, 100190).\n\nTyramine causes migraines in some individuals. The mechanism of action is possibly related to the inhibition of tyramine breakdown, by inhibiting monoamine oxidase or other enzymes, an increase in the production of tyramine, and/or the metabolism of tyramine to octopamine. Both tyramine and octopamine can displace other monoamine neurotransmitters and trigger the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals (11996, 30868, 100098, 101010, 101012). In patients with migraine, especially those with migraine with aura, platelet levels of octopamine are elevated, while tyramine levels are not altered. However, normal tyramine levels are so low that any changes might be difficult to measure (100098). In patients with cluster headaches, elevated platelet levels of octopamine are accompanied by increased levels of platelet and plasma tyramine (11996).\nWeight loss effects\nTyramine is marketed in products as a stimulant and is included in some weight loss products (100198). However, in vitro, tyramine appears to be metabolized quickly in adipose cells and does not stimulate lipolysis. It might even have weak antilipolytic effects, although this is unlikely to be clinically relevant (100194)."

    "Tyrosine": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Tyrosine is a nonessential amino acid synthesized in the body from the essential amino acid, phenylalanine (7212). In the diet, it is found in beans, nuts, seeds, dairy, meats, fish, eggs, and some grains (7217). Since dietary needs of tyrosine are dependent on phenylalanine intake, tyrosine is an essential amino acid for individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU). These individuals are unable to consume phenylalanine in the diet (7212).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Tyrosine has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, short-term. Tyrosine has been used safely in doses up to 150 mg/kg daily for up to 3 months (7210, 7211, 7215). ...when used topically and appropriately (6155).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of tyrosine during pregnancy and lactation when used in medicinal amounts. Some pharmacokinetic research shows that taking a single dose of tyrosine 2-10 grams orally can modestly increase levels of free tyrosine in breast milk. However, total levels are not affected, and levels remain within the range found in infant formulas. Therefore, it is not clear if the increase in free tyrosine is a concern (91467).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, tyrosine seems to be well tolerated. No serious adverse effects have been documented; however, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Fatigue, headache, heartburn, and nausea.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, tyrosine can cause nausea and heartburn when taken at a dose of 150 mg/kg (7211). Taking tyrosine 4 grams daily in combination with 5-hydroxytryptophan 800 mg and carbidopa 100 mg can cause diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects can be mitigated by lowering the dosage (918).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, larger doses of tyrosine (150 mg/kg) can cause arthralgia, but this is uncommon (7211).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, larger doses of tyrosine (150 mg/kg) can cause headache and fatigue (7211). Taking a combination of tyrosine 4 grams, 5-hydroxytryptophan 800 mg, and carbidopa 100 mg can cause drowsiness and agitation. These effects can be mitigated by lowering the dosage (918).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nPhenylketonuria (PKU). Oral tyrosine as a component of medical foods is recommended in people with PKU, a disorder in which phenylalanine cannot be endogenously metabolized into tyrosine.\nTyrosine is used as a component of medical foods for people with phenylketonuria (PKU) (7212, 7213, 7232). Current guidelines recommend that people with PKU maintain a diet low in phenylalanine and incorporate tyrosine as a component of medical foods to maintain normal blood levels of tyrosine (95108). Supplementation with additional tyrosine is recommended only for patients with consistently low blood levels of tyrosine despite using tyrosine-containing medical foods (95108). Routine supplementation with free tyrosine is not recommended for most patients because it can produce wide variations in tyrosine plasma concentrations and side effects (7212, 95108). Tyrosine intake does not improve neuropsychological measures in patients with PKU (81503, 91471, 95108).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCognitive function. Oral tyrosine might improve cognitive function, particularly in patients exposed to stressors such as excessive cold, noise, or sleep deprivation.\nMost research suggests that taking tyrosine orally improves cognitive function, particularly under stressful conditions. Small clinical studies in healthy adults show that taking tyrosine 100-300 mg/kg in the setting of exposure to stressors such as excessive cold, noise, or sleep deprivation improves cognitive performance measures, such as executive function and short-term memory, when compared with placebo (7215, 81472, 81476, 81484, 81501). Other small clinical studies in healthy patients show that taking tyrosine 2 grams may improve response time without detracting from performance and could improve some measures of cognitive response to conflict when compared with placebo (101082, 111248). Some of these small studies may be inadequately powered to detect an effect on some cognitive function tests.\n\nTyrosine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for this purpose. A small clinical study in healthy adults with fatigue shows that taking tyrosine, serine, alanine, glutamate, and aspartate daily for 4 weeks improves measures of cognitive function including attention, spatial cognition, orientation, motivation, and time management when compared with placebo (111249). It is unclear if these effects are due to tyrosine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMemory. Taking tyrosine orally seems to improve memory in patients exposed to stressors such as cold or those having to complete multiple tasks at once.\nSmall clinical studies in healthy adults show that taking tyrosine 150-300 mg/kg prior to acute exposure to stress that is cold-induced, noise-induced, or induced by multi-tasking improves memory performance when compared with placebo (81469, 81477, 81499, 81501). However, tyrosine 150 mg/kg does not seem to improve memory in less stressful situations such as performing one simple task or testing when not exposed to cold (81469, 81499).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Oral tyrosine does not improve athletic performance when taken prior to exercise.\nClinical studies show that taking tyrosine orally prior to participating in treadmill or cycling exercises conducted at temperate temperatures or in the heat does not improve strength, endurance, or performance when compared with placebo (81471, 81474, 81504, 91470, 104403). Another very small clinical study in healthy males shows that taking a multi-ingredient pre-workout supplement containing L-tyrosine, beta-alanine, L-citrulline maleate, arginine alpha-ketoglutarate, L-taurine, and caffeine does not increase bench press strength endurance when compared with equivalent amounts of anhydrous caffeine (111250).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlcohol use disorder. Oral tyrosine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with alcohol use disorder shows that taking a combination of tyrosine 900 mg, D,L-phenylalanine 1.5 grams, L-glutamine 300 mg, and L-tryptophan 400 mg daily along with a multivitamin supplement reduces withdrawal symptoms and decreases stress when compared with placebo (81552). It is unclear if these effects are due to tyrosine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral tyrosine is beneficial for improving ADHD symptoms.\nA very small clinical study shows that taking tyrosine does not improve symptoms of ADHD in children when compared with baseline (7209). Furthermore, another very small clinical trial in adults with ADHD shows that taking tyrosine daily for 8 weeks does not improve inattention when compared with baseline. Some patients might have transient symptom improvement after 2 weeks, but seem to acquire tolerance by 6 weeks (7210). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and lack of control groups.\nless\nCocaine dependence. Oral tyrosine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with cocaine dependence shows that taking L-tyrosine 1 gram in the morning and L-tryptophan 1 gram in the evening for 14 days does not reduce drug cravings or withdrawal symptoms when compared with placebo (81480).\nless\nDementia. Oral tyrosine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in patients with severe Alzheimer disease or multi-infarct dementia shows that taking a combination of tyrosine 4 grams, 5-HTP 800 mg, and carbidopa 100 mg orally daily does not improve clinical or psychological parameters in most patients when compared with baseline (918). The validity of this finding is limited by the small study size and a lack of control group.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral tyrosine is beneficial for improving major depressive disorder.\nA small clinical study in patients with major depression shows that taking L-tyrosine 100 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks does not improve depressive symptoms when compared with placebo (7208).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Although there is interest in using oral tyrosine for ED, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tyrosine for this condition.\nFatigue. Oral tyrosine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy adults with fatigue shows that taking tyrosine, serine, alanine, glutamate, and aspartate daily for 4 weeks does not improve subjective or objective measures of fatigue when compared with placebo (111249).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral tyrosine is beneficial for reducing hypertension of mild severity.\nA very small clinical study in patients with mild essential hypertension shows that taking oral tyrosine 2.5 grams three times daily with meals for 2 weeks does not affect systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with control (81487).\nless\nMitochondrial myopathies. Although there is interest in using oral tyrosine for nemaline myopathy, a type of mitochondrial myopathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tyrosine for this condition.\nNarcolepsy. It is unclear if oral tyrosine is beneficial for improving narcolepsy symptoms.\nA small clinical study in patients with narcolepsy shows that taking capsules containing tyrosine 3 grams orally three times daily for 4 weeks might reduce feelings of tiredness or drowsiness when compared with placebo, but the overall effect is not clinically significant. Tyrosine also does not seem to improve sudden muscle weakness, sleep paralysis, night-time sleep, sleep latency, or speed and attention after waking when compared with placebo (81482).\nless\nObesity. Oral tyrosine has only been evaluated for in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in overweight or obese patients shows that taking a supplement containing tyrosine 1.2 grams, cayenne 450 mg, green tea 1.5 grams, caffeine 150 mg, and calcium carbonate 3.89 grams daily for 8 weeks slightly reduces body fat mass by 0.9 kg when compared with placebo (81475). It is not clear if any potential benefit is due to tyrosine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOpioid withdrawal. Oral tyrosine has only been evaluated for heroin withdrawal in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in Chinese males undergoing detoxification for heroin addiction shows that taking a combination of tyrosine 50 mg/kg, 5-HTP 200 mg, phosphatidylcholine 1200 mg, and L-glutamine 50 mg/kg daily for 6 days can reduce insomnia and withdrawal symptoms and improve mood when compared with placebo (88178). It is not clear if this effect is due to tyrosine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nParkinson disease. Although there is interest in using oral tyrosine for Parkinson disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tyrosine for this condition.\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Although there is interest in using oral tyrosine for PMS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tyrosine for this condition.\nSchizophrenia. It is unclear if oral tyrosine is beneficial for improving schizophrenia symptoms.\nA very small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking L-tyrosine 10 grams daily in four divided doses along with molindone 150 mg daily for 3 weeks does not improve symptoms of schizophrenia when compared with taking molindone alone (81554).\nless\nSleep deprivation. It is unclear if oral tyrosine is beneficial for improving alertness in sleep deprived adults.\nA small clinical study shows that taking tyrosine 150 mg/kg after the loss of a night's sleep seems to delay performance decline in psychomotor tests by about 3 hours when compared with placebo (7215). Another small clinical study in sleep-deprived patients shows that taking tyrosine 150 mg/kg improves memory, reasoning, and vigilance when compared with placebo at 5.5 hours after ingestion, but not at 1.5 hours. Tyrosine was less effective than taking amphetamine, phentermine, or caffeine (81472).\nless\nStress. Although there is interest in using oral tyrosine for stress, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of tyrosine for this condition.\nWrinkled skin. Topical tyrosine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small study in patients with photodamaged skin shows that applying a topical preparation containing 10% vitamin C, acetyl tyrosine, zinc sulfate, sodium hyaluronate, and bioflavonoids (High Potency Serum, Cellex-C International Inc.) for 3 months to the face seems to improve fine and coarse wrinkling, yellowing and sallowness, roughness, and skin tone when compared with placebo (6155). It is unclear if the benefits are due to tyrosine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of tyrosine for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nTyrosine levels are increased in the blood in a dose-dependent manner following oral use (81502, 91467, 91470, 98221). For a given dose, plasma levels appear to be higher in adults over 60 years of age than in younger adults, possibly due to lower first-pass metabolism in the liver (98221). Peak plasma levels of tyrosine generally occur within 1.5-3 hours after oral intake, although the time to maximum plasma concentration may be as long as 6 hours in some patients (91467).\nDistribution\nTyrosine is classified as a large neutral amino acid (LNAA) and is transported across the blood brain barrier by the LNAA transporter. Tyrosine competes with other LNAAs, such as tryptophan, to get into the brain (7217).\nMetabolism\nIn the brain, tyrosine is converted to L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa), dopamine, norepinephrine, and then epinephrine. The rate limiting enzyme is tyrosine hydroxylase (81470). In healthy humans, an acute intake of tyrosine increases plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine (81495). Adults over 60 years of age have higher plasma levels of tyrosine than younger individuals taking the same dose. This may cause negative feedback inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, blunting the dopamine response compared with younger adults (98221).\nExcretion\nIntake of tyrosine increases urinary levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, vanillylmandelic acid, and homovanillic acid in men (81523).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nTyrosine is a nonessential amino acid that the body synthesizes from phenylalanine. For people with phenylketonuria (PKU) who cannot synthesize tyrosine from phenylalanine, tyrosine is an essential amino acid (7212). Tyrosine can also be obtained from dietary proteins in dairy products, meats, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, oats, and wheat. When dietary intake of tyrosine is inadequate, phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine (7217). Dietary needs of tyrosine are dependent on phenylalanine intake. When phenylalanine intake is adequate (about 9 mg/kg daily), dietary tyrosine intake should be about 7 mg/kg daily (7214). Inadequate tyrosine intake is rare in developed nations. Tyrosine is incorporated into all proteins.\nAnti-stress effects\nTyrosine is a precursor of thyroxine and melanin (7212); it is also a precursor for the synthesis of catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine (7215, 7217). There is interest in tyrosine for preventing the negative effects related to stress. Some scientists think that the brain may not be able to synthesize enough tyrosine from phenylalanine under stressful conditions (7217). Catecholamines like epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine that are synthesized from tyrosine can become depleted during stress (81488). There is speculation that increasing the availability of tyrosine to the brain allows increased catecholamine synthesis, and avoidance of the negative effects of stress, such as the physical expression of fear (91466, 91468, 104402). There is some evidence in animals and humans that supplemental tyrosine might improve performance, memory, and learning, under extreme environmental conditions, intense exercise, psychological stress (7215, 7217, 81476, 81484, 81501, 91470).\nAntidepressant effects\nTyrosine may play a role in depression. Tyrosine is a precursor for the synthesis of catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine (7215, 7217). Low levels of norepinephrine may play a role in depression and dopamine may play a role in the function of antidepressant agents (81470). In healthy humans, an acute intake of tyrosine increases plasma levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine (81495). In human research, drinking an amino acid beverage lacking in the catecholamine precursors tyrosine and phenylalanine resulted in reduced the response of the brain to incentives; however, there were no functional changes in behavior (91465).\nCognitive effects\nThere is interest in using tyrosine for enhancing cognitive function. It is theorized that tyrosine enhances cognitive function by acting as a precursor for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine (111249)."
