        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are short molecular chains primarily made up of the sugar galactose, as well as lesser amounts of the sugars glucose and lactose. GOS are found in foods such as dairy products, legumes, and certain root vegetables. They are not digested in the intestines, but rather are fermented by bacteria in the colon (26702, 26732). GOS are sometimes used as prebiotics to increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the intestine.",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods. GOS are found in various foods, including dairy products, legumes, and some root vegetables (26702, 26732).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term. GOS or foods fortified with GOS up to 20 grams daily have been safely used in clinical research for up to 30 days (21191, 26706, 26712, 26727, 99224, 106526, 106529, 107715, 107729). The European Food Safety Authority has concluded that consuming food products providing GOS up to 16.2 grams daily does not present safety concerns (106530). This agency has not evaluated the safety of higher doses in food products.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in breast milk or infant formulas containing up to 7.2 grams/L of GOS provided as the sole prebiotic or in combination with other prebiotics, including fructo-oligosaccharides or polydextrose, daily for 4-12 months (26708, 26709, 26710, 26720, 99211, 99212, 99215, 99218, 99222, 99223, 106527). ...when used in doses of up to 10 grams daily for 3 weeks in females 10-13 years of age (99210).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally. GOS have been safely used in clinical research in doses of about 4.5 grams daily from week 25 of pregnancy until delivery (26721).",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, GOS seem to be well tolerated in infants, children, and adults.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Bloating, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, and increased stool frequency.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals.\nDermatologic\nOrally, giving a formula supplemented with 4 grams/L of GOS and polydextrose (1:1 ratio) to infants has been associated with an increased incidence of atopic dermatitis in one clinical study (26709). However, most other clinical research in infants at risk of atopy shows that GOS-containing formula may actually reduce the risk of developing atopic dermatitis (26707, 26708, 99223).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, galacto-oligosaccharides may cause bloating, flatulence, and increased stool frequency (26706, 26709, 26724, 99217, 99222). Giving a formula supplemented with 4 grams/L of GOS and polydextrose (1:1 ratio) to infants has been associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects, primarily constipation and diarrhea, in one clinical study (106527). However, it is unclear if this was due to GOS, polydextrose, or the combination.\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, GOS have been rarely associated with allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Research in these patients shows that people who are previously sensitized to Blomia tropicalis, a common dust mite in Southeast Asia, may also experience allergic reactions after consumption of GOS. Blomia tropicalis contains glycosylated allergens that have IgE mediated cross-reactivity to GOS (102508).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, giving infants a formula supplemented with 8 grams/L of a 50:33:17 mixture of polydextrose, GOS, and lactulose has been associated with increased infant irritability when compared with control formula (26709). However, it is not known if this was related to the GOS, other ingredients, or the combination. An increase in irritability did not occur in infants given a formula supplemented with 4 grams/L of polydextrose and GOS (1:1 ratio) (26709, 106527).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). In infants at risk for atopy, providing syrup or formula containing GOS along with probiotics or fructo-oligosaccharides may reduce the risk of developing atopic dermatitis.\nOne large clinical trial in infants at high risk for allergies shows that feeding 20 drops of syrup containing GOS 0.8 grams, in combination with one opened capsule of probiotic bacteria, daily for 6 months reduces the incidence of dermatitis and atopic dermatitis by the age of 2 years when compared with placebo (26707). It is unclear if these findings are due to GOS, probiotics, or the combination, especially since mothers in the treatment group also took probiotics for 2-4 weeks before delivery. Also, a small clinical trial in newborns at risk for atopic disease shows that feeding a formula containing a combination of GOS and fructo-oligosaccharides 8 grams/L as often as necessary for 6 months reduces the risk, but not severity, of developing atopic dermatitis when compared with placebo formula (26708). At 2 years of age, the infants given this formula were half as likely to have developed atopic dermatitis (99223). However, in one study in healthy formula-fed infants, formula containing 4 grams/L of GOS and polydextrose (1:1 ratio) given as often as necessary for approximately 4 months increased the potential of developing atopic dermatitis as an adverse effect by up to 11% when compared with control formula (26709).\nless\nColic. Providing formula containing GOS and other ingredients may reduce the duration or frequency of crying episodes in infants with colic.\nOne clinical trial in infants with colic shows that feeding a formula containing 8 grams/L of a prebiotic mixture of GOS 90% and fructo-oligosaccharides 10% as often as necessary for 14 days reduces the number of colic episodes when compared with a control formula plus simethicone 6 mg/kg twice daily (26710). Another clinical trial in healthy infants 14-35 days of age shows that feeding a cow's milk-based formula containing 4 grams/L of a prebiotic blend of GOS and polydextrose (1:1 ratio) until around 4 months of age leads to faster normalization of daytime sleep patterns when compared with cow's milk-based formula alone. Episodes of crying were also shorter after 2 months, but not 4 months, of supplementation (106527). It is unclear if the findings from this study in healthy infants can be generalized to those with colic.\nless\nLactose intolerance. Oral GOS may improve some symptoms of lactose intolerance and allow for increased consumption of lactose-containing products, even after discontinuing GOS.\nAlthough a small clinical study found no effect with the use of GOS (99224), one large clinical study in patients with lactose intolerance shows that taking GOS titrated up to 7.5-10 grams twice daily for 30 days improves overall symptoms of lactose intolerance, and in particular cramping and bloating, when compared with placebo (106526). Patients in these studies were asked to avoid lactose-containing products during the treatment period, so the effect of GOS on symptoms in patients actively consuming lactose products is unclear. After the study period, patients were asked to reintroduce lactose products into their diets. Those that had been taking GOS in both studies reported increased milk intake and fewer symptoms when compared with those previously treated with placebo, suggesting that the effects of GOS continue after discontinuation (99224, 106526).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Supplementation with oral GOS during the first 6 months of life may not prevent the development of allergic rhinitis in infants at risk for allergies.\nOne large clinical trial in infants at risk for allergies shows that feeding 20 drops of syrup containing GOS 0.8 grams, in combination with one opened capsule of probiotic bacteria, daily for 6 months does not reduce the risk of developing allergic rhinitis by the age of 2 years when compared with placebo (26707).\nless\nFood allergies. Supplementation with oral GOS during the first 6-12 months of life may not prevent the development of food allergies at 1 or 2 years of age.\nOne large clinical trial in infants at risk for allergies shows that feeding 20 drops of syrup containing GOS 0.8 grams, in combination with one opened capsule of probiotic bacteria, daily for 6 months does not reduce the risk of developing food allergies by the age of 2 years when compared with placebo (26707). Another large clinical study in healthy, full-term infants shows that feeding a formula containing GOS 4.4-5 grams/L from 8 weeks of age until 12 months of age does not reduce the incidence of allergic sensitization to foods, based on skin prick testing, when compared with placebo (99218).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Large studies suggest that oral GOS do not prevent the development of URTIs in healthy infants or young adults. It is unclear if GOS are beneficial for the prevention of URTIs in premature infants.\nA large clinical study in healthy, term infants shows that feeding a formula containing GOS 4.4-5 grams/L from before 8 weeks of age until 12 months of age does not reduce the incidence of URTIs (99218). Also, a large clinical trial in healthy university students going through exam-related stress shows that taking GOS (Purimmune, GTC Nutrition) 2.5 or 5 grams daily for 8 weeks does not reduce the total number of cold or flu symptoms when compared with placebo (99221). GOS, in combination with polydextrose, has been evaluated in premature infants. A small clinical trial shows that feeding a 1:1 combination of these at a dose of 600-1200 mg daily during the first 60 days of life reduces the incidence of URTIs, including the common cold, when compared with placebo. However, this prebiotic combination does not seem to reduce the duration or severity of respiratory tract infections that do occur (99211). It is unclear if any effects are due to GOS, polydextrose, or the combination.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnxiety. It is unclear if oral GOS are beneficial in patients with anxiety.\nOne small clinical study in healthy females 18-25 years of age shows that taking GOS 5.5 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve anxiety scores overall or in subgroups of individuals reporting high or low baseline levels of anxiety when compared with placebo (106640).\nless\nAsthma. It is unclear if GOS, alone or in combination with fructo-oligosaccharides, are beneficial for preventing the development of asthma or recurrent wheeze in infants at risk for allergies.\nOne large clinical study in infants at risk for allergies shows that feeding 20 drops of syrup containing GOS 0.8 grams, in combination with one opened capsule of probiotic bacteria, daily for 6 months does not reduce the risk of developing atopic disease, including asthma, by the age of 2 years when compared with placebo (26707). However, another large clinical study in newborns at risk for atopic disease shows that feeding a formula containing a combination of GOS and fructo-oligosaccharides 8 grams/L as often as necessary for 6 months reduces the risk of developing recurrent wheezing, a risk factor for asthma, by 2 years of age when compared with placebo. Approximately 8% of infants given GOS formula developed recurrent wheeze, compared to about 21% of those given placebo formula (99223). These discrepant findings may be due to differences in measured outcomes, as well as the doses and products studied.\nless\nColorectal cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral GOS for the prevention of colorectal cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GOS for this purpose.\nConstipation. It is unclear if oral GOS, when taken with water or added to yogurt, are beneficial in patients with constipation.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with constipation shows that taking a specific GOS product (Biotis GOS, Friesland Campina) orally as 5.5-11 grams daily for three weeks does not increase stool frequency when compared with placebo (107730). Similarly, one very small clinical study in elderly females with constipation shows that consuming yogurt containing a specific syrup (Elix'or, Borculo Domo Ingredients) providing GOS 4.5 grams twice daily for 2 weeks does not improve defecation frequency, laxative use, or ease of defecation when compared with placebo (26706).\n\nAnother small clinical study in elderly patients with mild constipation shows that consuming yogurt containing GOS 12 grams, prunes 12 grams, and linseed 6 grams daily for 3 weeks increases the frequency and ease of defecation and improves relief when compared with a traditional yogurt in elderly patients with mild constipation (21191). However, it is unclear if these findings are due to GOS, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral GOS are beneficial in patients with depression.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with major depressive disorder shows that taking GOS 5 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve symptoms of depression when compared with placebo, and appears to be less effective when compared with a probiotic supplement containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum (102506).\nless\nDiarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral GOS for the prevention and treatment of diarrhea, including travelers' diarrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GOS for this purpose.\nInsomnia. Oral GOS have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; their effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small crossover trial in adults with sleep disturbances shows that taking a combination product containing GOS 5.2 grams, whey protein 9.5 grams, large neutral amino acids 3.4 grams, and other vitamins and minerals one hour before bed nightly for 3 weeks does not improve sleep quality when compared with a control product containing no GOS and smaller amounts of protein, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals (106528).\nless\nIron deficiency anemia. GOS increases the absorption and tolerability of iron supplements, and may therefore be beneficial in patients with iron deficiency anemia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking GOS with iron supplements increases the absorption and tolerability of iron (102509, 102510, 107729). One small clinical trial in adult females shows that taking GOS 15 grams orally as a single dose increases the fractional iron absorption from oral ferrous sulfate, containing 104 mg iron, by 45% when compared with control (107729). Other clinical research in young, iron-deficient females, shows that giving GOS 963 mg/kg in addition to ferrous sulfate 30 ppm, increases mean hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, serum iron, serum transferrin, and total iron binding capacity when compared with ferrous sulfate alone (110599).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral GOS are beneficial in patients with IBS.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with IBS shows that taking GOS 1.4 grams daily while following a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) for 4 weeks increases the odds of adequate IBS symptom relief by 4.6-fold when compared with placebo plus a sham diet. However, no difference in rate of adequate symptom relief was reported when GOS plus the low FODMAP diet were compared with placebo plus the low FODMAP diet, suggesting that any benefits may have been due to the diet (106525).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral GOS are beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA small clinical study in overweight patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking GOS 5.5 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve most measures of metabolic syndrome when compared with placebo. Although levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin were reduced by a small amount, these changes were not clinically meaningful (99219).\nless\nNeonatal jaundice. It is unclear if oral GOS are beneficial for the treatment of neonatal jaundice.\nA small clinical study in healthy infants with mild hyperbilirubinemia shows that providing a formula containing a combination of GOS and fructo-oligosaccharides 8 grams/L as often as necessary for 28 days reduces levels of bilirubin within 72 hours when compared with those given placebo formula. Whether GOS can reduce bilirubin levels in infants with very high levels of bilirubin is unknown, as these infants were excluded from this study (99222).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral GOS improves weight loss in overweight or obese adults.\nA small clinical study in overweight adults shows that taking GOS 6 grams, 12 grams, or 18 grams daily in oolong tea for 2 weeks has a small effect on appetite and weight loss when compared with oolong tea alone. Weight loss of 0.1-0.2 kg occurred over the study period, compared with no change in those taking oolong tea alone (99217).\nless\nOsteoporosis. Although there has been interest in using oral GOS for osteoporosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GOS for this purpose.\nPrematurity. It is unclear if oral GOS are beneficial for improving cognitive or motor development in premature infants.\nA small clinical study in premature infants shows that adding a combination of GOS, fructo-oligosaccharides, and pectin acidic oligosaccharides up to 1.5 grams/kg daily to breast milk or formula for 30 days after birth does not improve cognitive or motor development outcomes at the age of 2 years when compared with placebo (99216).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral GOS are beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with ulcerative colitis shows that taking a specific GOS product (Bimuno GOS, Clasado Biosciences) orally 2.8 grams daily for 6 weeks does not increase clinical remission or improve IBD severity scores when compared with baseline. However, subgroup analyses suggest that taking GOS may reduce the frequency and urgency of loose stools. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group (107728).\nless\nUrticaria. It is unclear if oral GOS are beneficial for the prevention of urticaria in infants.\nA small clinical study in newborns at risk for atopic disease shows that feeding a formula containing a combination of GOS and fructo-oligosaccharides 8 grams/L as often as necessary for 6 months reduces the risk of developing urticaria at 2 years of age when compared with placebo. Approximately 1.5% of infants in the GOS group developed urticaria, compared to 10.3% of those in the placebo group (99223).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate GOS for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGOS are most often used in doses of 5-20 grams daily for up to 30 days. Doses of 2.5-5.5 grams daily have been taken for up to 12 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nGOS are most often given to infants in formulas that also contain fructo-oligosaccharides or polydextrose. Formulas containing a mixture of GOS (90%) and fructo-oligosaccharides (10%) are most often formulated at a concentration of 8 grams/L and given as often as necessary for up to 6 months. Formulas containing a mixture of GOS (50%) and polydextrose (50%) are most often formulated at a concentration of 4 grams/L and given as often as necessary for up to 4 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nThere is insufficient reliable evidence available about the standardization of GOS.",

Until more is known, avoid or use with caution in patients with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Human and animal studies suggest that GOS might have immunostimulant effects (26711, 26723).\nless\nCROSS ALLERGENICITY\nGOS may cause an allergic reaction in individuals sensitive to the dust mite species Blomia tropicalis (102508). Avoid the use of GOS in these patients.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable evidence available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with GOS.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Metabolism\nBecause human digestive enzymes can only hydrolyze beta-glycosidic bonds in lactose, it is this bond that prevents GOS from being digested in the intestines (26703). Instead, they are fermented in the colon by anaerobic bacteria, which stimulates the growth of beneficial bacteria (26704).\nExcretion\nLike human milk oligosaccharides, GOS pass through the intestines undigested and are eliminated in the stool (26732).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGOS are short polymers of galactose and glucose (26703). They consist of beta-1,6-linked galactopyranosyl units and alpha-glycosidic bonding to a terminal glycopyranosyl residue (26731). GOS are found in foods such as dairy products, legumes, and certain root vegetables (26702, 26732). Over 150 GOS have been identified in human breast milk, of which the most common are 6-sialyllactose and lacto-N-hexaose (100409).\nAnti-allergy effects\nSome clinical evidence in infants shows that feeding formula containing GOS reduces the risk of developing atopic conditions such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) (26707, 26708, 99223). However, in infants with atopic dermatitis, feeding a formula containing the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve in addition to the prebiotics GOS and fructo-oligosaccharides does not improve levels of inflammatory or anti-inflammatory markers, or immunoglobulin markers (99220).\nAnticancer effects\nAnimal research suggests that GOS may have anticancer effects. In rats with chemically induced colorectal tumors, tumor size and burden were shown to increase with dietary fat; however, fermentable GOS exhibited protective effects that were greater than nonfermentable cellulose (26713). This protective effect may be due to the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) generated during colonic fermentation. Bile acids have been associated with colorectal carcinogenesis (26714, 26715); SCFAs have been shown to lower colonic pH and promote the precipitation of bile acids while inhibiting the secondary bile acid formation (26716). Possible anti-inflammatory properties of prebiotics, shown in human and laboratory research (26717, 99217, 99219), may also contribute to cancer-preventive effects.\nCalcium absorption effects\nClinical evidence suggests that consumption of a yogurt drink containing GOS modestly increases calcium absorption in postmenopausal patients from 20.6% to 23.9% when compared with a yogurt without GOS. Increased calcium excretion in the urine does not occur, suggesting that the change in calcium absorption may be associated with increased uptake by bone and/or the inhibition of bone resorption (27550). A smoothie drink containing GOS also increases calcium absorption of up to 13% in adolescent girls (99210).\nImmune-modulating effects\nSome clinical evidence suggests that GOS may stimulate the immune system; however, conflicting evidence exists. Supplementing infant formula with a combination of GOS and fructo-oligosaccharides seems to increase fecal secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels when compared with standard formula in infants (26711). However, in one clinical trial of healthy and older adults, GOS did not improve markers of immune function in either patient population (106529).\n\nAnimal research shows that a mixture of GOS and fructo-oligosaccharides (9:1 ratio) increases delayed-type hypersensitivity in a murine influenza vaccination model, suggesting that GOS/fructo-oligosaccharides stimulate adaptive immunity (26723). Other evidence from animal research suggests that GOS might have immunosuppressive effects. In ovalbumin-sensitized rats, GOS suppressed airway eosinophilia; this effect occurred even after neomycin administration, suggesting that this effect was not mediated by the intestinal microflora (26722).\nIron absorption effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking GOS with iron supplements increases the absorption and tolerability of iron (102509, 102510, 107729). One small clinical trial in adult females shows that taking GOS 15 grams orally once increases the fractional iron absorption from oral ferrous sulfate, containing 104 mg iron, by 45% when compared with control (107729). Other clinical research in young, iron-deficient females, shows that giving GOS 963 mg/kg in addition to ferrous sulfate 15 ppm, increases mean hemoglobin and hematocrit when compared with ferrous sulfate alone. Giving 30 ppm ferrous sulfate with GOS increases the mean values for red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, serum iron, serum transferrin, and total iron binding capacity in addition to hemoglobin and hematocrit (110599). These effects are thought to be due to the ability of GOS to increase gastric residence time, enhance production of iron absorption proteins, increase proliferation of enterocytes which transport minerals out of the gut lumen, and decrease luminal pH, increasing reduction of ferric to ferrous iron. The decrease in luminal pH is due to fermentation of GOS by the gut flora and enhanced production of short-chain fatty acids (102509, 110599).\nPrebiotic effects\nThe prebiotic effects of indigestible oligosaccharides are well established and have been shown in numerous in vitro, animal, and clinical studies to alter the host microbial balance (26718). GOS can increase the fecal content of beneficial bacteria in the gut, including bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and possibly others (99210, 99217, 99218, 99219, 99213, 99214, 106529, 107715, 107730). Preliminary clinical research suggests that taking GOS 11 grams daily increases the concentration of bacteria in the gut when compared with taking a lower dose of 5.5 grams daily (107730). Preliminary clinical research in adult females also shows that these GOS-induced bacterial changes are associated with changes in dietary habits, including reduced total carbohydrate consumption, when compared with control (107715).\n\nNumerous studies have also shown prebiotics (such as inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides, and GOS) to promote the establishment of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the infant gut, which mimics the flora of breastfed infants (26719, 26730, 99215). GOS have been shown to raise fecal acetate and beta-glucuronidase activity (26727). Preliminary in vitro evidence suggests that, among prebiotics, GOS generates some of the highest levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and largest decreases of pathogenic bacteria (26729). In a study which monitored the gut microbiota of infants aged one month, those fed exclusively with a GOS-containing formula had a lower abundance of Clostridium perfringens (110409). In gnotobiotic rats inoculated with human fecal flora, GOS increase hydrogen and methane excretion (26733).\nSkin pigmentation effects\nThere is interest in using GOS to promote healthy skin and moderate skin pigmentation. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking GOS 1 gram twice daily for 12 weeks decreases measures of melanin and erythema in the skin, suggesting that GOS might inhibit skin pigmentation and inflammation caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. In vitro research suggests this might be due to the inhibitory effect of GOS on the production of melanin and the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 and prostaglandin E2 (102507).\nWeight loss effects\nIn human research, addition of GOS to oolong tea decreased hunger and increased fullness and satiety when compared with oolong tea alone. Food intake at subsequent meals was reduced by a small amount (99217)."

            "Effectiveness": "POSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). Small clinical studies suggest that oral Galphimia glauca may be beneficial in adults with GAD.\nTwo clinical studies in adults with GAD show that taking Galphimia glauca extracts standardized to contain galphimine B 0.35-0.7 mg, twice daily for 4-15 weeks, reduces anxiety scores similarly to lorazepam 0.5-1 mg twice daily (26542, 99507). However, one of these studies had a high dropout rate, limiting the validity of these findings. Based on these studies, clinical practice guidelines from the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) weakly recommend galphimia glauca extract at doses of 350-700 mg, standardized to galphimine-B, twice daily as monotherapy in adults with GAD (110318).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of Galphimia glauca are the leaves (99507). Constituents isolated from Galphimia glauca include quercetin and its glucosides, isoquercitrin, gallic acid and derivatives such as methylgallate, ellagic acid, maslinic acid, glaucacetalin E, alpha and beta amyrin, lupeol catechin, terpenoid galphins A, B and C, galphimidin, galphimidin B, stigmasterol, sitosterol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside, and flavonoid acylglycosides (27803, 27804, 27808, 50766, 66969, 108505). It also contains quinic acid and its derivatives, digalloylquinic acid, trigalloylquinic acid, and tetragalloylquinic acid (27804, 27812). Norsecotriterpenes isolated from Galphimia glauca include galphimines A, B, E, and J (26542, 26544, 26550, 27801, 27808, 27809, 27810, 27811, 108504).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAn animal model of arthritis and plantar edema suggests that galphimia glauca extract and its constituents galphimine A and galphimine B may reduce inflammation through the modulation of some anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory markers (116212).\nAntiallergy effects\nIn isolated guinea pig trachea, Galphimia glauca extract inhibits leukotriene D4-induced bronchoconstriction (26549). In animal studies, a Galphimia glauca extract and its constituent tetragalloylquinic acid inhibit bronchial reactions to allergens and platelet activating factor, but not to histamine and acetylcholine (27804, 50766, 66969).\nAntiproliferative effects\nIn vitro, Galphimia glauca extract inhibits growth of colon cancer cells (27801).\nAntiprotozoal effects\nIn vitro, quercetin, a constituent of Galphimia glauca, exhibits weak antiprotozoal activity against Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei brucei, and Leishmania donovani (27803).\nCardiovascular effects\nAqueous extracts of Galphimia glauca leaves and flowers inhibit norepinephrine-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta, producing vasorelaxation (12979).\nCNS effects\nIn human and animal research, Galphimia glauca and its constituents galphimine A, galphimine B, galphimidin, galphimidin B, and glaucacetalin E have anxiolytic effects (26542, 26543, 26544, 108505). Extracts from the aerial parts of Galphimia glauca have sedative effects in animal models, including prolonging pentobarbital-induced sleep time in a dose-dependent manner (27807, 108505). The norsecotriterpenes galphimine B and galphimine E have been identified as sedative constituents of Galphimia glauca (26550, 27808). Galphimine B also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and spasmolytic activity (26542, 26543, 26544, 26550, 27801, 27809, 27810, 108505). It selectively inhibits dopaminergic neurons in rats, acting on dopaminergic synapses in the ventral tegmental area by a non-GABAergic mechanism (27801, 27811). However, glaucacetalin E, galphimidin B, and galphimidin increase sedative and hypnotic latency, and decrease the duration of pentobarbital-induced sleep (108505).\n\nIn animal models of schizophrenia, a methanol extract of Galphimia glauca, a galphimine-rich fraction, and galphimines A, B, and E all counteract apomorphine-induced acute psychosis with stereotyped behaviors and increased grooming (108504). When MK-801, an antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, is given daily for 28 days it increases immobility time, and this effect is blocked by galphimine B given from day 9 to day 28. MK-801 also reduces social interaction, an effect which is blocked by the galphimine-rich fraction, and increases memory loss, which is blocked by the methanol extract and the galphimine-rich fraction (108504).\nCoagulation effects\nIn vitro, tetragalloyl quinic acid, an active constituent isolated from Galphimia glauca, suppresses thromboxane biosynthesis in human platelets (66969)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGamboge is a resin from Garcinia hanburyi. It contains caged polyprenylated xanthones and benzophenones (18, 110675). The xanthone gambogic acid is the primary active constituent, comprising 22% to 35% of the content (100589, 100591). Other xanthones isolated from gamboge include desoxymorellin, gambogenic acid, gambogenific acid, gambogenin, isogambogenic acid, isogambogenin, isogambogic acid, morellic acid, and morellin isomers (100591, 110675). Water processing of gamboge reduces the gambogic acid content (110675).\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that gambogic acid inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines, including those that are resistant to 5-fluorouracil. The apoptotic effects are thought to be due to activation of the JNK signaling pathway (100590). Additional in vitro research shows that xanthone constituents isolated from gamboge have cytotoxic effects against adenocarcinoma, cervical cancer, colon cancer, and liver cancer cell lines. Some of these constituents may have antiangiogenic activity, as demonstrated in zebrafish and through in vitro inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation. A specific xanthone known as gambogenin seems to exhibit these antiangiogenic effects with a lower potential for toxic effects when compared with gambogic acid (100591).\nAntifibrotic effects\nSome research suggests that gambogic acid might have a role in preventing or treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In vitro research shows that gambogic acid can decrease the proliferation of human lung fibroblasts. In a rat model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, gambogic acid seems to prevent pulmonary fibrosis. These effects may be explained by increases in vasohibin-1, decreases in vasohibin-2, and suppression of the TGF-beta1/Smad3 pathway (100589).\nLaxative effects\nGamboge is reported to have a strong laxative effect (18)."

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nOrally, GBL is metabolized to gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and therefore causes similar toxic effects, including death (10640). Large doses of GBL can cause hypotension, hypoxia, and bradypnea requiring mechanical ventilation, metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap, acute kidney injury, agitation, reduced levels of consciousness, and coma (105714, 105715). Many patients also present with co-ingestion of alcohol or other illicit substances (95127, 105714).\n\nThe fatal dose of GBL is unknown, although a range of 250-750 mg/kg has been suggested (95127). There are four published case reports of death due to GBL (95127, 95128). However, the actual death rate is known to be much higher, with at least 55 deaths attributed to GBL in the United Kingdom. In most cases, accidental death occurred in young adults who were using GBL recreationally as a single agent. There have also been reports of death in people using GBL in combination with alcohol or other illicit substances (95127).\nTreatment\nThere is no known antidote for GBL or GHB toxicity. Management includes supportive care for presenting symptoms, such as hypotension, bradypnea, or acidosis. Patients with reduced levels of consciousness and hypoxia are often mechanically ventilated (105714, 105715). However, a retrospective study shows that many patients can be successfully managed via non-invasive airway maneuvers and continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring (105714). Some researchers have suggested that naloxone may antagonize the effects of GHB; however, this has not been well studied and anecdotally naloxone has not been effective for treating GHB toxicity (3682).\n\nChronic users of GBL can also develop withdrawal symptoms, such as severe agitation and delirium, within 2-72 hours and may require treatment with long-acting benzodiazepines and/or first or second generation antipsychotics (95118, 95129, 105713, 105715). However, treatment with antipsychotics may worsen the severity of these symptoms in some patients (95129, 95135).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nGBL may avoid first-pass metabolism due to its lactone structure (5813). This can lead to higher serum concentrations of its primary metabolite, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), than with similar doses of pure GHB (5813). The time to peak plasma levels is 36-57 minutes (95127).\nDistribution\nGBL is lipophilic and can be absorbed into tissues (5813, 95127).\nMetabolism\nGBL is metabolized in the blood to GHB by lactonases or by hydrolysis (1430, 95127, 95132). GHB is converted in the brain to the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) (3699), and can also be metabolized to carbon dioxide after dehydration and oxidation to succinic acid (93819).\nExcretion\nThe elimination half-life of GBL is 30-52 minutes (95127). GHB and its metabolites are eliminated in the urine (93819).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGBL is a partial GABA receptor agonist. It is metabolized to gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a potent sedative with direct GABA agonist activity (1430, 95132).\nEndocrine effects\nGamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a metabolite of GBL, stimulates growth hormone secretion during slow wave sleep (5804).\nNeurological effects\nGBL may have direct GABA agonist activity (5802), although the GABA antagonist bicuculline only partially reverses GBL-induced inhibition of apomorphine activity (5810). GBL is metabolized to gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), which in turn is converted in the brain to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter with sedative activity (3699). GHB also appears to act directly on the nervous system. Specific GHB uptake systems, transport systems, and receptors have been identified (713, 3699, 5800, 5801). Stimulation of GHB receptors reduces dopamine release in the brain (713, 3699, 5801), which may be the mechanism for GBL-induced reductions in dopamine neuronal impulse flow (5811). GBL has also been reported to inhibit stereotyped behavior induced by dopamine agonists (5810, 5811). Amphetamine, an indirect dopamine agonist, has been reported to partially reverse the neurologic effects of GBL (5810).\n\nGBL, possibly through conversion to GHB, also affects the endogenous opioid system. The opiate antagonists naloxone and naltrexone attenuate or abolish the electrical seizure activity, behavioral abnormalities, and increased striatal dopamine content produced by GBL (5812). GHB has been shown to induce REM and non-REM sleep, hypothermia, and EEG abnormalities similar to those seen in petit mal epilepsy (5800, 5803). Chronic exposure to GHB can downregulate endogenous GABA receptors, leading to a reduction in GABA-mediated inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitters during withdrawal from GBL (95118)."

It is unclear if oral GABA is beneficial for epilepsy.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of GABA 2.5-3 grams and phosphatidylserine 500 mg daily for 3-8 months reduces seizure frequency when compared with placebo in patients with absence seizures, but not in those with focal aware or focal impaired awareness seizures (19364). Other preliminary clinical research suggests that taking GABA 3 grams with phosphatidylserine 600-1200 mg daily for 2 days does not affect the seizure photosensitivity range in people with photoconvulsive responses (5113).\nless\nHypertension. Preliminary clinical research suggests that oral GABA may modestly reduce blood pressure in patients with mild or borderline hypertension.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with hypertension shows that drinking 100 mL of fermented milk containing GABA 10-12 mg daily at breakfast for 12 weeks reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 17 mmHg and 7 mmHg, respectively, when compared with baseline. Compared with patients treated with a placebo milk, these reductions were significant. However, it is unclear if the placebo milk also differed from the fermented milk in other ways (19367). Other preliminary clinical research in patients with borderline hypertension shows that taking a chlorella supplement containing GABA 20 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (19368). However, these findings are limited by poor study design.\nless\nInsomnia. It is unclear if oral GABA is beneficial for insomnia.\nTwo small clinical studies in adults with insomnia show that taking fermented rice germ extract, standardized to provide GABA 75 mg or 300 mg, one hour before bedtime for 4 weeks modestly decreases sleep latency when compared with placebo, but does not improve sleep efficacy or reduce episodes of waking after sleep onset (110134, 110135). As these doses were evaluated in separate studies, no direct comparison between GABA 75 mg and 300 mg has been conducted.\n\nGABA has also been evaluated as part of a combination product. A small clinical trial in adults with self-reported poor sleep quality shows that taking GABA 100 mg along with extracts of Poria mushroom and zizyphus orally daily for 4 weeks modestly improves sleep duration and sleep quality scores when compared with placebo (115660). It is unclear if this effect is due to GABA, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMeningitis.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Distribution\nSome evidence suggests that GABA does not cross the blood-brain barrier in notable amounts following oral or systemic administration (51120). However, other research shows that GABA does cross the blood-brain barrier. In addition, evidence from animal research suggests that phosphatidylserine may allow GABA to cross the blood-brain barrier (51153, 90570). Human research shows that after 95 days of supplementation, GABA plasma concentrations are not elevated, suggesting that GABA does not accumulate in the plasma and is rapidly cleared due to metabolism or distribution to tissues (112830).\nMetabolism\nGABA is catabolized by the enzymes GABA-transaminase (GABA-T) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) (51163). GABA-T is widely distributed and catalyzes GABA degradation via transamination to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), which is further catabolized to succinate by SSADH. Succinate is then able to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Outside of the central nervous system (CNS), GABA is primarily catabolized in the liver (51157).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nIn the central nervous system (CNS), GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. It acts on GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors (51163). It is synthesized in the brain by the decarboxylation of glutamate by glutamic acid decarboxylase (5109, 5110, 51163). GABA is found in the diet in germinated cereals, such as brown rice and barley, germinated beans, such as adzuki, mung, and soy, and microorganisms, such as some bacterial strains (105179, 105180). GABA also occurs naturally in a number of fermented food products, including fermented cabbage (kimchi) (51128, 51134), fermented milk (19367), and fermented fruit juice (51140).\nAnticarcinogenic effects\nGABA-enriched defatted rice germ has been shown to reduce chemically-induced colonic neoplasias in rodents (51118, 51117). However, the mechanisms of this anticarcinogenic effect are unclear.\nAnticonvulsive effects\nGABA exerts anticonvulsant effects at the cellular level (5109, 5110). Consequently, GABAergic drugs, or those that enhance GABA activity, are used to treat epilepsy (51152). Although, some evidence from animal research suggests that GABA alone does not attenuate penicillin-induced epileptic activity, GABA appears to attenuate penicillin-induced epileptic activity when used in combination with phosphatidylserine (51153). Thus, clinical studies have examined combinations of GABA and phosphatidylserine for the treatment of epilepsy (5113, 19364).\nAntidepressant effects\nIn animal research, providing foods enriched in GABA had antidepressant effects (105179, 105180). These foods included enriched soybeans and a milk fermented with adzuki bean sprouts and Bifidobacteria breve J1 (105179)(105180). The mechanism of action was found to be related to the GABA(B)-cyclic AMP-protein kinase A response element binding protein signaling pathway (105179). In one study, levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HTP), norepinephrine, and dopamine were increased in the hippocampus (105179). In another study, levels of corticosterone and serotonin were normalized (105180).\nAntihypertensive effects\nEvidence from clinical research suggests that taking GABA can decrease blood pressure (19367, 19368). Also, antihypertensive effects of GABA-enriched tomatoes (51148), green tea (51164), rice (51141), soybeans (51126), and fermented milk (51125) have been demonstrated in animal research. The exact mechanism of GABA's antihypertensive effect is unclear. Some evidence from animal research suggests that GABA may inhibit angiotensin II- but not angiotensin I-converting enzyme (51125, 51160). However, other animal research suggests that GABA's hypotensive effect may be due to increased sodium excretion (51131).\nAnxiolytic effects\nGABA exerts sedative and anxiolytic effects at the cellular level (5109, 5110). Although endogenous GABA has well-established relaxant effects (51152), the effects of exogenous GABA are not as clear, as it is unknown whether supplemental GABA crosses the blood-brain barrier (90570). However, some evidence from clinical research suggests that taking GABA 50 mg orally may induce a \"lack of alertness\" in healthy female patients (51159). However, intravenous doses of GABA (0.1-1.0mg/kg) have been shown to induce anxiety, dysphoria, and mood disturbance in a dose-dependent manner (5116).\nAppetite effects\nIn mice, a single 20 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg dose of GABA given orally immediately before feeding decreases food intake by approximately 15% during the first 30 minutes following administration when compared with saline. However, giving GABA 30 minutes prior to feeding did not affect food intake. Effects on food intake are thought to be due to activation of vagal afferent nerves by GABA (110133).\nDry skin\nIt is unclear if oral GABA is beneficial for dry skin.\n\nA small clinical trial in adults with self-reported skin issues, such as dry skin, shows that taking GABA 100 mg, poria cocos extract, and ziziphus spinose extract orally daily for 4 weeks modestly improves skin dryness scores and other skin quality scores when compared with placebo (115660). It is unclear if this effect is due to GABA, other ingredients, or the combination.\nEndocrine effects\nIn healthy volunteers, a single 5-gram dose of GABA increased growth hormone (GH) levels, but administration of GABA 18 grams daily for 4 days decreased GH and increased serum prolactin (5115, 51135, 51162). The mechanism by which GABA increases GH is unclear.\n\nIn healthy adults, single oral doses of GABA 5 or 10 grams increase levels of C-peptide, insulin, and glucagon, but do not affect serum glucose (5114). Animal research in rats with chemically-induced diabetes shows that injecting intraperitoneal GABA 1.5 grams/kg daily for 20 weeks improves serum blood glucose and insulin resistance when compared with insulin 2.5 units/kg daily or control. These improvements were also demonstrated in the offspring of these rats (109012).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nThe GABA(A) receptors have an established physiological role in sleep. Many sedative pharmacological agents used to treat insomnia target GABA(A) receptors (51143). Additionally, some clinical research shows that taking non-alcoholic hops increases GABA levels in the brain and helps with sleep (90567). GABA agonists appear to exert sleep-promoting effects at the hypothalamus, a region of the brain associated with sleep (51133). The effects of GABA supplements are not as clear, as it is unknown whether exogenous GABA crosses the blood-brain barrier (90570).\n\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with depression has found that increases in plasma GABA levels may be associated with very short-term improvement in response to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, these associations have not been consistently replicated (109010, 109011). The effects of exogenous GABA treatment on depression, alone or in combination with SSRIs, have not been studied.\nNeuroprotective effects\nGABA may have neuroprotective effects. In animal research, the excessive release of neurotoxic glutamate after cerebral ischemia was ameliorated by exogenous GABA, presumably through the increased activity of the GABA(B) receptor (51132)."

A specific prescription product containing the sodium salt of GHB, known as sodium oxybate (Xyrem, Jazz Pharmaceuticals), is FDA-approved for use in the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. It is unclear if GHB supplements are beneficial for this condition.\nThe sodium salt of GHB, known as sodium oxybate (Xyrem), is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients 7 years of age or older with narcolepsy. It is taken orally as a total nightly dose of 4.5-9 grams in adults and about 2-9 grams (depending on body weight) in children weighing 20-45 kg, with half of the dose taken at bedtime and the other half taken 2.5-4 hours later (102834). Clinical research shows that taking GHB 25 mg/kg at bedtime and repeated 3 hours later orally improves overnight sleep quality and reduces cataplexy in people with narcolepsy (3683, 3689, 3690, 3691, 3692, 93820). A meta-analysis of 15 placebo-controlled studies shows that taking GHB 3-9 grams for 4-8 weeks improves daytime sleepiness, inadvertent naps, nocturnal awakenings, and stage 1, slow-wave, and REM sleep. It also reduces cataplexy attacks, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis, and improves quality of life (102833).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAlcohol use disorder. Intravenous GHB seems to be beneficial in patients with alcohol use disorder. The benefits of oral GHB for this purpose are unclear.\nClinical research in patients with alcohol use disorder shows that intravenous administration of GHB 50-150 mg/kg daily in 3-6 divided doses orally or 50-100 mg/kg daily in 4 divided doses for up to 7 days under strict medical supervision reduces alcohol withdrawal symptoms. GHB also appears to be useful for treating alcohol dependence (3684, 3686, 3696, 93824, 93825, 93827). Some preliminary clinical research in patients with alcohol use disorder that have previously undergone detoxification shows that GHB is at least as effective as diazepam and possibly more effective than clomethiazole, naltrexone, and disulfiram for treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome and preventing relapse (93824, 93825, 93827). However, studies are generally small and poorly reported (93824).\n\nA large clinical study in patients with alcohol use disorder abstinent for 3-14 days shows that taking an abuse- and misuse-deterrent formulation of the sodium salt of GHB, sodium oxybate, 0.75-2.25 grams three times daily for 12 weeks in an outpatient setting has no effect on the percentage of days abstinent from alcohol use when compared with placebo. However, a post-hoc subgroup analysis found benefit in those with more severe alcohol use disorder at baseline (107800). The validity of these findings is limited by an unusually high placebo response.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDepression.

It is unclear if oral GHB is beneficial in patients with fibromyalgia.\nA very small, exploratory clinical study in patients with fibromyalgia shows that taking GHB nightly reduces fibromyalgia-associated pain, fatigue, and alpha sleep anomaly and increases slow wave sleep when compared with baseline (711). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nIntracranial hypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral or intravenous GHB for intracranial hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GHB for this purpose.\nMuscle strength. Although there has been interest in using oral GHB for muscle strength, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GHB for this purpose.\nObesity. Although there has been interest in using oral GHB for weight loss in patients with obesity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GHB for this purpose.\nOpioid withdrawal. It is unclear if oral GHB is beneficial in patients with opioid use disorder.\nA small clinical study in patients with opioid use disorder, including those with heroin use disorder and those undergoing methadone maintenance therapy, shows that taking GHB 25 mg/kg as a single dose suppresses most withdrawal symptoms, except diarrhea and insomnia, within 15 minutes, with effects lasting from 30-120 minutes, compared with no effect on any withdrawal symptoms with placebo (3695). It is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate GHB for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nAcute GHB toxicity can present with agitation, coma, cardiac arrest, delirium, hypotension, hypoxia, memory loss, seizures, slow or fast respiratory and heart rates, pale skin, and reduced or alternating levels of consciousness (93830, 107794, 107795, 110445). In a retrospective observational study of 327 cases of GHB poisoning where GHB was consumed as an intoxicant, nearly 50% of cases required hospitalization. GHB is often co-ingested with alcohol and stimulants, including cocaine and amphetamines, so clinical presentation may be obscured (107794, 107796, 110444). A steep dose-response curve exists with GHB, meaning that a small increase in dose can lead to disproportionate increases in toxicity (107794, 107796).\n\nGHB and the chemically-related products gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol, which are rapidly converted to GHB in the body, have been associated with at least 122 reports of serious adverse reactions including death (4259, 10658, 93824, 107794, 107796). At least two deaths involved the use of GHB and alcohol. Death occurred less than 24 hours after ingestion and was due to circulatory and respiratory collapse. The amount of GHB consumed in these two cases is unknown; however, the GHB levels in blood and urine were significantly elevated (6016).\n\nGHB can cause dependence requiring inpatient detoxification. Symptoms of withdrawal can start a few hours after the last dose (93833, 107799). Withdrawal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, delirium with auditory and visual hallucinations, insomnia, panic, psychoses, terror, anxiety, rhabdomyolysis, fever, and tremor (6612, 6613, 10656, 10658, 93823, 107799, 110445). One large observational study in inpatients with GHB use disorder with withdrawal symptoms, who were managed with tapered prescription GHB, has found a lack of association between vital sign stability and both subjective and objective withdrawal symptoms over the withdrawal period, suggesting that vital signs are not a suitable method for monitoring withdrawal in such patients (107799).\nTreatment\nTreatment of acute toxicity with GHB involves supportive care, with monitoring of respiration and circulation. Agitation often necessitates sedation. There is no known antidote (107794, 107795). Anecdotally, naloxone is not effective for treating GHB poisoning (3682).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing oral intake of GHB, plasma levels peak between 25-60 minutes and then fall rapidly over 6 hours with a half-life of 20-50 minutes (93818, 93819, 93821, 93822, 93831, 93832, 102831). A rise in GHB levels can be detected in the blood in as little as 5 minutes after a dose (93832). After a 50 mg/kg dose of GHB in healthy adults under the age of 45, plasma levels are 54-100 mg/L at 1 hour, and 7.2-49.7 mg/L at 3 hours. GHB is no longer detectable 6 hours after the dose (102831). The level of GHB found naturally in the blood is 6 mg/L or less (93822).\n\nHigher doses of GHB used in animal research are associated with more prolonged absorption and half-life (93821).\nDistribution\nSpecific uptake and transport systems have been identified for GHB in the brain (3699, 5800), and specific GHB receptors have been identified. GHB is taken up in the brain by monocarboxylate transporters (93821).\n\nHair analysis can be used for determination of GHB levels for several weeks after ingestion (93822).\nMetabolism\nGHB is metabolized rapidly, eventually to carbon dioxide (93821). The pathway includes dehydration and oxidation to succinic acid, and entry in the citric acid cycle or beta-oxidation to carbon dioxide and water (93822).\n\nIn the brain, GHB can be converted to GABA (3699, 10658).\nExcretion\nSmall amounts of GHB are excreted in the urine with the majority within 3 hours after intake (93818). After use, GHB can be measured in the urine for up to 12 hours (93826). Low doses of GHB are metabolized to carbon dioxide and exhaled (93821).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGHB occurs naturally in several areas of the brain, with the highest concentrations found in the basal ganglia. It is also found in other tissues including kidneys, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and brown fat (3699, 3682, 10658). In the brain, it is formed as a metabolite of the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and can also be converted back to GABA during metabolism (3699, 10658).\nAlcohol and drug withdrawal effects\nGHB is thought to have an ethanol-mimicking action on the central nervous system (93825). Studies in rats indicate that a cross-tolerance can develop between GHB and ethanol with chronic exposure, leading to investigations of GHB for management of ethanol dependence and withdrawal (3686). Efficacy has also been reported in the management of opioid withdrawal (3694, 3695).\nAnabolic effects\nGHB stimulates growth hormone secretion which occurs during slow wave sleep (5804); this has led to claims of anabolic effects (3688). The stimulation of growth hormone release is antagonized by flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) and metergoline (a serotonin receptor antagonist) (5806).\nAntioxidant effects\nGGHB is involved in preventing the production of, and scavenging, oxygen-derived free radicals in the brain (3682, 5805).\nMemory effects\nAnimal research suggests that GHB may cause memory impairment by inducing neurotoxicity and hypoxic stress in the hippocampus (102832). Memory impairment has also been reported in people who have had 4 or more GHB-induced comas. In research comparing GHB users with a coma history with those without, the former had impaired performance on memory tests, and reduced brain activity on MRI in the left hippocampus and left lingual gyrus during the tests (102832).\nMood effects\nIn healthy men, GHB increased vitality and reduced inhibition, overall promoting prosocial behavior without affecting cognitive function. Mechanisms of action are possibly related to GHB/GABA-B receptors and increased progesterone levels. Other hormones do not appear to be involved (93819). The effects on mood may be dose dependent. In healthy adults, a dose of 0.32 gram/70 kg increased friendliness. However, higher doses either had no effect or increased confusion and sedation while decreasing friendliness and mood (93828). Other research confirms the dose-dependent effects of GHB on mood, such as euphoria, and also suggests a peak approximately 45 minutes after use (93818). On the other hand, drowsiness and sedation peaked between 1-1.5 hours after use and lasted approximately 3 hours (93818).\nNeurological effects\nGHB is an agonist at GABA-B receptors and is also converted to GABA (713, 5801, 5802, 102830). Another GHB metabolite, gamma butyrolactone (GBL) may also have some GABA agonist activity (5802). GHB has also been reported to affect the endogenous opioid system, raising dynorphin levels (3682, 5803). Stimulation of GHB receptors results in a reduction in dopamine release in the basal ganglia (713, 5801, 10658), and it also influences dopamine release in the substantia nigra (3699). The CNS depressant effects of GHB, seen particularly at higher doses, are attributed to direct agonist effects on GABA-B receptors (102831).\n\nSome of the effects of GHB are antagonized by the opioid antagonist, naloxone and anticonvulsant drugs (5800). GHB also appears to influence serotonin turnover, but not levels, and inhibits the release of norepinephrine (93828).\n\nA small clinical study in patients who have used GHB has found that a history of multiple (i.e., at least 4) GHB-induced comas, but not use of GHB in general, is associated with anatomical, microstructural differences in white matter, specifically in parts of the corpus callosum linked to goal-directed behavior, associative memory, and affect regulation, as well as increases in self-reported impulsivity. Patients with a history of multiple GHB-induced comas used higher doses of GHB chronically and used more ecstasy and sedatives than those who used GHB in general (107797).\nPerformance effects\nHealthy adults under the age of 45 years who do not use GHB regularly have impaired driving performance on a simulator 1 hour after a GHB dose of 50 mg/kg orally. Driving is erratic, with weaving and speed variability, and there is an increase in collisions and off-road accidents. There is no significant impairment at 3 hours and 6 hours after the dose (102831).\n\nGHB prolongs reaction times and also affects performance on tasks in standardized tests. It disrupts self-performance monitoring and the ability to detect errors made, possibly via effects on the dopaminergic system. However, GHB does not seem to affect performance on tests where the most appropriate response must be selected from conflicting alternatives (102830).\nSleep effects\nGHB induces REM and non-REM sleep, hypothermia, and abnormalities on the EEG similar to those seen in petit mal epilepsy (5800, 5803). It also decreases brain glucose utilization (3683), lowers cerebral energy requirements, and may play a neuroprotective role against the effects of anoxia or excessive metabolic demand (3682, 5800, 5803). It has been suggested that the natural function of GHB may be to induce and maintain physiological states such as sleep and hibernation in which energy utilization is depressed (5803). The effects of GHB on sleep have been used to improve nighttime sleep quality, sleep continuity, stage 3 and 4 sleep, and cataplexy in people with narcolepsy, with some studies also reporting a reduction in the number of daytime sleep attacks (3689, 3690, 3691, 3692)."

Conversely, one small open-label clinical trial in infants with atopic dermatitis shows that taking GLA 3 grams daily for 4 weeks might reduce redness, itching, and use of antihistamines when compared to baseline (51042). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of placebo control.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oral GLA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating GLA, fish oil, and antioxidants, provided as a specific enteral formula (Oxepa, Abbott Nutrition) or a combination supplement given as a bolus, shows that there is no effect on overall all-cause mortality or ventilator- or ICU-free days when compared with generally isonitrogenous and isocaloric control formulas. A subgroup analysis of lower quality research shows that there may be a modest benefit for patients with a higher risk of mortality (105250). Two more recent meta-analyses have yielded similar results. Although most of the studies included in these meta-analyses investigated the use of Oxepa, some studies investigating other sources of enteral or intravenous fish oil were also included (105248, 105249). In one of these analyses, some low- to very low-quality evidence suggests that use of Oxepa modestly reduces mortality at 28 days, as well as ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation (105248). However, these benefits were not found in the second meta-analysis (105249). It is unclear if GLA, when used alone, is beneficial in patients with ARDS.\nless\nAsthma. Oral GLA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with asthma shows that taking 10 grams of a medical food emulsion providing GLA 0.75 grams with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0.5 grams, or 15 grams of a medical food emulsion providing GLA 1.13 grams with EPA 0.75 grams, daily for 4 weeks does not improve self-reported overall symptoms of asthma and bronchodilator use at 2 or 4 weeks when compared with placebo. Another small clinical study shows that taking medical food EFF1009, providing GLA 0.75 grams and EPA 0.5 grams, daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces bronchodilator use and improves quality of life and symptoms such as wheezing when compared to baseline (105251). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group and a high dropout rate.\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral GLA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in drug-naïve children ages 6 to 12 years with mild to moderate ADHD shows that taking GLA 60 mg in combination with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) daily for 12 months results in some small beneficial effects on inattentive symptoms when compared with placebo. However, these changes are unlikely to be clinically useful. Also, there was no change in blood levels of fatty acids (111058). The effect of GLA itself is unclear from this study.\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. Although there has been interest in using oral GLA for autism spectrum disorder, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GLA for this purpose.\nBack pain. Oral GLA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical trial in patients with back pain due to compressive radiculopathy syndrome shows that taking GLA 360 mg and alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 6 weeks while undergoing rehabilitation therapy reduces pain intensity and improves disability status when compared with rehabilitation therapy alone (20489). It is unclear if these findings are due to GLA, alpha-lipoic acid, or the combination.\nless\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral GLA is beneficial in patients with breast cancer.\nA small clinical study in patients with various stages of endocrine-sensitive breast cancer shows that taking GLA 2.8 grams daily along with tamoxifen for 6 weeks seems to improve the response to tamoxifen when compared with tamoxifen alone (5902).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral GLA for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GLA for this purpose.\nHypertension. Oral GLA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in patients with modestly elevated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) shows that taking a combination of GLA 0.12 grams plus eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0.48 grams does not reduce DBP when compared with olive oil (13771). However, another small clinical study in patients with hypertension shows that taking 4 grams of an oil preparation rich in GLA, EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) daily for 6 weeks reduces DBP when compared with sunflower seed oil (51022). It is unclear if these findings are due to GLA, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMastalgia. Oral GLA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small preliminary clinical trial in patients with mastalgia shows that taking GLA 100 mg daily in combination with vitamin C and vitamin B12 as methylcobalamin for 12 weeks does not improve the proportion of patients with minimal or no pain when compared with taking placebo (111059).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Although there has been interest in using oral GLA for menopausal symptoms, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GLA for this purpose.\nPressure ulcers. Oral GLA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with acute lung injury shows that taking a specific enteral emulsion (Oxepa, Ross Laboratories) providing GLA from borage oil along with fish oil and vitamins A, C and E for 7 days does not improve the healing of existing pressure ulcers when compared with a control enteral formula. Although the number of pressure ulcers in the group given the GLA-containing formula was lower when compared with the control formula, these patients also had fewer pressure ulcers at baseline and no statistical comparison was conducted. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear (105252).\nless\nPsoriasis. Although there has been interest in using oral GLA for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GLA for this purpose.\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although there has been interest in using oral GLA for RA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of GLA for this purpose.\nRosacea. It is unclear if oral GLA is beneficial in patients with rosacea.\nA small clinical study in adults with rosacea shows that taking GLA (Evoprim) 320 mg daily along with minocycline 50 mg twice daily for 8 weeks improves patient satisfaction and measures of skin hydration and increases the rate of treatment success, defined as an investigator global assessment score of 1 or lower, indicating clear or minimal symptoms, by 2-fold when compared with placebo plus minocycline (107927).\nless\nScleroderma. It is unclear if oral GLA is beneficial in patients with scleroderma.\nA small clinical study in patients with scleroderma shows that taking GLA (dose unknown) for 6 months does not reduce symptoms of scleroderma when compared with placebo (1977).\nless\nUlcerative colitis. Oral GLA has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with ulcerative colitis shows that taking a combination of GLA 1.6 grams, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 270 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 45 mg daily for 12 months does not reduce symptoms when compared with placebo (51013).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate GLA for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGLA is an omega-6 fatty acid, derived from the seeds of plants such as evening primrose and borage (7701).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGLA can be converted to compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties (1975). Some research suggests that dihomogammalinolenic acid, a metabolite of GLA and precursor of prostaglandin E1, might act directly on T-cells to modulate immune response in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (7701). There is also some evidence that GLA might reduce interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) auto induction, which is thought to be the cause of synovitis in patients with RA (8134).\nAnticancer effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests GLA can hasten the response to tamoxifen (Nolvadex) in individuals with estrogen-sensitive primary breast cancer (5902). GLA might have an antiestrogenic effect. It seems to modulate the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel (Taxol) and fulvestrant (Faslodex), enhancing malignant cell killing without adverse effects on normal cells (8133, 11791). However, other research suggests that GLA alone can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells at low concentrations and inhibit growth at higher concentrations (11339).\nCardiovascular effects\nSome evidence suggests that GLA might lower plasma triglycerides, increase HDL cholesterol, and prolong bleeding time (1979). Animal research shows that GLA can attenuate blood pressure response to chronic stress (51036).\nGastrointestinal effects\nEpidemiological research suggests that increased serum levels of GLA might be related to decreased risk for atrophic gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Further study is needed to confirm this observation and to determine a mechanism of action (8709).\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nGLA is believed to benefit individuals who have ischemic lesions associated with systemic sclerosis (1977) and individuals with diabetic neuropathy (1980, 1981)."

            "Overview": "Gamma-oryzanol is a group of constituents derived primarily from rice bran oil. It makes up about 1% to 2% of this oil. It is also found in wheat bran and some fruits and vegetables (755, 51077).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Gamma-oryzanol 300 mg daily has been used most commonly in clinical research without reports of adverse events (751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 51111). ...when used topically and appropriately (51112).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nGamma-oryzanol is generally well tolerated. No adverse effects have been reported. However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDyslipidemia. Small studies show that oral gamma-oryzanol might decrease total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in patients with dyslipidemia.\nMost clinical research in patients with dyslipidemia, comprised of small clinical studies, shows that gamma-oryzanol 100-300 mg daily for up to 2-6 months decreases total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, although effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are mixed (752, 757, 51108, 51109).\n\nGamma-oryzanol as a component of rice brain oil has also been evaluated. While rice bran oil has been shown to lower lipid levels, it is unclear if gamma-oryzanol content alters outcomes (51066, 100481). One small clinical study in males with mild hypercholesterolemia shows that consuming rice bran oil containing a high amount of gamma-oryzanol (0.8 grams daily) as part of the diet for 4 weeks lowers LDL and total cholesterol to the same degree as rice bran oil low in gamma-oryzanol (0.05 grams daily) (51066). However, another small clinical study in patients with hyperlipidemia shows that taking rice brain oil 30 mL containing 8000 or 11000 ppm gamma-oryzanol daily for 4 weeks decreases LDL-C levels to a greater extent than oil containing 4000 ppm gamma-oryzanol (100481).\n\nAdditionally, gamma-oryzanol has been studied in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical evidence in patients with dyslipidemia shows that taking gamma-oryzanol 40.2 mg with vitamin E 4 mg, omega-3 fatty acids 1100 mg, and niacin 18 mg daily for 4 months reduces LDL cholesterol by an additional 23 mg/dL when compared with vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids (51073).\n\nAnother clinical study in adults with mild dyslipidemia shows that taking a supplement (Rossopuro Forté, Giellepi) with gamma-oryzanol (unspecified dose), gamma-aminobutyric acid, and red yeast rice daily for 3 months modestly decreases LDL and total cholesterol and increases HDL when compared with placebo (116156). It is unclear if these effects are due to gamma-oryzanol, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAthletic performance. Although there is interest in using oral gamma-oryzanol to improve athletic performance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gamma-oryzanol for this purpose.\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if topical gamma-oryzanol is beneficial for eczema in children.\nA small clinical study in children shows that bathing in bathwater containing 20 mL of a solution containing gamma-oryzanol 0.5% daily for up to 6 months appears to improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis when compared with baseline (51112). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHypertension. Oral gamma-oryzanol has only been evaluated in combination with sesame oil; its benefits when used alone are unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hypertension shows that using a 20:80 blend of sesame oil and gamma-oryzanol-rich rice bran oil (Vivo, Adani Wilmar) as cooking oil for 8 weeks improves blood pressure and lipid profile. In patients using a low dose of nifedipine, 20 mg daily, adding the oil blend seems to further reduce blood pressure when compared with nifedipine alone (96180).\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral gamma-oryzanol is beneficial in the treatment of menopausal symptoms.\nA single-center, observational study in adults in China with perimenopause syndrome taking an estradiol/progesterone combination suggests that adding gamma-oryzanol 30 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces severity of patient-reported menopausal symptoms (e.g., headache, hot flashes, insomnia, nervousness) when compared with control (116157).\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral gamma-oryzanol is beneficial for improving muscle strength.\nPreliminary clinical research in well-trained male athletes over 40 years old shows that taking gamma-oryzanol 500 mg daily for 9 weeks while participating in a resistance exercise program does not improve muscle strength or vertical jump power when compared with placebo (751). Conversely, a small clinical study in young healthy males shows that taking gamma-oryzanol 600 mg daily for 9 weeks during resistance training modestly increases muscular strength when compared with placebo (100482).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate gamma-oryzanol for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGamma-oryzanol is a group of constituents derived primarily from rice bran oil. It is also found in wheat bran and some fruits and vegetables. It makes up about 1% to 2% of rice bran oil (755, 51077). Major components of gamma-oryzanol include cycloartenyl ferulate, 24-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate, and campesteryl ferulate (51056).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn an animal model, gamma-oryzanol reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as inerleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and increases anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 (116158).\nAnticancer effects\nIn animal studies, gamma-oryzanol has shown antitumor effects (35813, 51098).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal models show that a diet high in gamma-oryzanol from rice bran oil increases insulin sensitivity when compared with control (51075).\nAntihyperlipidemic effects\nSince gamma-oryzanol is poorly absorbed from the gut, researchers think it might help lower cholesterol by decreasing cholesterol absorption from the gut (755, 756). In vitro research shows that gamma-oryzanol inhibits uptake of cholesterol into intestinal epithelial cells, and may inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity also decreases cholesterol content in the liver, increasing uptake of cholesterol from the blood by liver cells and further reducing cholesterol levels (100486).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal and in vitro studies show that gamma-oryzanol reduces oxidation of lipids and cholesterol (51059, 51071, 51072). It also has a high capacity for trapping peroxyl radicals (51064).\nErgogenic effects\nAged mice fed gamma-oryzanol 0.02% in the diet for 13 weeks show increased grip strength and improvements in running endurance, maximum speed, and distance covered when compared with those fed a normal diet. The mice fed gamma-oryzanol have larger muscle mitochondria which are not atypical or swollen, as is normally associated with aging. Gamma-oryzanol inhibits inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1-beta, and IL-6 which cause muscle weakness, and it also upregulates oxidative muscle fibers, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Expression and activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, and estrogen related receptor (ERR)-gamma are increased by gamma-oryzanol. PPAR-gamma induces local production of adiponectin in myocytes, improving insulin sensitivity of muscle tissue. Muscle ERR-gamma is normally induced by exercise, increasing peak oxidative capacity and muscle mitochondrial function (108944).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn animal models, gamma-oryzanol reduces the incidence of stress-induced ulcers (51089). It seems to lower levels of gastrin, preventing increased secretion of gastric juice which exacerbates gastrointestinal ulcers (51058). Additionally, oryzanol supplementation in a rat model of drug-induced ulcerative colitis ameliorates the increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines and their mRNA expression and the increases in bacteria associated with proinflammatory responses while simultaneously enriching the microbiome with beneficial bacteria (111423). Supplementation also ameliorates damage to the integrity of the gut barrier, including preserving goblet cells, in this rat model.\nHormonal effects\nClinical research suggests that gamma-oryzanol increases levels of estradiol and decreases luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in perimenopausal adults (116157). Although gamma-oryzanol has been used to increase testosterone and growth hormone levels, it seems to have no effect on these hormone levels in vivo (751). Parenteral administration of gamma-oryzanol in animals produces an anti-anabolic state by suppressing release of LH and increasing release of catecholamines, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain (755). If this occurs in humans, gamma-oryzanol might reduce testosterone production (755). There is some evidence gamma-oryzanol can reduce elevated serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in hypothyroid patients, possibly by a direct action on the hypothalamus (753).\nNeurological effects\nIn an animal model of spinal cord injury, gamma-oryzanol reduces spinal cord lesion size and improves motor function (116158).\nWeight loss effects\nAnimal research shows that consuming gamma-oryzanol reduces fat gain in mice and rats fed a high-fat diet with or without high fructose levels (100498, 100499). It might reduce fat accumulation by suppressing the development of adipocytes. In vitro research with adipocytes shows that gamma-oryzanol decreases lipid accumulation and reduces glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, which suppresses adipocyte differentiation (100494)."

The fruit rind is rich in hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which is thought to be the main active principle. HCA has four isomeric forms; the isoform that is primarily found in garcinia fruit and most often used in clinical studies is (-)-HCA (51176, 88159). HCA is also found in the calyxes of some Hibiscus flowers (26195, 26852, 26854). However, dietary supplements usually source HCA from garcinia.",

There are numerous case reports of elevated liver enzymes and symptoms of liver toxicity in patients who have taken garcinia alone or in combination with other ingredients for as little as one week. In at least two reports, hepatotoxicity occurred in patients who were taking garcinia alone. Most other reports occurred in patients taking multi-ingredient products (13037, 53511, 93380, 93381, 93384, 93385, 93392, 93393, 93394, 96535)( 102544,102545,111241).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, garcinia and its constituent, hydroxycitric acid (HCA), seem to be generally well tolerated in clinical research.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Diarrhea, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, and nausea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Garcinia has been linked with cases of hepatotoxicity and liver failure. There have also been rare cases of mania and pancreatitis.\nCardiovascular\nThere is a case report of a 48-year-old female who developed acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis (ANEM) after using a garcinia supplement orally for 2.5 weeks. On admission to hospital, she was hypotensive and had an elevated serum troponin level, progressing to fulminant heart failure, acute kidney failure, and sustained ventricular arrhythmias. She recovered after treatment with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and high-dose corticosteroids (88160). Although the patient had no prior medical history and was not taking any medications, this cannot conclusively be attributed to garcinia.\n\nWhen taken orally, a specific formulation of the multi-ingredient product Hydroxycut (Iovate Health Sciences Inc.), which was available until 2009, has been associated with malignant hypertension and hypertensive retinopathy. Hydroxycut contains caffeine, garcinia, gymnema, green tea, glucomannan, guarana extract, and willow bark. The suspected causal agent is caffeine, which is dosed at 600 mg daily if Hydroxycut is taken as recommended; however, the responsibility of the other ingredients cannot be ruled out (16527).\nless\nEndocrine\nIn one case report, a 56-year-old female with pre-existing diabetes, hepatitis C, and hypertension developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and pancreatitis after taking an unknown amount of garcinia and African mango for one month. Upon admission, she presented with altered mental status, elevated serum glucose and lipase, and high anion gap metabolic acidosis. After 3 days of intensive supportive care, the DKA and pancreatitis resolved. The suspected probable causal agent was garcinia; however, African mango cannot be ruled out (97341). There have been at least 3 other cases of acute pancreatitis associated with use of garcinia (unknown dose) for 2 weeks and up to 7 months in adults ages 36-82 years (105056, 105058, 105071).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, garcinia and its active constituent hydroxycitric acid (HCA) have caused mild and infrequent nausea, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms (728, 11977, 19153, 88158, 88159).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, garcinia and its constituent hydroxycitric acid (HCA) might cause liver toxicity. Several cases of acute liver toxicity have been reported in patients taking garcinia supplements (93392, 93393, 93394, 95573, 102544, 102545, 104431, 111241). Reported doses of garcinia extract range from 480-1800 mg daily, providing up to 900 mg HCA daily (93392, 93394, 95573, 102544, 104431). However, not all experts agree that HCA plays a causal role in the hepatotoxicity associated with garcinia supplements; some suggest other mechanisms may be in play, such as immune-mediated processes (95576, 108401). In most cases, patients presented with a hepatocellular pattern of toxicity and symptoms of abdominal pain, coagulopathy, jaundice, and elevated transaminases after taking garcinia for several weeks to several months (93393, 93394, 95573, 102544, 102545, 104431, 108401, 111241). In most of these cases, there was no evidence of other natural causes of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis. Some of these patients used acetaminophen at recommended doses for limited durations, suggesting that a potential synergistic effect may occur when multiple hepatotoxic agents are used concomitantly.\n\nThe Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network has identified 22 cases (11 moderate; 7 severe) of liver injury from garcinia, with 5 cases occurring with garcinia alone, 16 cases occurring in combination with green tea, and 1 case occurring in combination with ashwagandha. Clinical presentations of liver injury related to garcinia closely resemble green tea-related liver injury. Most patients (82%) presented with a hepatocellular pattern of enzyme elevations. The median age of these case reports was 35 years, 41% identified as Hispanic, and most patients were overweight but not obese. In case reports involving garcinia alone, the carrier frequency on HLAB*35:01 was 60%, which is higher than the carrier frequency found in reports of liver injury due to other supplements (19%) and in population controls (11%). Within 3 months of injury onset, 1 patient required liver transplantation and 1 patient died from liver injury (108401).\n\nThere have been at least four cases of liver failure requiring transplantation associated with garcinia supplements (93392, 95573, 98425, 104431). In one case related specifically to garcinia, a 52-year-old female had been taking a combination product (USA Nutra Labs) providing garcinia 1000 mg daily, standardized to 60% HCA. The supplement also provided calcium 50 mg, chromium 200 mcg, and potassium 50 mg. Symptoms started within a few weeks of initiation of the product (93392). In another case, a 34-year-old Hispanic male experienced acute liver failure requiring transplant after taking a specific garcinia product (Garcinia Cambogia 5:1 Extract, Swanson Vitamins) 160 mg three times daily before meals for 5 months (95573). In other reports, one 26-year-old male and one female presented to the emergency room with liver failure after 2-7 months of taking a supplement containing garcinia and green tea, with or without whey protein, Veldt raisin, and coffea arabica (98425, 104431).\n\nThere have also been numerous cases of acute liver toxicity associated with combination products containing garcinia, such as Hydroxycut (Iovate Health Sciences Inc) (13037, 53511, 93380, 93381, 93384, 93385, 96535, 98425, 104431). Available until 2009, Hydroxycut contained garcinia, green tea, chromium, caffeine, calcium, potassium, and gymnema. A currently available garcinia-containing combination product called Seryburn Day Triple has also been associated with supplement-induced liver injury. (13037, 93380, 93381, 95570, 95572, 95575, 111241). In most of these cases, patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes without evidence of chronic liver disease. Patients usually developed symptoms within 1-12 weeks of taking the product. The clinical pattern of liver damage was often hepatocellular. Most cases reported altered liver enzyme values including ALT, AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and international normalized ratio. In most cases, symptoms resolved with near normalization of enzyme levels once the garcinia-containing combination product was discontinued (13037, 53511, 93380, 93381, 93384, 95567, 95572, 95575, 111241).\n\nHowever, there is one report of transplant related to Hydroxycut use (93381). As the suspected causal agents, garcinia and green tea were removed from the product during reformulation in 2009 (13037, 53511, 93380, 93381, 93384). Hepatotoxicity has been reported in at least one new formulation of Hydroxycut not containing garcinia (93394). Consequently, some experts believe that there is not enough information to attribute hepatotoxicity from this product to garcinia or HCA (95576). Also, in some cases, causality of hepatotoxicity was less clear because patients were taking many other supplements and drugs (95570).There is also a report of fatal liver failure in an obese female taking montelukast while also taking two dietary supplements containing multiple ingredients, including garcinia, gymnema, chromium, bitter orange, and many others. The authors speculated that the combination of montelukast with one or more ingredients in these dietary supplements may have resulted in liver failure (93385).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, garcinia-containing products have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. There is a case report of a patient who developed rhabdomyolysis 3 hours after ingestion of an herbal product containing ephedra, guarana, chitosan, gymnema, garcinia, and chromium (19154). Since there were multiple ingredients, the effect cannot be conclusively attributed to garcinia. Another case of rhabdomyolysis has been reported for a patient taking an undetermined formulation of Hydroxycut at a dose of 4 caplets daily, naproxen sodium 220 mg as needed for pain, dextroamphetamine daily for 5 days, and hydrocodone-acetaminophen and cyclobenzaprine for pain. Two weeks later, after stopping Hydroxycut and receiving supportive care, the rhabdomyolysis resolved. Hydroxycut was determined to be possibly associated with the rhabdomyolysis (95566). Since Hydroxycut contains multiple ingredients and garcinia content was possible but not confirmed, a causal relationship with garcinia could not be determined.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, garcinia and its active constituent hydroxycitric acid (HCA) may cause headache and dizziness (11977). A 35-year-old female reported ocular complications, headache, dizziness, and nausea after taking garcinia extract, providing more than 500 mg of HCA, three times daily for one week. The patient's neurologic symptoms resolved one day after discontinuing the garcinia extract (102546). It is unclear if these neurologic adverse effects were separate from or related to the patient's visual disturbances.\nless\nOcular/Otic\nIn one case, a 35-year-old female presented with ocular pain in both eyes, decreased vision in the left eye, headache, dizziness, and nausea after taking garcinia extract orally for one week. Ophthalmologic testing was consistent with adverse ocular effects, showing myopic shift with anterior chamber shallowing and swelling of retinal nerve fiber and macula. The patient reported taking a garcinia product containing hydroxycitric acid 500 mg three times daily, which was more than double the recommended dose per the product label. Symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of the garcinia extract and treatment with oral and topical steroids (102546).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, garcinia supplements have been linked to several cases of mania. Typically, symptoms develop 1-8 weeks after starting garcinia. In a report of three patients, symptoms included reduced need for sleep, increased activities and spending, delusions of grandiosity, pressured speech, and agitation. Two of the patients were previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and use of garcinia was believed to precipitate episodes during stable phases of the disease. The third patient had no history of bipolar disorder, and use of garcinia was thought to possibly have unmasked previously undiagnosed primary bipolar disorder. In all three cases, recovery included discontinuation of garcinia (95568). In a separate case report, a 23-year-old male taking a specific combination product containing garcinia (Hydroxycut) 1-2 capsules daily for 1 month presented to the emergency room with mania. The patient had no history of bipolar disorder. Although the patient was started on risperidone and clonazepam, symptoms resolved following discontinuation of the supplement. Treatment was discontinued within 4 days of initiation, and the patient remained asymptomatic (95574). A 22-year-old female with no history of bipolar disorder developed mania and psychosis, presenting 10 days after starting Garcinia Cambogia Plus (Apex Vitality Health) 500-1500 mg daily, and Cleanse and Detox (Apex Vitality Health). The latter supplement contains raspberry ketones, licorice root, pumpkin seed, buckthorn root, Cascara sagrada, Irvingia gabonensis, rhubarb, pectin, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and aloe. Symptoms improved upon stopping the supplements and starting lithium and quetiapine (99421).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral garcinia is beneficial for improving athletic performance.\nTwo very small, exploratory studies in untrained females and in elite athletes show that taking hydroxycitric acid (HCA), the active ingredient of garcinia, 250 mg daily for 5 days increases time to exhaustion and lowers the respiratory exchange ratio when compared with taking placebo (19151, 26858).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral garcinia is beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia.\nA small open-label study of adults with obesity shows that taking garcinia 600 mg twice daily for 3 months may reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides when compared to baseline (111243). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of a comparator group and blinding.\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral garcinia is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nA small clinical study in females with obesity and NAFLD shows that taking a specific product containing garcinia bark leaf extract (HCA Garcinia Vita Plus, Vitamin House) 312.5 mg daily for 8 weeks in combination with a calorie-restricted diet improves body weight, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared to baseline. However, liver enzyme levels increased slightly (111240). While a calorie-restricted control group was included, a lack of appropriate statistical comparison limits the validity of any between-group findings. Thus, it is unclear if these results are due to garcinia, the calorie-restricted diet, or the combination.\nless\nObesity. Despite contradictory evidence, oral garcinia seems to produce a very modest weight reduction in some people who are obese or overweight.\nA meta-analysis of 8 small clinical trials shows that taking garcinia for 8-12 weeks seems to reduce weight by about 1.3 kg and body mass index (BMI) by about 1 kg/m2 when compared with control (104432). This analysis is limited by prominent heterogeneity in the included studies and a lack of sensitivity analyses. Most studies included in the analyses used garcinia 1000-4667 mg (standardized to 50% or 60% hydroxycitric acid) in divided doses daily as non-branded extracts or as specific branded supplements (Super CitriMax, InterHealth Nutraceuticals; Citrin, Sabinsa Corporation) (728, 19152, 19153, 88158, 104432). It is unclear which dose, if any, may be most beneficial.\n\nMore recently, a small, open-label trial in adults with obesity shows that taking garcinia 600 mg twice daily for 3 months reduces body weight and BMI by 1.7 kg and 0.7 kg/m^2 when compared to baseline (111243). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of a comparator group and blinding. Limited research has also studied garcinia in combination with glucomannan for 6 months, with evidence of moderate benefit for weight loss (96536).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate garcinia for these uses.",

It is unclear how this reduced absorption may alter the clinical effects of HCA.\nStandardization & Formulation\nGarcinia extract is often standardized to content of hydroxycitric acid (HCA). Most products used in clinical research have been standardized to contain 50% to 60% HCA (728, 8572, 11407, 19152, 19153, 88158).",

            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nBIPOLAR DISORDER\nGarcinia might exacerbate mania in patients with bipolar disorder. Several cases of mania have been reported in patients who took garcinia supplements daily for 1-2 months prior to symptom development. Some of these patients had a history of bipolar disorder, while others did not (95568, 99421).\nless\nLIVER DISEASE\nTheoretically, garcinia might worsen liver damage in patients with existing liver disease and should be avoided. Garcinia, either alone or in combination with other ingredients, has been associated with acute hepatitis. The damage has resulted in increased levels of aminotransferases up to 70-fold above normal. In rare cases, liver transplant has been required. Most cases have resolved once the product was discontinued (13037, 53511, 93380, 93381, 93384, 93392, 93393, 93394, 102544, 102545).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with garcinia.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral administration of hydroxycitric acid (HCA) 2 grams in humans, plasma concentrations of HCA were 0.8 mcg/mL after 30 minutes and 8.4 mcg/mL after 2 hours (26875). Food appears to reduce the absorption of HCA. A clinical study in healthy females shows that taking a single dose of garcinia extract 1500 mg containing HCA 750 mg results in a 2-fold lower maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and a 3-fold lower area under the curve (AUC) of serum HCA during a well-fed state when compared with a fasted state (105037).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of the plant is the fruit and fruit rind. Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is the principal acid in garcinia fruit rind. Smaller amounts of citric, tartaric, and malic acids are also found (51176).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nHCA may have anti-inflammatory effects. Animal research shows that HCA reduces the expression of inflammation-related genes and reduces inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 levels (26863, 102380).\nAntidiabetic effects\nAnimal research shows that HCA reduces insulin resistance and lowers fasting plasma insulin and glucose levels in diabetic mice (26863). Other animal research shows that HCA decreases the absorption of glucose in small intestinal tissue and improves glucose tolerance in rats (26867, 26868).\nAntiplatelet effects\nIn vitro, HCA decreases acetyl-CoA content in platelet cytoplasm and suppresses malondialdehyde (MDA) synthesis and platelet aggregation (26862).\nAthletic performance effects\nHCA is theorized to improve exercise endurance by increasing lipid oxidation and decreasing carbohydrate and glycogen utilization (4487). This seems to occur because HCA increases plasma free fatty acid levels, decreases carbohydrate oxidation, and increases fat oxidation during moderate-intensity exercise (26856, 19151, 26858).\nBody weight effects\nThere is interest in using garcinina and its constituent, hydroxycitric acid (HCA), for weight loss. In vitro, HCA competitively inhibits adenosine triphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase, which is involved in the conversion of carbohydrate to fat (lipogenesis). Inhibition of this enzyme prevents cleavage of citrate to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, limiting the availability of acetyl-CoA for lipogenesis (728, 51176, 88161, 111243). By this mechanism, HCA limits biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol in a variety of tissues (88159, 111242).\n\nHowever, research in humans is conflicting. One small study in sedentary lean males following a high-carbohydrate diet for 7 days shows that taking HCA seems to lower non-protein respiratory quotient and net fat synthesis, but not overall weight gain, when compared with placebo (26859). However, another small study in sedentary males shows that taking HCA after fasting overnight does not alter acute respiratory quotient, fat oxidation, or energy expenditure at rest or after exercise when compared with placebo (51170). Another theory is that HCA might reduce net-calorie intake by reducing appetite and increasing satiety.\n\nAnimal research suggests that HCA increases the release and availability of serotonin in the brain, which is involved in appetite control (88159, 88161). HCA is also thought to increase rates of hepatic glycogen synthesis, which influences glucoreceptors in the liver to increase satiety (88159). Additionally, animal research suggests that HCA promotes both down- and up-regulation of various fat- and obesity-related genes, as well as the transactivation of hypoxia inducible factor (26861).\nHematological effects\nGiving rats garcinia dried seed extract 200 to 400 mg/kg daily for 5 weeks is associated with a significant increase in red blood cell (RBC) count. This might be due to the iron and antioxidant content of garcinia seeds, which leads to increased production and average life span of RBCs (88159).\nHepatotoxic effects\nThere have been reports of acute hepatitis with elevated liver enzymes associated with garcinia, when taken alone or in combination with other ingredients (13037, 53511, 93380, 93381, 93384, 93392, 93393, 93394, 102544, 102545)(111240). The mechanism of action is not clear, however, in animal research, garcinia has been shown to induce liver fibrosis, possibly related to inflammation and increased oxidative stress (93393).\nLipid effects\nPreclinical studies suggest that garcinia may improve lipid profiles. In a rat model of diabetes, administration of garcinia extract for 21 days reduces total serum cholesterol when compared with placebo and metformin. Researchers theorize that flavonoids found in garcinia inhibit HMG-CoA reductase (111242). A hepatic metabolic computational model simulating HCA effects on adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase activity found reductions in triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol after HCA administration (111243).\nPsychiatric effects\nHCA in garcinia inhibits serotonin reuptake and inhibits the activity of acetylcholinesterase, potentially causing serotonergic and muscarinic effects such as mania, psychosis, and serotonin syndrome (99421). Also, animal research shows that taking HCA orally upregulates certain genes that encode serotonin receptors (26874).\nRenal effects\nIn an animal model, HCA reduced calcium oxalate crystals, as well as markers of oxidative stress and renal impairment (102380).\nSleep effects\nAnimal research in mice suggests that garcinia may increase sleep latency and decrease non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in a dose-dependent manner, with an oral dose of 1500 mg/kg determined to be equally effective as oral caffeine 25 mg/kg in a phenobarbital sleep test. Effects from caffeine and garcinia lasted approximately 6 and 2 hours, respectively. In both groups, administration for 3 weeks did not illicit symptoms of tolerance or withdrawal; additionally, no changes in delta activity were observed during non-REM sleep (108402)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of garden cress are the above ground parts, root, and seed (18, 110892, 110893, 110899, 110901). Garden cress contains glucosinolates (110897) and phenolics including ferulic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, resveratrol, quercetin, and others (110895). The juice contains benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), a breakdown product of the garden cress constituent glucotropaeolin (51185). Compounds in garden cress seeds include n-hexadecanoic acid, thiocyanic acid, phenylmethyl ester, 2- furancarboxaldehyde, 5-(hydroxymethyl), levoglucosenone, rotoxamine, and gamma-tocopherol (108701).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn animal research, garden cress leaves and seeds exhibit hypoglycemic activity (51193, 105745, 108929, 110893, 110902, 115616). Animal research suggests that oral administration of ultrafine garden cress powder and garden cress extract for 4 weeks lowers blood glucose and improves insulin resistance in a rat model of diabetes (105745). Potential mechanisms of action for its hypoglycemic effects include inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption and/or a mechanism independent of insulin secretion (51190, 51193).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, garden cress leaf and seed have antibacterial and antifungal activity (110892). This activity might be dependent on the age of the plant at harvest (18).\nAntiobesity effects\nIn a rat model of obesity, oral administration of garden cress seed reduces body weight (115617).\nAntioxidant effects\nAnimal research suggests that oral administration of the seeds or above ground parts of garden cress improves the antioxidant capacity by increasing concentrations of the major reactive oxygen species scavengers catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase. Additionally, concentrations of the oxidation products lipid peroxide and malondialdehyde were reduced (105745, 110902).\nAntiviral effects\nIn animal research, garden cress has demonstrated antiviral activity against the encephalitis virus Columbia SH (18).\nCardiovascular effects\nAnimal research suggests that oral administration of ultrafine garden cress powder, garden cress extract, or garden cress seed for 4 weeks improves lipid parameters in a rat model of diabetes (105745, 115616). Additionally, oral and topical administration of garden cress seed reduces lipid biomarkers in a rat model of obesity (115617).\nHair growth effects\nIn a rat model of androgenic alopecia, application of garden cress seed extract improves 5-alpha reductase and growth factor levels when compared with minoxidil (115619).\nHepatic effects\nIn an animal model of obesity, oral and topical administration of garden cress seed improves alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (115617).\nImmune effects\nIn animal research, garden cress essential oil demonstrated immunostimulatory effects via increasing humoral antibody titer levels, spleen index, and thymus index (115618)."

The pigmentation was thought to be due to melanin deposition enhanced by genipin, a constituent of gardenia. The patient gradually improved over 9 months after stopping this treatment (102698).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, there are case reports of mesenteric phlebosclerosis, a thickening of the walls of the intestine and mesenteric veins, which can lead to obstruction and occlusion. Typical presenting symptoms are paroxysmal abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, and imaging studies reveal thickening and stiffening of the walls of the ascending and transverse colon, with dark purple discoloration of the colonic and rectal mucosa, and linear calcification of the mesenteric veins. Treatment is supportive and conservative, leading to a slow resolution of signs and symptoms. In one case a 61-year-old female had been taking a Chinese herbal combination containing extracts of gardenia fruit, Baikal skullcap root, goldthread, phellodendron bark, honeysuckle, rhubarb, anemarrhenae, and trichosanthis root for 8 years (112954). In another case, a 77-year-old female took a product containing extracts of gardenia fruit, phellodendron bark, and licorice for 7 years. Mesenteric phlebosclerosis is thought to be caused by genipin, formed from geniposide after hydrolysis by intestinal bacteria. It is absorbed from the intestine, reacting with proteins in mesenteric veins, leading to progressive fibrosis, calcification, and venous occlusion (102698, 112954).\nless\nImmunologic\nTopically, exposure to gardenia fruit extract or the whole plant has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis (26518, 49078).\nless",

A small quantity is hydrolyzed in the gut to crocetin, which is absorbed (26529).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of gardenia is the fruit. Identified constituents of gardenia include iridoid glycosides (geniposide, gardenoside, gentiobioside, gardaloside, jasminoside G, ixoroside, and shanzhiside), genipin, crocetin and its esters (crocin-I and crocin-II), and chlorogenic acid (26520, 26521, 26522, 26523, 26525, 26526, 26528, 26529, 72463, 112949).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGardenia is traditionally used for inflammatory conditions. Animal research suggests that an extract from gardenia fruit containing geniposide and genipin displays anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenan-induced paw edema (26522, 26530). Other animal research shows that geniposide reduces levels of pro-inflammatory markers at wound sites (109599). Gardenia fruit extract increases levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF-beta and interleukin (IL)-4, and decreases levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1-beta. It also inhibits inflammatory responses by increasing PPAR-gamma expression in nuclei and reducing it in the cytoplasm, and suppresses the proinflammatory effect of nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B (112953).\nAnticarcinogenic effects\nGardenia is traditionally used for cancer. Animal research shows that the gardenia constituent geniposide and its penta-acetyl geniposide have antitumor activity against glioma cells (26521).\nAntidiabetes effects\nGardenia is traditionally used for diabetes. Animal research shows that gardenia extracts reduce fasting blood glucose (112949). They reduce insulin resistance and protect against impaired glucose tolerance (26525). In vitro research shows that the gardenia constituents geniposide and crocin-I, and a gardenia extract, gardenia yellow, standardized to contain 90% crocin and 9% crocetin, inhibit alpha-glucosidase, slowing the digestion of starch and absorption of glucose (109598, 112949).\nCognitive effects\nAnimal research suggests that gardenia extract might have neuroprotective effects. In a mouse model of Alzheimer disease, gardenia crocins improve cognitive functioning and decrease beta-amyloid levels via suppression of neuroinflammation and inhibition of phosphorylation of tau proteins (109597). In rat models of vascular dementia, a gardenia extract, 10-50 mg/kg orally, reduces learning and memory defects. It increases cerebral blood flow, inhibits apoptosis, reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress-related protein expression, alleviates neuronal injury and loss in the hippocampus and cortex, and has anti-inflammatory activity. The extract regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) to inhibit microglial activation, and changes the microglial phenotype from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2, reducing neuro-inflammation. It also suppresses a signaling pathway involving protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha-kinase (elF2-alpha), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (112952, 112953).\nDermatologic effects\nCrocetin from gardenia fruit extract has melatonin-like binding affinity in vitro. Exposure to blue light from electronic devices for at least 4 hours daily is thought to accelerate skin aging by delaying the melatonin cycle. In females with this type of exposure, applying a 2% gardenia fruit extract cream to the face twice daily for 56 days decreases facial wrinkles by about 20% when compared with placebo. In vitro, the extract shows absorption in the blue range of the spectrum, has protective effects on the mitochondrial network of human dermal fibroblasts, decreases oxidized proteins on human skin explants, and preserves the natural melatonin cycle in co-cultures of sensory neurons and keratinocytes (112955).\nHepatoprotective effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that a glycoprotein isolated from gardenia exhibits hepatoprotective effects. It appears to increase nitric oxide production and the activation of antioxidant enzymes (26540).\nImmunologic effects\nAnimal research shows that a gardenia extract without crocin inhibits an ovalbumin-induced IgE hypersensitivity response. Topical treatment with this extract for 11 days reduces levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE and T-helper cell type 2 cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13. It also suppresses chemokine ligands 5 and 22, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells are reduced in the spleen and lymph nodes. The reduced hypersensitivity response is due to inhibition of P38-mitogen-activated protein kinase, and STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-1) (112951).\nLipid effects\nIn animals on a high-fat diet, gardenia fruit extract improves dyslipidemia, with decreases in serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, but no effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (112953).\nMuscle effects\nAnimal studies show that a gardenia fruit extract given in a dose of 200 mg/kg daily for 10 days reduces muscle atrophy and associated protein degradation caused by dexamethasone. The mechanism involves reduced expression of NADPH oxidase, which is related to oxidative stress, and inhibition of a catabolic, proteolytic pathway involving AMP-activated kinase, sirtuin-I, proliferator activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1-alpha, and forkhead box 0 (112950).\nWound-healing effects\nGardenia is traditionally used for wound healing. In a rat model of diabetic wounds, geniposide, a constituent extracted from gardenia, improves wound healing, possibly through improved glycemic control and anti-inflammatory effects (109599)."

Intravenously, there is insufficient reliable information available about adverse effects.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain, body odor, flatulence, malodorous breath, and nausea. Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.\n\nTopically: Burns and dermatitis with fresh garlic.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Some case reports raise concerns about increased risk of bleeding with garlic.\nDermatologic\nOrally, garlic may cause pruritus (51316, 51474, 107239), flushing, and acne (107239). Oral intake of a specific garlic product containing allicin (Allimax) has been associated with a case of pruritic rash (51474). Enteric-coated garlic tablets standardized to 1.5% allicin have also been associated with a case of pruritus (51316). Garlic has also been associated with a case of superficial pemphigus in a 49-year-old male with type 2 diabetes (51564). Garlic-induced oral ulcers have also been reported (51467).\n\nTopically, garlic may cause contact dermatitis and urticaria (4833, 5004, 12635, 51258, 51265, 51375, 51403, 51412, 51459, 51483)(51511, 51512, 51530, 51616, 51617, 51618, 111769), as well as contact cheilitis (51384). Fresh garlic may be more likely to elicit a reaction than garlic extract. Most reactions have resolved following withdrawal of garlic therapy. In one case report, applying crushed garlic on the neck to help ease a sore throat resulted in an itchy, burning, erythematous lesion in a young female patient. The lesion healed after one week of treatment with topical antibiotics, steroids, and antihistamine ointments (88390). Cases of occupational eczema or dermatitis have been reported in cooks (51303, 51210), food handlers (51292), and caterers (51304). According to one case report, dermatitis appeared in chefs exposed to garlic (15033). Treatment with acitretin 25 mg daily or topical psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA) for 12 weeks proved effective in mitigating the symptoms. A 34-year-old female with a history of hand dermatitis and paronychia had a worsening of these conditions after peeling raw garlic. She had a positive skin patch test to fresh, raw garlic but not to any other tested allergens, and the conditions resolved when she avoided contact with garlic (105528). Topically, garlic may also cause chemical burns, usually within 12 hours of application. Second- and third-degree chemical burns have been reported in adults, children, and infants exposed to topical garlic, often as an unintended consequence of using garlic medicinally on the skin (585, 4832, 51226, 51230, 51252, 51281, 51377, 51418, 51468, 51495, 51536)(51558, 51576, 51577, 88409, 96006). A case of painful blisters on the soles of the feet of a 23-year-old Chinese female has been attributed to chemical burns caused by applying crushed raw garlic for 3 hours (51440). Topically, garlic may also cause hyperpigmentation, ulcers, necrotic lesions, facial flushing, and local irritation (4832, 15030, 51268, 51269, 108606). In one case report, applying crushed raw garlic to the palatal mucosa for several minutes to relieve mouth pain resulted in a chemical burn that produced a 3 cm necrotic ulcer in an adult female with trigeminal neuralgia (108606).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, dehydrated garlic preparations or raw garlic may cause malodorous breath (51438, 51444), body odor (732, 1873, 4784, 4793, 4795, 4798, 9201, 10787, 42692, 49769)(51269, 51316, 51467, 51602), abdominal pain or fullness, anorexia, diarrhea, constipation, flatulence, belching, heartburn, nausea, unpleasant taste, reflux, and bowel obstruction (1884, 6457, 6897, 9201, 49769, 51269, 51343, 51380, 51438, 51442)(51450, 51457, 51466, 51471, 51474, 51520, 51593, 51602, 51623, 88398)(88405, 111766, 114892).\n\nLarge quantities of garlic may damage the gastrointestinal tract. In one case report, a patient taking garlic for hypertension reported odynophagia and retrosternal pain after taking garlic without any water the previous day. An esophageal lesion 3 cm in length was detected upon endoscopy. The symptoms resolved 3 days after starting a liquid diet and taking lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily and sucralfate four times daily (88389). One case of bowel obstruction was reported in a 66-year-old male who ingested an entire garlic bulb (51525). Esophageal perforation has been reported in at least 17 individuals who consumed entire garlic cloves. In one case the perforation led to mediastinitis and death (102672).\n\nGarlic has also been associated with eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract. In one case report a 42-year-old female presented with symptoms of eosinophilic gastroenteritis, which included pollinosis, asthma, diarrhea, heart burn, peripheral eosinophilia, and urticaria. After stopping use of garlic and sesame, the patient improved (51441). In a case report of eosinophilic esophagitis, garlic was determined to be the causative agent in a patient with long-standing gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient had attempted to treat upper gastrointestinal symptoms as gastrointestinal reflux disease without success for many years. Skin prick testing showed a positive reaction to garlic, of which the patient noted frequent consumption. Marked symptom improvement was noted within 3 weeks of garlic avoidance (88393).\n\nIntravenously, garlic 1 mg/kg of body weight daily diluted into 500 mL saline and administered over 4 hours has been reported to cause abdominal discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, flatulence, weight loss, and garlicky body odor (51462).\n\nClinical research suggests that patients with metabolic syndrome taking 1600 mg of powdered garlic by mouth daily for 3 months may experience improved intestinal transit time when compared with placebo, suggesting that garlic powder may reduce symptoms of constipation (110722).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, garlic might cause dysuria, hematuria, or polyuria (51438, 51450, 51467, 113618). In one case, an older male with high dietary and supplemental garlic intake at doses of 300-5400 mg daily for 3-4 years developed severe hematuria with clots after undergoing a minimally invasive prostate procedure (113618).\nless\nHematologic\nOral use of dietary garlic or supplements containing garlic has caused platelet dysfunction, increased fibrinolytic activity, prolonged bleeding time, retrobulbar hemorrhage (bleeding behind the eye) postoperative bleeding, and spinal epidural hematoma (586, 587, 4801, 4802, 11325, 51397, 51473, 51491, 51532, 51534)(51570, 51584, 51593, 51594, 113618). Also, a case of kidney hematoma following extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL) has been reported in a patient with nephrolithiasis who took aged garlic (51630). A case of increased bleeding time that complicated epistaxis management has been reported in a patient taking garlic, aspirin, and milk thistle (51426).\n\nIntravenously, garlic has been associated with the development of thrombophlebitis at the injection site (51462).\nless\nImmunologic\nThere is a case report of an immediate sensitivity reaction to oral raw garlic, resulting in wheals, in a 31-year-old female. The patient did not react to cooked garlic, and skin prick tests showed allergy only to raw garlic (96015). Researchers note that at least some allergens in raw garlic are heat labile (88392, 96012, 96015). This suggests that consuming cooked rather than raw garlic may help avoid this reaction in patients allergic to raw garlic. However, different people react to different allergens in garlic. At least some of these allergens are heat stable (96012). While rare, garlic-induced anaphylaxis has been reported (88392, 96012).\n\nTopically, allergic contact dermatitis has been reported in case reports (51406, 51498, 51510, 51519, 51560).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, garlic has been associated with individual cases of gout and low back pain (51474, 51467), but it is not clear if these adverse events can be attributed to garlic.\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, dizziness, insomnia, headaches, diaphoresis, fever, chills, somnolence, increased appetite, euphoria, and weight loss have been reported with garlic (15032, 42692, 51316, 51467, 51471, 51520). In one case, the smell of garlic was identified as a trigger for migraines in a 32-year-old female. The subject reported fortification spectra along with visual spots for a few seconds followed by instantaneous biparietal, crushing level (10/10) headaches upon exposure to the scent of garlic or onion (88404).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nGarlic exposure, most notably in occupational settings, may cause asthma and other symptoms such as sneezing, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and sinusitis (40661, 51218). A case of minor hemoptysis has been reported for one patient with cystic fibrosis following intake of garlic capsules orally once daily for 8 weeks (51438). A 77-year-old female developed pneumonia related to the intake of one whole black garlic clove daily. The cloves were prepared by heating a whole garlic bulb in a pot for one month. Symptoms included dyspnea and coughing, and test results were positive for lymphocyte-induced stimulation by black garlic and raw garlic. The patient required treatment with oral steroids and was told to avoid garlic (96011).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAtherosclerosis. When used alone or in combination with other ingredients, oral garlic seems to slow the progression of atherosclerosis.\nTaking low doses of garlic powder (Kwai, Lichtwer Pharma) 300 mg, administered as a single dose or three times daily for up to 4 years, seems to lessen age-related decreases in aortic elasticity (4797, 51595). Additionally, taking a specific time-released garlic powder supplement (Allicor, INAT-Farma) 150 mg twice daily for 24 months seems to reduce the rate of atherosclerosis progression, as measured by carotid intima-media thickness, when compared with placebo in males with early evidence of carotid atherosclerosis (88394). Higher doses of 900 mg daily seem to slow development of atherosclerosis in both aortic and femoral arteries when used over a four-year period in females, but not in males (3315, 4798). In patients with evidence of coronary artery calcium and a Framingham risk score of greater than 10%, taking aged garlic extract (Kyolic Reserve, Wakunaga) 1200 mg twice daily for 12 months reduces coronary artery calcium progression by 29% when compared with placebo (102670). A meta-analysis also found that garlic powder tablets and aged garlic extract may reduce coronary artery calcium scores when compared with placebo (110721).\n\nSome clinical research has investigated the use of garlic in combination with other ingredients. Taking a specific supplement (Kyolic, Total Heart Health, Formula 108, Wakunaga) containing aged garlic extract 250 mg plus vitamin B12 100 mcg, folic acid 300 mcg, vitamin B6 12.5 mg, and L-arginine 100 mg daily for 12 months significantly reduces coronary artery calcium progression and improves vascular function in patients with a Framingham risk score of 10% to 20% without coronary artery disease (88385). In addition, taking a combination product containing aged garlic extract 1200 mg and coenzyme Q10 120 mg daily for one year significantly improves vascular elasticity endothelial function in firefighters facing high degrees of occupational stress (44225).\nless\nDiabetes. Most clinical research suggests that oral garlic, taken alone or in combination with metformin for at least 12 weeks, modestly reduces fasting blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. It is unclear if garlic improves postprandial glucose levels or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).\nA meta-analysis of results from seven clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking garlic powder 600-1500 mg daily, garlic oil 8.2 mg daily, or aged garlic extract 1000 mg daily reduces fasting blood glucose levels by about 2 mg/dL when compared with control. The greatest benefit is seen for patients with hyperglycemia at baseline, for interventions lasting at least 12 weeks, and for formulations consisting of garlic powder (96004). Specific garlic formulations used in the reviewed studies have included garlic powder 300 mg 2-3 times daily as tablets (Kwai, Lichtwer Pharmaceuticals) or time-released tablets (Allicor, INAT-Farma) for 4-24 weeks, sometimes in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea (51396, 51463, 96004). In one study, when used in combination with metformin, garlic reduced fasting blood glucose levels 70% more than when metformin was used alone (51463). The findings from these studies are in contrast with the results from older meta-analyses, which showed that garlic does not improve glycemic indices or lipid levels in patients with diabetes. Reasons for these discrepancies may relate to the fact that the older analyses included lower quality research (6465, 6897). There is insufficient reliable information available to determine if garlic significantly improves postprandial glucose levels or HbA1c (96004).\n\nA small clinical trial shows that taking aged garlic extract (Kyolic, Wakunaga) 2400 mg daily for 12 months does not reduce left ventricular myocardial mass, a marker of poor cardiac outcomes, in patients with diabetes. However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (102671).\nless\nEndometriosis. Oral garlic seems to improve pain in people with endometriosis.\nA clinical study in patients with endometriosis shows that taking a tablet containing garlic powder 400 mg, providing allicin 1.1 mg, daily for 3 months along with standard care reduces overall pain scores from baseline by 72%, compared with an increase of 4% from baseline in patients receiving placebo along with standard care (106615).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Most research shows that taking oral garlic for at least 8 weeks seems to modestly reduce total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and slightly increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidemia. However, evidence is conflicting on whether garlic reduces triglyceride levels.\nMeta-analyses of clinical studies in patients with hyperlipidemia show that taking garlic daily for 2-12 months reduces total cholesterol by about 15-25 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by about 6-17 mg/dL, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 1.5 mg/dL when compared with control (88399, 114891). Results regarding triglyceride levels are mixed, with one of these analyses showing a reduction of triglyceride levels of about 15 mg/dL and the other showing no reduction (88399, 114891). The impact on lipid levels appears to be more pronounced when garlic is taken for more than 8 weeks and in patients with total and LDL cholesterol levels that are at least borderline high before treatment (88399). Another meta-analysis supports prior findings that taking garlic improves HDL, LDL, and apolipoprotein-A levels while having no impact on triglycerides level. The meta-analysis found that while garlic does not appear to reduce cholesterol in the general population, it may reduce total cholesterol when taken by patients with cardiovascular risk factors (110721). Similarly, a meta-analysis of 17-19 clinical studies in healthy adults and patients with a variety of cardio-metabolic conditions, including hyperlipidemia, shows that taking garlic daily for 1-12 months reduces total cholesterol by about 14 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by about 8 mg/dL, increases HDL by about 2 mg/dL, but does not reduce triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (114890). Another partially conflicting meta-analysis found that garlic powder reduces total cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride levels, but has no impact on HDL levels (110720). The majority of available research supports these findings, but conflicting results exist (279, 731, 732, 1873, 1875, 4782, 4783, 4784, 4785, 4786)(4787, 4788, 4789, 4792, 4793, 4794, 4795, 4807, 6457, 6897)(51343, 15295, 15296, 51422, 51429, 51469, 51590, 88399, 107238)(107352, 110721).\n\nWhether garlic is beneficial for treating hyperlipidemia may also depend on the specific formulation or product taken. Mixed results have been reported for a variety of specific garlic products, including garlic powder tablets (Kwai, Lichtwer Pharma) 600-900 mg daily in two or more divided doses for 6-16 weeks (279, 731, 4782, 4783, 4784, 4785, 4787, 4789, 4792, 4793)(4795, 4807), aged garlic extract (Kyolic, Wakunaga) 1000-7200 mg daily in divided doses for 4-6 months (1873, 1875, 15295), a garlic powder product (Garlex, Bosch Pharmaceuticals) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks (51343), aged black garlic extract (ABG+; PharmActive Biotech Products) 250 mg daily for 6 weeks (108607), and others (732, 15295). Subgroup analyses from one meta-analysis suggest that products containing aged garlic extract may be more effective for lowering total cholesterol than garlic powder preparations. If garlic powder preparations are used, total cholesterol levels seem to be lowered to a greater degree in patients taking enteric-coated garlic powder tablets. The opposite trend may be true for reducing LDL cholesterol. Garlic powder tablets seem to reduce LDL cholesterol levels while aged garlic extract does not. However, the few studies that did evaluate the effect of aged garlic extract on LDL cholesterol did so in patients with low baseline LDL cholesterol levels. There is limited evidence on the use of raw garlic or garlic oil products for treating hyperlipidemia (88399). A subgroup analysis from another meta-analysis of clinical studies suggests that garlic oil reduces total and LDL cholesterol more effectively than garlic powder (114891).\n\nTaking garlic 1200 mg with fish oil 3 grams daily for 4 weeks or garlic oil 500 mg with fish oil 700 mg daily for 60 days also appears to improve lipid parameters in some patients (4789, 4790, 51669). Garlic alone may be more effective than garlic plus fish oil for improving LDL cholesterol levels, but the combination may be useful in patients with elevated levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (4789).\nless\nHypertension. Some clinical research suggests that oral garlic seems to modestly reduce blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive patients.\nOne meta-analysis of clinical studies show that taking garlic can reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 5 mmHg and 3 mmHg, respectively, in patients with or without hypertension (16605, 51414, 96007). However, another meta-analysis found that taking garlic may not impact systolic or diastolic blood pressure in patients with coronary artery disease when compared with placebo (110721). When only patients with hypertension are considered, taking garlic can decrease systolic blood pressure by about 7-9 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by about 4-6 mmHg. These results are limited by the fact that many of the included studies were of low to moderate quality and short duration (96007, 96008, 96014). Most clinical research appears to support these findings (278, 279, 1873, 51442, 88398). However, conflicting results exist (107238, 110721).\n\nSome garlic formulations evaluated for hypertension have included a specific garlic powder formulation (Kwai, Lichtwer Pharma) 2400 mg as a single dose or 600 mg daily for 12 weeks and a specific aged garlic extract (Garlic High Potency Everyday Formula 112, Wakunaga/Wagner) 960 mg to 7.2 grams daily in up to three divided doses for up to 6 months (278, 279, 1873, 51442, 88398). Other doses used in the available research have included garlic tablets 300-1500 mg in divided doses daily for 24 weeks (88386) and garlic oil 500 mg plus fish oil 600 mg daily for 60 days (51669).\n\nHypotensive effects of garlic have also been examined in population research. A large population study found that eating raw garlic at least twice daily is associated with a reduced likelihood of having prehypertension when compared with eating raw garlic three or fewer times per week. However, any significant relationship was eliminated after adjusting for dietary salt, making conclusions difficult (102677).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral garlic seems to reduce the severity of hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD.\nA meta-analysis including 4 studies with 186 patients with NAFLD found that taking 800-1600 mg of garlic powder daily may reduce aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) and lower the probability of hepatic steatosis by 2.75 times when compared with placebo (110720).\n\nClinical research in patients with NAFLD shows that taking garlic powder reduces the severity of steatosis in 51% to 62% of patients, compared to 16% to 26% of those taking placebo (102681, 103470). Doses of garlic included a specific powder (Amin Pharmaceutical Company) 800 mg twice daily for 12 weeks or an enteric-coated powder 400 mg twice daily for 15 weeks (102681, 103479). There was also an improvement in most liver enzymes, other than alkaline phosphatase, and the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (102681). In addition, population research shows a 7% reduction in odds of developing NAFLD with each 1 gram of raw garlic per 1000 kcal consumed. However, this association was not observed in females (102673).\n\nNAFLD is strongly and independently associated with an increased risk for prehypertension and hypertension. A clinical study in adults with NAFLD and stable diet- or antihypertensive-controlled blood pressure shows that taking an enteric-coated tablet containing garlic powder 400 mg (Amin Pharmaceuticals), providing allicin 1.5 mg, twice daily for 15 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure by 8, 3, and 6 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein is also reduced by 16% when compared with placebo (106614).\nless\nPeriodontitis. Oral aged garlic extract seems to improve some measures of gum health in people with mild to moderate periodontitis.\nClinical research in otherwise healthy patients with mild to moderate periodontitis shows that taking a specific aged garlic extract (Kyolic, Wakunaga) orally 1200 mg twice daily for 18 months improves probing pocket depth, but not gingival recession, when compared with placebo (105760). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of an intention to treat analysis.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nGastric cancer. Oral garlic does not seem to prevent gastric cancer.\nClinical research evaluating the effects of taking aged garlic extract for 7 years failed to show a reduced risk of developing gastric cancer up to 22 years later (14447, 51470, 102016), although there was a reduction in mortality associated with gastric cancer in subjects followed for 12-22 years (5-15 years after stopping the garlic extract) (102016). Also, a prospective, case-control study of 123,484 adults over a 30-year review period suggests that garlic intake, whether obtained from the diet or via supplementation, is not associated with a reduction in the rate of gastric cancer occurrence (97034). However, some research disagrees. One prospective population study suggests that a 1 kg/year increased increment in garlic intake is associated with a 17% reduced risk in gastric cancer incidence over 22 years. Also, consuming at least 3.25 kg yearly is associated with at least a 12% reduced risk when compared with consuming less than 2 kg each year. A sub-analysis suggests that this potential benefit is associated with garlic stalks, rather than garlic bulbs (111764). Meta-analyses of population research, as well as small population studies, have suggested 23% to 51% lower odds of developing gastric cancer with increased dietary garlic intake when compared with never eating garlic (3320, 4775, 4776, 51209, 51460, 96005, 108604). However, these studies have limited external validity.\nless\nHelicobacter pylori. Oral garlic does not seem to be beneficial for Helicobacter pylori eradication.\nDespite some promising initial laboratory research suggesting activity against Helicobacter pylori, garlic cloves, powder, or oil does not seem to have any beneficial effect when used to treat patients infected with Helicobacter pylori (3322, 4761, 4762, 4763, 4765, 4774, 97034).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for allergic rhinitis (hay fever), there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nAlopecia areata. Topical garlic may increase hair growth by a small amount.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with alopecia areata shows that applying garlic 5% gel four times daily for 3 months, in addition to topical corticosteroid use, increases hair growth by 18% when compared with placebo plus topical corticosteroid (51386).\nless\nAsthma. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for athletic performance.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a single dose of garlic 900 mg prior to exercise increases endurance when compared with placebo in young athletes (51623). A small preliminary clinical trial shows that taking garlic extract 1000 mg daily for 4 weeks does not reduce the time to cycle 40 km when compared to placebo (111765).\nless\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for BPH.\nIn patients with BPH, preliminary clinical research shows that taking aqueous garlic extract 1 mg/kg daily for one month decreases prostate mass and urinary frequency and improves symptom scores and urinary flow rates when compared to baseline (10374). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nBladder cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for bladder cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nBreast cancer. It is unclear if oral garlic prevents breast cancer.\nThe relationship between garlic intake and risk of breast cancer is unclear. Overall, population research suggests that taking garlic does not seem to decrease the risk of breast cancer. However, when garlic and onions are examined together, there is some evidence of an association with a decreased risk of breast cancer (4779, 102674). More research is needed.\nless\nBronchitis. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for bronchitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for reducing CVD risk factors in adults with hypercholesterolemia.\nA clinical crossover study in adults with moderate hypercholesterolemia shows that taking a specific product (ABG+; PharmActive Biotech Products) containing aged black garlic extract 250 mg, standardized to provide S-allyl-L-cysteine 1.25 mg, daily for 6 weeks does not improve blood pressure, glucose or cholesterol levels, or anthropometric measures when compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis in males with elevated diastolic blood pressure at baseline shows that taking this product reduces diastolic blood pressure by 5-mmHg when compared with placebo (108607). It is unclear if garlic is beneficial in patients with existing CVD.\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral garlic prevents colorectal cancer.\nSeveral individual population studies have found that higher dietary intake of garlic is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (3320, 4770, 4771, 4772). However, results from meta-analyses of population research are mixed (96003, 102669). Reasons for the discrepancy seem to relate to the type of population study conducted. A meta-analysis of case-control studies supports a preventative effect of garlic. However, this is not supported when cohort studies are analyzed separately (102669). Case-control studies are prone to recall and selection bias, and some do not account for confounding factors associated with colorectal cancer (96003). Two separate meta-analyses of observational research conducted in various countries have found that consumption of garlic and other allium-containing vegetables (onions, leeks, chives and scallions) is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer; however, subgroup analyses suggest improvement is greatest in studies conducted in Asian countries, modest in those conducted in North America, and absent in those conducted in Europe (108604, 108605). The reasons for these differing findings are unclear but may be related to regional differences in dietary habits, such as the use of raw or cooked garlic.\n\nFew studies have examined the effects of garlic supplements. While a single preliminary clinical study in patients with confirmed colorectal adenomas shows that taking high-dose aged garlic extract 2.4 mL daily for 12 months reduces the risk of developing new adenomas by 29% when compared with a lower dose of 0.16 mL daily (51320), other studies do not support the use of garlic supplements for this purpose (4773, 96003).\nless\nCommon cold. Oral garlic might reduce the frequency of the common cold when used prophylactically.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking one capsule of garlic daily for 12 weeks during the winter months reduces the number of self-reported colds by approximately 63% when compared with placebo. The duration of symptoms was also reduced by approximately one day (10787). Also, a small clinical trial in older patients living in residential care shows that 12% of those taking one capsule daily of a combination of garlic and onion powder (Aliocare, Domca Sau, Spain) for 36 weeks had one or more common cold episodes compared with 45% of those taking placebo. Each capsule provided 14 mg garlic powder (111768).\nless\nCorns. It is unclear if topical garlic is beneficial for corns.\nPreliminary clinical research in a small number of patients with corns shows that applying a lipid soluble garlic extract topically to corns on the feet twice daily for 10-20 days results in improvement in most patients when compared with baseline (15030). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nCoronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for CHD.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in adults with CHD shows that taking garlic orally 800-2000 mg daily for 2-48 weeks reduces total cholesterol levels by an average of 16 mg/dL when compared with placebo. Taking garlic did not affect other cholesterol levels; however, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. The validity of this study is limited by inclusion of patients with and without dyslipidemia at baseline (107238).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for COVID-19.\nClinical research in non-critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that taking garlic extract (Gallecina, Samisaz Pharmaceutical Company, Iran) 90 mg every 8 hours for 5 days or until discharge modestly reduces the proportion of patients requiring supplemental oxygen for at least 1 day when compared with placebo. However, there was no overall effect on clinical status, intensive care admission, or discharge prior to day 6. All patients also took remdesivir (111766). A small preliminary clinical study in patients hospitalized with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 shows that taking garlic essential oil orally 50 mg twice daily before breakfast and dinner for 10 days, in addition to standard COVID-19 treatment, reduces the median duration of fever from 5 to 4 days, cough from 7 to 5 days, and weakness from 9 to 7 days when compared with standard treatment alone. The median time to a negative COVID-19 test decreased from 8 to 7 days (109530). The validity of this study is limited by incomplete randomization, the lack of a placebo comparator, and the exclusion of people with severe symptoms.\nless\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for cystic fibrosis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking garlic oil macerate 625 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve pulmonary function, symptom scores, or the need for antibiotic therapy when compared with placebo in children with cystic fibrosis and chronic pulmonary infection (51438).\nless\nDental hypersensitivity. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for dental hypersensitivity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nDenture stomatitis. It is unclear if topical garlic as a mouthwash is beneficial for denture stomatitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with oral denture stomatitis shows that using a garlic mouthwash 40 mg/mL three times daily for 4 weeks improves redness when compared to baseline. When compared with nystatin, garlic has a lesser degree of recovery, but better patient satisfaction (51466).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for diabetic retinopathy.\nPreliminary research in patients with diabetic retinopathy and macular edema, treated with intravitreal bevacizumab and laser photocoagulation, shows that taking garlic powder 1 gram orally daily for 4 weeks improves the best-corrected visual acuity by 0.18 logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution), compared with 0.06 for placebo. It also decreases intraocular pressure by 1 mmHg, compared with 0.3 mmHg for placebo (109529).\nless\nDiarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for various types of diarrhea, including travelers' diarrhea and dysentery, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for these conditions.\nDysmenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for dysmenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for erectile dysfunction.\nA small clinical study in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) and poor response to tadalafil shows that adding fresh pressed garlic 5 grams in juice 150 mL twice daily for 4 weeks to a regimen of tadalafil 5 mg daily improves erectile function when compared with placebo plus tadalafil A subgroup analysis suggests that effects are clinically significant in patients with moderate ED but not severe ED (114892).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral garlic prevents esophageal cancer.\nObservational research regarding the use of garlic in preventing esophageal cancer is conflicting. Some evidence suggests that raw garlic consumption does not prevent the development of esophageal cancer (51508). However, other population research suggests that weekly garlic consumption decreases the risk of developing esophageal cancer (51209).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking allicin, a constituent of garlic, 80 mg daily for 14 days can reduce subjective assessments of exercise-induced muscle soreness in athletes when compared with placebo (51404).\nless\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia. Oral garlic does not seem to improve blood lipid levels in children with familial hypercholesterolemia.\nIn children with familial hypercholesterolemia, a small clinical trial shows that taking garlic powdered extract, standardized based on alliin content, does not improve levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein B-100, homocysteine, fibrinogen, or blood pressure (4796).\nless\nFatigue. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for fatigue, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nFibrocystic breast disease. Oral garlic has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (Karinat, INAT-Farma), containing garlic powder 150 mg, beta-carotene 2.5 mg, alpha-tocopherol 5 mg, and ascorbic acid 30 mg twice daily for 6 months reduces the severity of breast pain, premenstrual syndrome, and menstruation pain, and can cause regression of palpable symptoms of breast fibromatosis (51317). It is unclear if these effects are due to garlic, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nGastritis. Oral garlic has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with gastritis shows that taking a specific combination product (Karinat, INAT-Farma), containing garlic 150 mg, beta-carotene 2.5 mg, alpha-tocopherol 5 mg, and ascorbic acid 30 mg twice daily for 6 months improves digestion, inhibits H. pylori infection, and reduces the risk of precancerous lesion formation when compared with placebo (51308). It is unclear if these effects are due to garlic, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nGout. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for gout, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nHepatitis. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for hepatitis.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking 3-6 capsules of a product containing garlic oil 50 mg and diphenyl-dimethyl-dicarboxylate 25 mg per capsule daily for 6 weeks improves liver function enzyme levels when compared with placebo in patients with chronic hepatitis (51478). The effects of garlic alone have not been determined.\nless\nHepatopulmonary syndrome. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for hepatopulmonary syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that garlic oil (Garlic Pearls, Ranbaxy, India) 1-2 grams/m2 daily in two divided doses for 9-18 months may improve oxygen levels and remission rates when compared with placebo in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome (51439).\nless\nInfluenza. Oral garlic has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in older patients living in residential care shows that 12% of those taking one capsule daily of a combination of garlic and onion powder (Aliocare, Domca Sau, Spain) for 36 weeks had one or more influenza-like episodes compared with 36% of those taking placebo. Each capsule provided 14 mg garlic powder (111768).\nless\nLead toxicity. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for lead toxicity.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking garlic powder 400 mg three times daily for 4 weeks reduces blood lead concentration when compared with baseline, but not when compared to treatment with D-penicillamine, in patients with mild to moderate lead poisoning (51467).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral garlic prevents lung cancer.\nSome population research suggests that eating raw garlic is associated with a reduced odds of developing lung cancer. However, other research suggests that eating garlic or taking garlic supplements is not associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer (4778, 103482). Reasons for the discrepancy possibly relate to the type of garlic consumed.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Meta-analyses of small studies suggest that oral garlic may improve some metabolic parameters in patients with metabolic syndrome and other metabolic disorders.\nTwo meta-analyses of several small clinical studies in adults with metabolic syndrome or metabolic disorders including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes show that taking various forms of garlic improves triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure , measures of insulin resistance, and waist circumference when compared with control. However, the meta-analyses reach conflicting conclusions on whether garlic is beneficial for body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, or systolic blood pressure when compared with control. Garlic forms studied in the meta-analyses include raw garlic 5000-20,000 mg, aged garlic extract 240-6000 mg, garlic powder tablets 188-6000 mg, and garlic derivative ajoene 2.34 mg, taken daily for 4 to 36 weeks (113617, 113619).\nless\nMosquito repellent. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial as a mosquito repellent.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a single dose of garlic orally does not seem to effectively repel mosquitos (51322). The effect of long-term garlic administration is unclear.\nless\nMultiple myeloma. It is unclear if oral garlic prevents multiple myeloma.\nA case-control study comparing a small population of adults with and without multiple myeloma has found that increased intake of garlic in the diet may be associated with a decreased risk of developing multiple myeloma (51476).\nless\nMuscle strength. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for muscle strength.\nPopulation research has found that increased consumption of raw garlic is associated with increased hand grip strength in healthy adults. Females consuming raw garlic 2-3 times per week were 23% less likely to have low handgrip strength, defined as being below the 20th percentile, when compared to those who almost never eat garlic. In males, the odds of having low handgrip strength were 34% lower. Eating any raw garlic, even less than once per week, was associated with an increased likelihood for having high grip strength (102678).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for obesity.\nClinical research shows that taking garlic powder (Amin Pharmaceutical Company) 1600 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight or body mass index when compared with placebo in overweight or obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although there is a small effect on waist circumference (102681). One small clinical study evaluating garlic in combination with multiple other ingredients shows that the combination (Prograde Metabolism) modestly improves body weight, fat mass, and waist and hip circumference when compared with placebo. The other ingredients include raspberry ketone, caffeine, capsicum extract, ginger root extract, bitter orange fruit, L-theanine, and black pepper fruit (40802). However, it is unclear if this benefit is due to garlic, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOnychomycosis. Although there has been interest in using topical garlic for onychomycosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nOropharyngeal candidiasis. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for oropharyngeal candidiasis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with oral candidiasis shows that applying a topical garlic paste four times daily for 14 days to affected areas can increase the rate of complete eradication of oral lesions by 23% when compared with clotrimazole solution (51330).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for osteoarthritis.\nPreliminary clinical research in overweight and obese females with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking garlic tablets (Nature Made) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces pain scores by an additional 15% when compared with placebo (98813).\nless\nOtitis media. Although there has been interest in using topical garlic for otitis media, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). Oral garlic seems to improve pain-free walking distance by a small amount in patients with PAD. However, it does not seem to improve blood pressure.\nIn patients with stage II peripheral arterial occlusive disease, a small clinical trial shows that taking garlic (Kwai) 400 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves pain-free walking distance by about 15 meters. There was no effect on blood pressure or ankle or brachial pressures (4801).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for PCOS.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with PCOS shows that taking garlic orally 800 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by approximately 8% when compared with placebo. Taking garlic did not affect other cholesterol levels; however, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Garlic supplementation also modestly reduces body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in this population. However, there was no change in hip circumference (107238, 111763).\nless\nPre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral garlic prevents pre-eclampsia during the third trimester.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific garlic extract (Garlet, Cosar Pharmaceutical Company) 800 mg daily during the third trimester of pregnancy does not reduce the risk of developing pre-eclampsia in high-risk patients with first-time pregnancies (9201, 51626).\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for PMS.\nPreliminary clinical research in adult students with moderate to severe PMS shows that taking a specific garlic supplement (Allium-S, Dineh Pharmaceutical Company) orally 400 mg daily, standardized to contain 1.1 mg allicin, for 3 menstrual cycles improves PMS symptom scores 1.4 times more than placebo. After taking garlic for 3 cycles, 91% of students improved to mild PMS, compared with only 36% in the placebo group (107239).\nless\nProstate cancer. Observational research on the relationship between garlic intake and prostate cancer risk is conflicting. It is unclear if garlic supplements are beneficial in patients with prostate cancer.\nObservational research in Chinese males shows that those who eat garlic 2.14 grams/day (about one clove) seem to have a 50% lower risk of developing prostate cancer (9876). Also, a pooled analysis of epidemiological research suggests that garlic consumption may be associated with a 23% decreased odds of developing prostate cancer (88410). A case-control study has also found that garlic, consumed at least twice weekly, may reduce the risk for prostate cancer when compared with lower consumption (4777). However, other population research suggests that garlic consumption has no effect on prostate cancer risk in Iranian males (51454).\n\nOne very small clinical study in patients with prostate cancer shows that taking garlic extract 1 mg/kg daily for one month might improve prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, urinary flow, and urinary frequency when compared with baseline (10374). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral garlic seems to reduce pain by a small amount in patients with RA.\nClinical research in females with RA shows that taking dried garlic (Garcin; Goldaru Co.) 500 mg twice daily, providing allicin 5 mg, for 8 weeks reduces pain after activity and improves functional ability by a small amount when compared with placebo. Fatigue and pain were reduced by approximately 13% and tender joint count was reduced by 47% (102680, 103481). The long-term effect of garlic supplementation is unclear.\nless\nScleroderma. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial for scleroderma.\nClinical research shows that taking garlic 900 mg daily for 7 days does not have an effect on vasomotor function when compared with placebo in females with scleroderma (51374).\nless\nStress. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for stress, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nTick repellent. It is unclear if oral garlic is beneficial as a tick repellent.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking garlic 1200 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces the number of tick bites when compared with placebo (3318). However, the effect of garlic when compared with commercially available tick repellents is unknown (8027).\nless\nTinea capitis. Although there has been interest in using topical garlic for tinea capitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nTinea corporis. It is unclear if topical garlic is beneficial for tinea corporis.\nApplying a gel containing 0.6% ajoene, a constituent of garlic, twice daily for one week seems to be as effective as terbinafine 1% cream for tinea corporis (4767).\nless\nTinea cruris. It is unclear if topical garlic is beneficial for tinea cruris.\nApplying a gel containing 0.6% ajoene, a constituent of garlic, twice daily for one week seems to be as effective as terbinafine 1% cream for tinea cruris (4767).\nless\nTinea pedis. It is unclear if topical garlic is beneficial for tinea pedis.\nApplying a gel containing 1% ajoene, a constituent of garlic, twice daily seems to be more effective than 0.6% ajoene gel, and seems to be as effective as 1% terbinafine (Lamisil) for tinea pedis infections. Sixty days after completing one week of treatment, mycological cure occurred in 100% of patients using 1% ajoene, 72% of patients using 0.6% ajoene , and 94% of those using 1% terbinafine (8019). Additional research suggests that 0.4% ajoene gel twice daily has a 7-day cure rate of around 80% (4766).\nless\nTrichomoniasis. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for trichomoniasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nTuberculosis. Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for tuberculosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nUnstable angina. It is unclear if intravenous garlic is beneficial for unstable angina.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with unstable angina shows that giving garlicin, 60 mg by intravenous infusion daily for 10 days improves symptoms by 7% when compared with intravenous nitroglycerin (51244).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). Although there has been interest in using oral garlic for UTIs, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of garlic for this condition.\nVaginal candidiasis. It is unclear if oral or topical garlic is beneficial for vaginal candidiasis.\nOne small clinical study in asymptomatic patients with culture-positive candida infections shows that taking garlic (Garlicin, Nature's Way) 1050 mg (3 tablets) twice daily for 14 days does not improve vaginal symptoms, candida colony counts, or cases of vaginal candidiasis when compared with placebo (88405). Another small clinical study shows that application of a vaginal cream containing garlic and thyme nightly for 7 nights is as effective as clotrimazole vaginal cream for treating vaginal candidiasis (88387). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to garlic, thyme, or the combination.\nless\nWarts. It is unclear if topical garlic is beneficial for warts.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific lipid-soluble garlic extract topically to warts on the hands twice daily results in wart resolution within 1-2 weeks. An aqueous garlic extract applied twice daily also seems to provide modest improvement, but only after 30-40 days of treatment (15030). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if topical garlic is beneficial for wound healing.\nBased on patient and physician evaluations, preliminary clinical research shows that applying an ointment containing fresh garlic in petroleum jelly twice daily for 2 weeks results in 80% of surgical wounds healing at a faster rate than those treated with petroleum jelly. Most patients also indicated that the wound treated with garlic experienced less discomfort (102676).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate garlic for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGarlic has most often been used in doses of 2400 mg daily for 12 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nGarlic extract is often standardized to allicin content, with concentrations in most formulations ranging from 1.1% to 1.3% (731, 4782, 4786, 4788, 4789, 4795, 4796, 4798, 6457, 6897)(51250, 51343, 51590, 51598, 107239).\nTopical:\nGarlic has been used in various topical formulations, including as a cream, gel, paste, ointment, and mouthwash. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nIntravenous:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nMany garlic products, including garlic powder, garlic oil, and garlic extract, are standardized to allicin content. Tablets containing enteric-coated Australian garlic powder have been standardized to provide 2.4 mg allicin per 220 mg garlic powder (51250). A specific garlic powder tablet (Garlet) has been standardized to contain allicin 1000-1200 mcg per 400 mg of dried powder garlic (9201, 51467). Some specific garlic powder products, including Kwai (Lichtwer Pharma) and Garlex (Bosch Pharmaceuticals), have been standardized to contain 1.3% allicin (731, 4782, 4786, 4788, 4789, 4795, 4796, 4798, 6457, 6897)(51343, 51590, 51598).\n\nGarlic oil has also been standardized to allicin content. In clinical research, garlic oil 275 mg was standardized to contain 800 mcg allicin (4763). A specific product containing steam-distilled garlic oil (Tegra, Hermes Arzneimittel GmbH) 5 mg (equivalent to 4-5 grams of fresh garlic cloves) has been standardized to contain 4000 units of allicin (732).\n\nSome garlic extract products have also been standardized to allicin content. Tablets containing enteric-coated Thai garlic extract have been standardized to contain 1.12% allicin (15296).\n\nGarlic is also available as aged garlic extract, which refers to extracts produced from aged garlic bulbs soaked in water or ethanol. Alternatively, black garlic (also referred to as aged black garlic) is produced by exposing fresh garlic bulbs to high temperatures and controlled humidity for several weeks to months. These aging processes are associated with biochemical changes, including the decomposition of alliin and allicin, which leads to the production of S-allyl-L-cysteine and an increase in polysulfides (i.e., diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, dithiins, and ajoene). Aged garlic and black garlic extracts differ in amounts of furfurals and organosulfur compounds (108607).\n\nA specific product containing aged garlic extract (Kyolic, Garlic High Potency Everyday Formula 112, Wakunaga/Wagner) 240 mg (equivalent to 625 mg of fresh garlic) has been standardized to contain 0.6 mg of S-allyl-L-cysteine (51442, 88398). One specific aged black garlic extract product (ABG+; PharmActive Biotech Products) prepared using a proprietary aging process has been standardized to contain a minimum of S-allyl-L-cysteine 0.1% (108607).",

While the exact cause of this interaction is unclear, there is speculation that garlic might decrease the intestinal absorption of atazanavir or increase its metabolism by inducing cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (88388). Until more is known, advise patients not to consume large amounts of garlic while taking atazanavir.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGarlic might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2E1.\nClinical research suggests garlic oil can inhibit the activity of CYP2E1 by 39% (10847).

This may increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.\nSome human research suggests that garlic may induce INTESTINAL CYP3A4, reducing levels of drugs metabolized by this enzyme. This is primarily based on a study showing that taking a specific allicin-containing garlic product (GarliPure Maximum Allicin Formula, Natrol Inc.) twice daily for 3 days reduces saquinavir levels by approximately 50%. It is speculated that the allicin constituent induced CYP3A4 in the gut mucosa (7027, 93578). Another study shows that giving docetaxel intravenously, bypassing the CYP3A4 enzymes in the gut mucosa, along with the same specific garlic product for 12 consecutive days, does not affect docetaxel levels (17221). Conversely, there is concern that garlic may inhibit HEPATIC CYP3A4. In a single case report, increased tacrolimus levels and liver injury occurred in a liver transplant patient after taking a specific garlic supplement (Garlicin Cardio, Nature's Way) at up to three times the manufacturer recommended dose for 7 days (96010). Several other studies have evaluated the impact of other garlic formulations on CYP3A4 substrates and have found no effect.

Garlic reduced the maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC), but not the half-life, of isoniazid. This suggests that garlic extract might inhibit isoniazid absorption across the intestinal mucosa (15031); however, the exact mechanism of this potential interaction is not known.\nless\nPROTEASE INHIBITORS (PIs)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, garlic products containing allicin might decrease levels of PIs.\nProtease inhibitors are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzymes. There is concern that garlic products containing allicin might induce intestinal CYP3A4, reducing plasma levels of protease inhibitors. This is primarily based on a study showing that taking a specific garlic product (GarliPure Maximum Allicin Formula, Natrol Inc.) twice daily for 3 days reduces levels of saquinavir, a PI, by approximately 50%. It is speculated that the allicin constituent induce CYP3A4 in the gut mucosa (7027, 93578). Several studies have evaluated the impact of other garlic formulations on CYP3A4 substrates and have found no effect.

There is concern that garlic products containing allicin might induce intestinal CYP3A4 and cause subtherapeutic levels of saquinavir. This is primarily based on a pharmacokinetic study showing that taking a specific garlic product (GarliPure Maximum Allicin Formula, Natrol Inc.) twice daily for 3 days reduces saquinavir levels by approximately 50%. It is speculated that the allicin constituent induces CYP3A4 in the gut mucosa (7027, 93578). Several pharmacokinetic studies have evaluated the impact of other garlic formulations on CYP3A4 substrates and have found no effect. Most of the products in these studies provided little or no allicin (10335, 10847, 15031, 94506).

In addition, there is a report of two patients who experienced an increase in a previously stabilized international normalized ratio (INR) with concomitant garlic and warfarin use (51228, 51631). However, this report has been subsequently debated due to limited clinical information. Other clinical studies have not identified an effect of garlic on INR, warfarin pharmacokinetics, or bleeding risk (15032, 16416).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of garlic is the bulb. The bulb of garlic contains the cysteine sulfoxide Many of the pharmacological effects of garlic are attributed to the allicin, ajoene, and other alliin, also known as S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (8017). When the garlic bulb is crushed, ground, or cut, the alliin constituent is converted to allicin (also known as diallylthiosulfinate) by the enzyme alliinase (3251, 4768, 8017). Fresh garlic contains approximately 1% alliin. One milligram of alliin is converted to 0.458 mg allicin (4800). The amount of allicin in garlic preparations is dependent upon the method of preparation. Processes that involve maceration of the garlic clove increase the activity of alliinase. Freeze-dried garlic may contain little or no allicin. The age of garlic affects the amount of alliin contained in the product. Garlic is aged to reduce the content of other sulfur compounds and the odor commonly associated with garlic. The process to produce odorless aged garlic extract reduces the alliin content to only 3% of what is typically contained in fresh garlic (4800).\n\nOther garlic constituents include S-propylcysteinesulfoxide (PCSO) and S-methylcysteine-sulfoxide (MCSO), which can also be converted by alliinase to constituents such as allyl methane thiosulfinate, methyl methanethiosulfinate, and other thiosulfinates. Volatile constituents of garlic include diallyldisulfide (DADS), dimethyltrisulfide (DATS), and sulfur dioxide (8017).\n\nGarlic extracts have been shown to contain constituents such as E-ajoene (8017). Aged garlic extracts may contain constituents such as S-allylcysteine (SAC) and S- allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC), while garlic oil may include constituents such as diallyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide (3234, 8017). Heat and steam distillation used to produce garlic oil from crushed garlic converts allicin to allyl sulfides which are thought to have biological activity (3251).\n\nTo improve effectiveness, garlic preparations may be enteric coated to protect the active constituents from degeneration by stomach acid (9203).\nAnthelmintic effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that minced garlic or aqueous extract of garlic can reduce Capillaria infestation in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (51492). The exact mechanism is unclear, and it is not clear if these effects are observable in humans.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nSome evidence in humans suggests that garlic inhibits inflammatory compounds, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and reduces levels of homocysteine (96007, 102675, 103480, 103481, 106613, 110721, 111765). The anti-inflammatory effects of garlic might play a role in its potential clinical benefits related to diseases such as arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Researchers theorize that phytocompounds in garlic including allicin, allyl, cysteine, and allyl disulphide have antioxidant properties which protect against oxidative stress (110721).\nAntibacterial effects\nFresh garlic has shown activity against Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella enteritidis; it has been suggested as a food additive to prevent food poisoning (4808). In addition to fresh garlic, crude garlic extract has also been shown to have antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, suggesting it may be beneficial for eliminating bacterial in the mouth known to cause dental caries (51391, 51400). Other in vitro research suggests that garlic extract may have antibacterial activity against several strains of mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, and Mycobacterium kansasii, three bacteria associated with pulmonary infections (51490, 51506, 51544, 51582). However, garlic extract does not seem to have additive effects when used in combination with antituberculosis drugs (51490). Garlic oil has also been shown to have antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (51582). The antibacterial activity of garlic oil has been attributed to its allyl sulfur compounds (51434). It has been suggested that garlic oil's antimicrobial activity is more potent than garlic powder on a unit weight basis (51227).\n\nThe antimicrobial effects of garlic have been attributed to its allicin content. Allicin is believed to inhibit RNA synthesis and reduce DNA and protein synthesis (51484). Allicin and other sulfur-containing constituents of garlic may also inhibit bacterial growth by interacting with and inactivating enzymes necessary for growth (51489). The garlic constituent ajoene also possesses antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and -negative bacterial species in vitro. The disulfide bond in ajoene may be responsible for these effects, but the exact mechanism of action is unclear (51567).\nAntidiabetic effects\nGarlic seems to lower blood glucose in people with or without diabetes (96004, 114890). Preliminary clinical research suggests some compounds in garlic, such as S-methylcysteine sulfoxide and S-allylcysteine sulfoxide, might have some antidiabetic activity (9875). In vitro evidence suggests that S-allyl cysteine sulfoxide stimulate insulin secretion from beta-cells (51557). Other in vitro evidence suggests that aged garlic extract can inhibit the formation of advanced glycation end products, which are associated with diabetic complication (51387).\nAntifungal effects\nThe garlic constituents allicin and ajoene are thought to be responsible for garlic's antifungal activity against tinea infections (8017, 8019). Aged garlic extract and its constituents ajoene and allitriduim have shown antifungal activity against Scedosporium prolificans, a fungal species that can affect immunocompromised patients (51273). Fresh garlic, aged garlic extract, and the garlic constituent allicin have shown antifungal activity against Candida albicans in the laboratory (4808, 51456, 51489). In humans, oral intake of garlic extract 25 mL was associated with anticandidal activity in serum for up to 1 hour after ingestion (51522). The antifungal activity of garlic against candida infections has been attributed to the ability of allicin to downregulate SIR2, a gene involved in with the formation of hyphae (51475). Garlic may also inhibit the synthesis of lipids by Candida albicans, resulting in cell leakage (51489, 51501).\nAntilipemic effects\nVarious clinical studies have shown that garlic can improve levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, oxidized LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (51463, 51465, 106613, 110721, 114890, 114891). There is some evidence that various garlic constituents may be potent inhibitors of hepatic cholesterol synthesis (8407, 51216, 51246, 51649). Garlic may also exert its antilipemic effect by stimulating the synthesis and secretion of apolipoproteins (110721). In patients with hyperlipidemia, garlic might lower cholesterol levels by acting as a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) (4810, 4811, 51646, 51647, 51648). Garlic may also reduce the activity of enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis, including hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, and squalene monooxygenase (51246, 51645), as well as enzymes that catalyze fatty acid synthesis such as fatty acid synthetase (51646). However, some laboratory evidence suggests that garlic might also inhibit or reduce the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (51646, 51647).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn various laboratory studies, garlic and its constituents displayed antioxidant activity, including increasing the activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase; lowering xanthine oxidase activity; and inhibiting lipid peroxidation and prostaglandin production (51207, 51241, 51256, 51268, 51270, 51287, 51298, 51309, 51311, 51325)(51337, 51342, 51348, 51362, 51363, 51381, 51407, 51410, 51423, 51433)(51575, 51592, 51637, 51638). Some laboratory evidence suggests that the antioxidant capacity of fresh garlic may be greater than that of dried garlic (40694). In humans, evidence regarding the effect of garlic on serum antioxidant capacity or markers of oxidation is mixed (51383, 102680, 111763, 111765). A meta-analysis of 12 randomized, controlled clinical trials shows that garlic increases the total antioxidant capacity of serum and the levels of superoxide dismutase, while decreasing serum malondialdehyde levels (105527). However, there was considerable heterogeneity, with garlic doses varying from 80-4000 mg daily, and duration varying from 2-24 weeks. Subjects included those who were healthy and those with various different disease states.\nAntiparasitic effects\nLaboratory evidence suggests that garlic oil has broad-spectrum activity against Trypanosoma, Plasmodium, Giardia, Leishmania, and Cochlospermum planchonii (51335, 96007). Animal research suggests that the garlic constituent allicin decreases infections and increases survival of mice exposed to Plasmodium, the parasitic protozoa that causes malaria (51368). In animals and in vitro, garlic extract augments Leishmania engulfment and destroys amastigotes by macrophages (51340, 51399). In vitro, the garlic constituent ajoene inhibits enzymes found in Trypanosoma (51589).\nAntiviral effects\nPreliminary in vitro evidence suggests that garlic compounds, including ajoene, allicin, allyl methyl thiosulfinate, and methyl allyl thiosulfinate, might have activity against viruses such as cytomegalovirus, influenza B, herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, parainfluenza virus type 3, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and human rhinovirus type 2 (4769, 51488, 51547, 51591, 96007).\nAthletic performance effects\nA single administration of dried garlic powder increased endurance performance in humans when compared with placebo. Theoretically, this could be due to increase in fibrinolytic activity in the resting state which may improve blood flow to the exercising muscle (51623). Taking a single dose of garlic extract with a carbohydrate rich meal immediately after 60 minutes of high intensity exercise enhanced skeletal muscle glycogen replenishment when compared with placebo plus a carbohydrate rich meal (113907).\nCardiovascular effects\nHuman research shows that high-dose garlic powder for up to 4 years reduces arteriosclerotic and age-dependent plaque volume in both carotid and femoral arteries (4798). For age-related vascular changes and atherosclerosis, garlic is thought to be beneficial and protect vascular endothelial cells from injury by reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, and through antithrombotic effects (1871, 1876, 1880, 4813, 8017, 8408, 51264, 51545, 51650). There is evidence that LDL oxidation may be inhibited by the organosulfur constituents of garlic, including S-allyl cysteine, S-allyl mercaptocysteine, alliin, allixin, N-acetyl-S-allyl cysteine, and diallyl disulfide (DADS) (8408, 51583). However, this hypothesis has been in dispute based on a six-month trial in moderately hypercholesterolemic volunteers, which failed to demonstrate any effects of garlic supplementation on lipoprotein oxidation (51211). Also, garlic does not seem to reduce levels of lipoprotein (a), a lipoprotein similar to LDL, in human plasma (96009).\n\nIn addition to inhibiting LDL oxidation, laboratory research suggests that garlic constituents, including diallyl sulfide (DAS) and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), suppress oxidized LDL-induced expression of E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, thereby decreasing monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells which occurs at early stages of atherosclerosis (51409). Aged garlic extract does not appear to affect the expression of adhesion molecules nor the adherence of leukocytes on the surface of endothelium, although it does appear to reduce the development of fatty streak formation and cholesterol accumulation in the vessel wall of animals fed high cholesterol diets, suggesting an alternative method for protection against the onset of atherosclerosis (1879, 51234). Similarly, in vitro and ex vivo evidence suggests that garlic powder extract may reduce lipid accumulation in atherosclerotic human aortic cells by inhibiting acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity and stimulating cholesteryl ester hydrolase (51535, 51651). Some evidence in humans suggests that garlic inhibits inflammatory compounds, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and inflammatory cytokines. An increased level of these compounds is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (96007, 102675, 103480, 103481, 110721).\nChemoprotective/antitumor effects\nGarlic contains a number of sulfur compounds thought to produce anticancer effects, including S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC), diallyl disulfide (DADS), diallyl trisulfide (DATS) and allicin (108604). Allicin, the major constituent of garlic, plays a key role in antiproliferative effects and causes depletion in intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels (51251). The garlic constituents S-allyl cysteine (SAC) and SAMC have been shown to have radical scavenging activity. SAMC has also been shown to have activity against erythroleukemic cancer cells, breast cancer cells, and prostate cancer cells (1871, 1877, 1878, 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882). Diallyl sulfide and DADS inhibited arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity and 2-aminofluorene-DNA adduct in human promyelocytic leukemia cells (51263). DADS also caused caspase-3-dependent apoptosis via a Bax-triggered mitochondria pathway, activating caspase-3 and caspase-9, and causing Bax translocation and cytochrome c release (51425). In vitro research shows that DADS can inhibit the expression of cyclin B1, cdc2, and cdc25c proteins, leading to arrest in tumor cells (108604). The constituent ajoene has been observed to induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells (8017).\n\nAnimal studies have reported protective effects of garlic against hepatotoxins (51247, 51286, 51502, 51555) and chemotherapy-induced toxicity from cyclophosphamide (51338, 51413, 51480), doxorubicin (51220, 51296, 51433), methylcholanthrene (51479), gentamicin (51224), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (51248), methotrexate (51365), and bromobenzene (1883, 51586).\n\nIn human research, aged garlic extract suppressed both the size and number of colon adenomas in patients (51359). Also, preliminary evidence suggests that garlic and aged garlic extract may have pharmacological effects that are similar to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine in the treatment of bladder cancer (8018). There is some evidence that the chemical constituents containing allyl groups may be responsible for chemoprotective properties (51496). The chemopreventive potential of garlic may be due to its antioxidant activity and modulation of lipid peroxidation (51408, 51575, 51637, 51638, 51654). In animal research, compounds in garlic have been found to modulate the activity of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes that activate or detoxify carcinogens (51326). Garlic has demonstrated strong inhibition of cancer development in the presence of known tumor promoters, including 12-O-tetradecanoylpharbol-13-acetate (51302, 51485), 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (51280), and phorbol-myristate-acetate (51523), as well as tumor inducers such as 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (51302) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (51504, 51566). Other potential chemopreventive mechanisms of garlic include modulating the activity of several metabolizing enzymes that detoxify carcinogens and inhibit DNA adduct formation, antioxidative and free radical-scavenging properties, and regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses (8017, 51432, 108604). Additionally, garlic might enhance selenium absorption and protect against tumorigenesis (4815).\n\nGarlic also seems to have humoral and cellular immunostimulant activity. Research has provided evidence of the antiproliferative effects of garlic on human cancer cell lines (51237, 51251), including induction of apoptosis (51259, 51262, 51267, 51277, 51291, 51379, 51405, 51415, 51581, 51655, 108604), regulation of cell cycle progression (51260, 108604), and signal transduction modification (108604). Both cellular proliferation (51238, 51405, 51548, 51656) and immune function appear to be affected (51235, 51657). In animal research evaluating the effects on tumor marker enzymes, garlic elevated the activity of gamma-glutamate transpeptidase (GGT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT), and reduced the activity of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) (51640). There is also evidence suggesting that garlic and aged garlic extract might stimulate T-cell proliferation; restore suppressed antibody responses; stimulate macrophage cytotoxicity and phagocytosis of tumor cells; and induce the release of interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and gamma interferon (8018).\nCirculatory effects\nIn observational research, garlic supplementation increased calf blood flow in healthy individuals. The improvement was associated with and possibly mediated by increased plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6). In this study, increased IL-6 was independent of the activation of the NO pathway (51299). In human research, garlic reduced blood viscosity, which may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cerebral vascular accidents (51394).\nCoagulation effects\nGarlic powder and aged garlic preparations have been shown to have antiplatelet properties in both patients with cardiovascular disease and in healthy volunteers (1874, 3234, 4366, 4801, 4802, 4803). Garlic has been found to have antithrombotic properties and can increase fibrinolytic activity, decrease platelet aggregation and adhesion, increase the prothrombin time (PT), and inhibit metabolic enzymes in platelets responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins and other products (3234, 4366, 4799, 8017, 12423, 51255, 51494, 51574, 51641, 51658) (96013). Raw garlic appears to dose-dependently inhibit platelet cyclooxygenase and reduce serum thromboxane B2 (9874, 51531, 51562, 51569, 51572). Antiplatelet activity may be attributable to garlic constituents, including adenosine, ajoene, allicin, and paraffinic polysulfides (51452, 51500). Raw garlic seems to have more potent antiplatelet properties than cooked garlic (4799, 4804, 15297, 51562, 51563). Crushing garlic before cooking might prevent some of the loss of antiplatelet activity (15297). Garlic oil does not appear to affect platelet aggregation (4805).\nCytochrome P450 effects\nThere is some evidence that garlic might affect the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system. In vitro evidence suggests that garlic might inhibit several CYP450 enzymes including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 (12198). But clinical research suggests garlic oil does not affect CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 (10847).\n\nOther findings indicate that garlic might mildly inhibit CYP2D6 activity by about 9% in humans (1303). This limited inhibition is not likely to produce clinically significant increases in drugs that are metabolized by the CYP2D6 isoenzyme. However, some researchers suspect that garlic supplements that contain a significant amount of allicin can induce the CYP3A4 isoenzyme and can produce clinical significant decreases in levels of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (7027). However, in a small study, taking a specific garlic product (GarliPure Maximum Allicin Formula, Natrolm Chatsworth) 600 mg twice daily providing 3,600 mcg allicin per dose, for 12 consecutive days did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, a CYP3A4 substrate (17221).\n\nA garlic extract, containing alliin and alliinase, does not affect the activity of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 (10335). Clinical research suggests that garlic oil might inhibit CYP2E1 activity by 39% (10847). The ability of garlic to induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes may depend upon the presence of other constituents in the preparation that is being used.\nDermatologic effects\nGarlic has been shown to treat warts and corns in human research; however, the mechanism is unclear but may be related to antiviral and enhanced immunologic effects (15030). Garlic reportedly reduced cellular proliferation in viral effected cells and exerted anti-DNA activity (15030). Garlic's fibrinolytic effect may cause the surrounding fibrin tissue around the corn capsule to lyse and separate from the tissue (15030).\nGastroprotective effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that garlic extract and commercial garlic tablets have antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori, a common bacterial associated with stomach infections or peptic ulcer (51208, 51242). The anti-Helicobacter pylori effects of garlic seem to be highest for the garlic constituent allicin, followed by undiluted garlic oil then garlic powder (3322). The antibacterial effect of garlic products against H. pylori appears to be dependent on the content of allicin (51208). For garlic constituents, antimicrobial activity appears to increase with the number of sulfur atoms contained in the constituent (3322).\n\nEarly evidence suggests a possible protective effect of aged garlic on intestinal toxicity induced by methotrexate (MTX) and fluorouracil (5FU) (1885, 9208). Preliminary evidence suggests that garlic might interfere with the oral absorption of lead; the sulfur containing amino acids might chelate lead in the gastrointestinal tract (9202). Samgyetang, a soup made from chicken, jujube, Panax ginseng, garlic, and chestnuts, appears to offer protection from experimentally induced peptic ulcers (10249).\nGenitourinary effects\nChronic garlic ingestion for 70 days has been associated with suppression of spermatogenesis in rats (51526).\nHepatoprotective effects\nThere is some preliminary evidence of hepatoprotective effects of garlic. In humans, garlic supplementation reduces levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), but not alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (102679). In vitro, aged garlic extract has been shown to have hepatoprotective effects (1883). According to laboratory studies, S-allyl cysteine and S-allyl mercaptocysteine might protect the liver against acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride, possibly by reducing oxidative stress (9873). Other preliminary evidence suggests S-allyl cysteine might ameliorate doxorubicin-induced cardiac and hepatic toxicity (4780). Researchers of a meta-analysis on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) theorize that garlic activates antioxidant pathways, preventing hepatocyte cell degradation and liver enzyme release into the bloodstream. Another possible mechanism is through the anti-inflammatory active ingredient in garlic S-allyl cysteine preventing inflammatory cytokine production and consequently affecting liver enzyme production (110720).\nImmunologic effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that garlic oil 100-200 mg/kg every other day for 2 weeks enhances lymphocyte proliferation rate and increase the production of the cytokines interleukin 2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-4, and IL-10 upon stimulation with concanavalin A (51421). At low doses, garlic oil appears to enhance T cell response toward the Th1 type cytokines (e.g., IL-2 and INF-gamma) (51421). These cytokines have been associated with beneficial antitumor response (8018). At high doses, garlic oil appears to enhance Th2-type cytokines (eg, IL-4 and IL-10) at high doses (51421). Other animal research suggests that aqueous garlic solution 600 mg/kg/4 mL daily for one month decreases INF-gamma production and increases IL-4 production in phytohemagglutinin-activated rat spleen lymphocytes, suggesting that garlic may favor a humor immune response when administered at higher doses (51420).\n\nSome in vitro evidence suggests that garlic powder extract reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced production of IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in human whole blood. Garlic powder extract also appears to reduce the activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kB, a transcription factor involved in inflammation associated with autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as atherosclerosis (51282).\n\nGarlic may also enhanced natural killer (NK) cell number and activity against tumor cell lines (51285, 51358). However, while raw garlic juice, heated garlic juice, dehydrated garlic powder, and aged garlic extract all seem to increase NK cell activities in tumor-bearing mice, only aged garlic extract and heated garlic juice appear to inhibit the growth of tumor cells (51240).\n\nGarlic also appears to stimulate macrophage and lymphocyte proliferation, which may protect the body against immunity suppression induced by chemotherapy or radiation treatments (8018). Animal research also suggests that long-term administration of garlic may improve age-associated decline in immune function (1882). The garlic constituent alliin appears to increase the phagocytic function of peripheral blood leukocytes and monocytes (51212).\nNeurologic effects\nIn animal research, aged garlic extract prevented deterioration of hippocampal-based memory tasks (51389) and had antiamyloidogenic effects (51372). In vitro, S-allyl-L-cysteine protected against amyloid beta- and tunicamycin-induced neuronal death (51294). The protein TRPA1 mediates the response to pungent irritants found in garlic, and is found mainly in nociceptive neurons of peripheral ganglia and in all the mechanosensory epithelia of the inner ear (51382). In an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis transgenic mouse model, diallyl trisulfide (DATS) demonstrated neuroprotective effects (51453). DATS has activated phase II enzymes. SOD1-G93A transgenic mice were administered DATS orally (80 mg/kg daily). DATS extended disease duration and life span for around one week, induced HO-1, and decreased GFAP expression.\nOcular effects\nIn animal research, S-allylmercaptocysteine, a garlic-derived compound, reduced intraocular pressure; it may involve the elevation of ANP levels (51206).\nRadioprotective effects\nIn vivo, the garlic-derived organosulfur constituent allylmethylsulfide has demonstrated radioprotective effects, possibly by downregulating the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-signaling pathway (51431).\nSkeletal effects\nIn animal research, garlic suppressed bone loss due to estrogen deficiency (51347). In ovariectomized rats, garlic may inhibit bone resorption, as evidenced by alterations of serum alkaline phosphatase activity; serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity; urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxyproline; and the urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratio (51310). In animal research, garlic prevented bone mineral loss by promoting intestinal transference of calcium through the partial revival of the serum estrogen titer (51367).\nVascular effects\nVasorelaxant properties of garlic have been noted in multiple preclinical studies (51271, 51293, 51297). Cutaneous microcirculation has been shown to increase in humans following ingestion of 600 mg of garlic due to vasodilation of precapillary arterioles (51222, 51424). In patients with hypertension, garlic is thought to reduce blood pressure by causing smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation by activating production of endothelium-derived relaxation factor (EDRF, nitric oxide) (4812, 51533, 51661). It has been suggested that allicin is the component of garlic responsible for nitric oxide-mediated effects (51662). Garlic may also attenuate age-related increases in aortic stiffness, which may improve vasoelasticity and protect against cardiovascular diseases (4797).\nWeight loss effects\nIn animal research, the allyl-containing polysulfides in garlic have been found to be responsible for increasing thermogenesis (51205). These compounds enhance thermogenesis by increasing noradrenaline secretion via beta-adrenergic stimulation, enhance noradrenaline and adrenaline excretion, and reduce body fat accumulation by increasing triglyceride catabolism by the elevation of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and increasing uncoupling protein (UCP) (51205).\nWound healing effects\nIn animal research, wound-healing effects were attributed to angiogenic properties of aged garlic solution (51427). The exact mechanism is not well understood."

    "Gelatin": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Gelatin is a protein substance produced by hydrolysis of animal collagen, usually from the bones and skin of cows and pigs. Gelatin is used in the manufacturing of capsules, cosmetics, ointments, and suppositories. It is also used in the production of some foods, including jellied meats and marshmallows (92741, 92743, 97634). In traditional Chinese medicine, donkey-hide gelatin is used for various uses including gynecological conditions, anemia of chronic disease, cancer, and immune stimulation (97634, 106850, 107011).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Gelatin has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, short-term . A specific type of gelatin from donkey hide, called colla corii asini, has been safely used in doses of 6-10 grams orally daily for 6-8 weeks. Higher doses of 15 grams daily have been associated with an increased risk of inflammatory adverse effects, including sore throat, swollen gums, local eczema, and oral ulcers (97634, 107011).\nSince gelatin is often derived from bovine bones and skin, there is some concern about contamination with diseased animal parts (1825). So far, there are no reports of disease transmission to humans due to use of contaminated gelatin preparations.\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when gelatin tannate is used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, short-term. In children under 15 kg or under 3 years of age, gelatin tannate has been used with apparent safety at doses up to 250 mg four times daily for up to 5 days.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGelatin is a purified protein substance formed by hydrolysis of collagen obtained from the bones and hides of pigs and cows (7704). Depending on the source of collagen used to produce gelatin, the sequence and variety of amino acids will differ. In most cases, however, the predominant amino acids in gelatin include glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, alanine, glutamic acid, arginine, and aspartic acid. Glycine makes up around 25% to 30% of gelatin's amino acid content. This is because gelatin consists of repeating three amino acid sequences starting with glycine. The other two amino acids are often proline and hydroxyproline (92742, 92743).\nAntioxidant effects\nThere is preliminary research in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis that suggests gelatin in combination with the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) might suppress joint inflammation. Oxygen radicals are thought to play a role in the joint damage caused by rheumatoid arthritis (7707).\nBone effects\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that gelatin might inhibit bone collagen breakdown in people with osteoporosis (7704). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking vitamin C-enriched gelatin increases collagen synthesis, suggesting that it might be useful for improving bone, ligament, skin, and tendon health (101613).\nHematopoietic effects\nDonkey-hide gelatin is of interest for certain types of blood disorders. In an animal model, this type of gelatin has promoted the recovery of hematopoietic function. In human research, its use increased red blood cell count and hematocrit (107011)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGenistein combined polysaccharide is a soy-based product. It consists of a mixture of genistein, a soy isoflavone, and polysaccharide from the basidiomycetes, a variety of mushrooms. It is prepared by fermenting a soy extract with basidiomycetes mushrooms. Both the genistein and polysaccharide components are thought to have pharmacological activity (12110). The fermentation process deglycosylates existing soy isoflavones in addition to forming novel isoflavones specific to this process (12110).\nAnti-cancer effects\nGenistein has antiproliferative effects against hormone-dependent cancers such as breast cancer and prostate cancer (3983). This appears to be related to the hormonal effects of genistein, as well as to antioxidant and antiangiogenic effects (3983). Additionally, genistein combined polysaccharide seems to inhibit breast cancer tumor proliferation by inducing apoptosis (12197). Genistein and other isoflavones also inhibit the proliferation of bladder cells in laboratory research (95165). Genistein is also an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (12110). The polysaccharides from basidiomycetes are thought to have antitumor and immune modulating effects which could also play a role in the anti-cancer effects of genistein combined polysaccharide (12110).\n\nSome case reports have provided anecdotal evidence for benefit in bladder cancer and prostate cancer. In two patients taking genistein combined polysaccharide 5 grams daily for 12 months, there was no cytological recurrence of bladder cancer (95165). In one patient with prostate cancer, taking genistein combined polysaccharide was associated with a reduction in prostate size and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels (12110).\nAntimicrobial effects\nPolysaccharides from basidiomycetes are thought to have antibacterial effects (12110).\nAntiviral effects\nPolysaccharides from basidiomycetes are thought to have antiviral effects (12110).\nHormonal effects\nGenistein is a phytoestrogen. It binds to beta-estrogen receptor more strongly than alpha-estrogen receptor. The beta-estrogen receptor predominates in the heart, vasculature, bone, and bladder. This might account for some of the beneficial effects attributed to phytoestrogens (3983). Also, genistein seems to decrease expression of aromatase and 5-alpha reductase (12110). Some researchers suspect this might give genistein antiproliferative effects against hormone-dependent cancers such as breast cancer and prostate cancer (3983)."

Gentian has a yellow flower which contains mainly lutein, and other carotenoids such as beta-carotene, antheraxanthin, alpha and beta-cryptoxanthin (91896).\nAnalgesic effects\nTraditionally, gentian is used for its analgesic effects. Gentiopicroside, a compound in gentian, and the methanol extract of gentian, have been shown to possess analgesic properties in mice (51702, 51710).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nTraditionally, gentian is used for its anti-inflammatory effects. Gentian's anti-inflammatory effects can also be attributed to its antioxidant effects, as shown in vitro (51705, 51709).\nAppetite suppressant effects\nThe bitter taste of gentian root is due to its constituent secoiridoid monoterpene compounds. Studies conducted in mice show that bitter compounds, including those in gentian root, increase the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from duodenal cells, possibly exerting anorexiant effects and delaying gastric emptying (96534).\nCardiovascular effects\nGentian root has been used historically as an antihypertensive. Gentian root extracts seem to have vasorelaxant properties (13439, 13441). Preliminary research suggests that the xanthone constituents gentiacaulein and gentiakochianin may be responsible for vasodilation by an unknown mechanism (13440). Further preliminary research suggests that gentian root extract and its constituent isovitexin can decrease cholesterol in the blood, decrease medial aortic thickness, and decrease smooth muscle proliferation. This suggests that gentian may help prevent atherosclerosis (91894, 91895).\nSedative effects\nPreliminary research suggests that gentian root exhibits sedative effects. Additionally, the xanthone gentiacaulein seems to have antidepressant activity, possibly through inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A (13437, 51708, 51711). Preliminary research suggests that gentian bark extracts might also have MAO-B inhibitor effects (13438)."

It is unclear if inhaled German chamomile essential oil, as aromatherapy, is beneficial in patients with anxiety.\nA large clinical study in adults in Iran hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome shows that placing 7 drops of German chamomile essential oil 10% on a cotton ball and inhaling for 12 hours nightly for 2 nights modestly lowers anxiety scores when compared with a control group (114528). The validity of this finding is limited by the potential for inadequate blinding and the short study duration. However, a small clinical study in adults with gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine, and skin cancers receiving intravenous infusion therapy shows that inhaling German chamomile essential oil 3 times daily for 7 days does not reduce self-reported anxiety when compared with a control group (111379).\n\nGerman chamomile has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. A small, open-label study in critically ill children in the pediatric intensive care unit shows that aromatherapy massage with an essential oil 1% blend of lavender, German chamomile, and neroli in grapeseed oil reduces distress, anxiety, and heart rate when compared to baseline (111378). However, the validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding and control group. It is unclear if these effects are due to German chamomile, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if topical German chamomile is beneficial in patients with atopic dermatitis.\nClinical research in patients with atopic dermatitis shows that applying a specific cream containing a 2% ethanolic extract of German chamomile flowers (Kamillosan, Asta Medica AG) up to three times daily for up to 4 weeks improves pruritus, erythema, and desquamation when compared with placebo or hydrocortisone 0.5% cream (19707).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there has been interest in using oral German chamomile for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of German chamomile for this purpose.\nBurning mouth syndrome. German chamomile has only been evaluated as a mouthwash in combination with flaxseed; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in female patients with burning mouth syndrome shows that using a mouthwash containing German chamomile and flaxseed 3-4 times daily for 3 months decreases subjective burning and dry mouth symptoms, increases salivary flow rate, and decreases saliva viscosity when compared with baseline (104807). However, the validity of these results is limited by the lack of a control group and product standardization, as the mouthwash was prepared by each patient from ingredients they purchased.\nless\nCancer-related anorexia. It is unclear if inhaled German chamomile essential oil, as aromatherapy, is beneficial in patients with cancer-related anorexia.\nA small clinical study in adults with gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine, and skin cancers receiving intravenous infusion therapy shows that inhaling German chamomile essential oil 3 times daily for 7 days does not increase self-reported appetite when compared with a control group (111379).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if inhaled German chamomile essential oil, as aromatherapy, is beneficial in patients with CINV.\nA small clinical study in adults treated for gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine, and skin cancers with intravenous infusion therapy shows that inhaling German chamomile essential oil 3 times daily for 7 days does not improve self-reported nausea when compared with a control group. (111379).\nless\nColic. Oral German chamomile has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical studies in infants with colic show that two multi-ingredient products given orally twice daily for 1-4 weeks reduce crying times when compared with placebo or simethicone 60 mg twice daily. The products studied contained German chamomile 178 mg with fennel and lemon balm (ColiMil, Milte Italia SPA) and German chamomile 9 mg with lemon balm and Lactobacillus acidophilus (ColiMil Plus, Milte Italia SPA) (16735, 96278). Other clinical research in infants shows that taking 150 mL of a specific herbal tea preparation (Calma-Bebi, Bonomelli) containing extracts of German chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel, and lemon balm up to three times daily after each episode of colic for 7 days increases the percentage of infants with relief by 31% when compared with placebo, although there was no effect on the number of night awakenings (19715).\nless\nCommon cold. It is unclear if inhaling the steam from a solution of German chamomile in hot water is beneficial in patients with a common cold.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that inhaling the steam from a solution containing 13-39 mL of German chamomile alcoholic extract (Kneipp Kamillen-Konzentrat, Kneipp Werke) dissolved in 1000 mL of hot water for 10 minutes reduces symptoms when compared to baseline in patients suffering from an uncomplicated common cold (19360).\nless\nDiarrhea. Oral German chamomile has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn children aged 6 months to 6 years with acute diarrhea, using a specific combination product (Diarrhoesan, Dr. Loges + Co. GmbH) containing apple pectin and German chamomile extract for 1-3 days reduces stool frequency and improves symptom relief when compared with placebo (19705).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral German chamomile for dysmenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of German chamomile for this purpose.\nDyspepsia. Oral German chamomile has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nTwo specific combination products containing German chamomile (Iberogast, Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH; STW-5-S, Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH), 1 mL three times daily for 4 weeks, seem to improve symptoms of dyspepsia. The combinations include German chamomile plus milk thistle, peppermint leaf, licorice, caraway, celandine, angelica, and lemon balm, with (Iberogast) or without (STW-5-S) clown's mustard plant (19532). A meta-analysis of studies using Iberogast product suggests that taking 1 mL orally three times daily for 4 weeks reduces severity of acid reflux, epigastric pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting when compared with placebo (13089). Also, using a preparation containing clown's mustard plant, German chamomile, peppermint, caraway, licorice, and lemon balm (STW 5-II, Steigerwald Arzneimittelwerk GmbH), 1 mL three times daily for up to 12 weeks, improves symptoms in 40% more patients than placebo (12724).\nless\nFibromyalgia. Although there has been interest in using oral German chamomile for fibromyalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of German chamomile for this purpose.\nFlatulence. It is unclear if oral German chamomile is beneficial in adults with flatulence post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy conducted in Iran shows that German chamomile extract 20 drops given once orally 1 hour before surgery mitigates the severity and incidence of flatulence 2 hours postoperatively when compared with placebo (112364). The interpretation of these findings is limited by the use of self-reported outcomes. In addition, providers had influence on who received German chamomile, raising concerns about selection bias.\nless\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is unclear if oral German chamomile is beneficial in adults with GAD.\nSmall clinical studies in adults with GAD show that taking German chamomile extract 220-1500 mg daily for 8-26 weeks improves anxiety rating scores but does not reduce the risk of relapse when compared with placebo (19377, 111380). Clinical practice guidelines from the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments do not currently recommend German chamomile as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in patients with GAD (110318).\nless\nGingivitis. Topical German chamomile has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in people with gingivitis shows that using a toothpaste containing German chamomile, sage, myrrh, eucalyptus, calcium carbonate, and sodium monofluorophosphate twice daily for 30 days reduces gingivitis scores when compared with baseline, but not when compared with standard toothpaste (19702).\nless\nHemorrhoids. Topical German chamomile might improve symptoms after anal surgery for hemorrhoids.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hemorrhoids shows that German chamomile ointment (Kamillosan, Asta Medica AG) applied twice daily for 6 weeks, in combination with band ligation plus anal dilation surgery, improves anal bleeding, itching, burning, and oozing when compared with surgery alone (19714).\nless\nHyperprolactinemia. Oral German chamomile might lower prolactin levels, but is not likely to work as well as conventional medications.\nPreliminary clinical research in female patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia shows that taking a syrup containing 10% of a German chamomile dried flower extract 5 mL twice daily for 4 weeks produces a significant decline in serum prolactin levels when compared with baseline. However, the decrease is less than that associated with taking cabergoline 0.25 mg twice weekly for 4 weeks. Serum prolactin levels normalized in 96% of patients taking cabergoline, and 72% of patients taking German chamomile (104806).\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there has been interest in using oral German chamomile for IBD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of German chamomile for this purpose.\nInsomnia. Oral German chamomile does not seem to be beneficial in patients with primary insomnia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with primary insomnia shows that taking German chamomile 270 mg twice daily for 28 days does not improve total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, sleep quality, waking after sleep onset, or number of awakenings when compared with placebo (19716).\nless\nLeukemia. It is unclear if oral German chamomile is beneficial in children with leukemia.\nOne small clinical study in children aged 2-18 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia suggests that taking German chamomile flower extract 125 mg in 2.5 mL syrup daily for 30 days during induction chemotherapy is associated with a more rapid recovery in absolute neutrophil counts, but not white blood cell counts, when compared with placebo (103180). However, statistical methods used are unclear, and it is not known if German chamomile altered the effectiveness of chemotherapy.\nless\nMastalgia. Preliminary research suggests that German chamomile might be effective for reducing the pain of premenstrual mastalgia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with cyclic (premenstrual) mastalgia shows that taking 5 drops of German chamomile extract orally three times daily for 2 months reduces the severity of mastalgia when compared with placebo (104811).\nless\nNocturnal enuresis. Topical German chamomile has only been evaluated in combination with almond oil; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in children with enuresis shows that applying 6 drops of almond oil infused with German chamomile flower to the perineal and suprapubic areas nightly for 6 weeks reduces the frequency of enuresis by about 3 episodes per week when compared with placebo (98621).\nless\nOral mucositis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral rinses containing German chamomile might help to prevent or treat oral mucositis associated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).\nClinical research shows that using an oral rinse containing German chamomile extract (Kamillosan Liquidum, Asta Media AG) three times daily might help prevent or treat mucositis associated with radiation therapy and several chemotherapy drugs, but not 5-fluorouracil (6655, 6656). Other clinical research in patients undergoing HSCT shows that using German chamomile 1% oral rinse twice daily along with standard care reduces the risk of oral mucositis by 67% when compared with standard care alone. However, 0.5% and 2% rinses did not decrease the risk, suggesting that the study may have been underpowered to detect differences (99853).\n\nGerman chamomile has also been studied in combination with other herbal ingredients. One clinical study shows that using an oral rinse containing 1% peppermint oil and 1% German chamomile extract, diluted in water, three times daily starting 1 week before HSCT might help to reduce the severity and duration of oral mucositis induced by high-dose pre-HSCT chemotherapy when compared with placebo. However, the oral rinse does not prevent oral mucositis or reduce the duration of hospitalization when compared with placebo (95622). Another small clinical study in adults with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy shows that rinsing with 5 mL of a mouthwash containing German chamomile, peppermint oil, aloe vera, and honey 3 times daily for 60 seconds for 6 weeks starting on the first day of radiotherapy reduces oral mucositis incidence, severity, and pain compared with chlorhexidine and placebo (111291). It is unclear if these findings are due to German chamomile, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral German chamomile for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of German chamomile for this purpose.\nPeriodontitis. German chamomile 1% mouthwash may be similarly effective to chlorhexidine 0.12% mouthwash.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that using 15 mL of a 1% German chamomile flower mouthwash twice daily for 30 days reduces symptoms and severity of periodontitis by a similar amount when compared with chlorhexidine 0.12% mouthwash (104808).\nless\nPressure ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral German chamomile for pressure ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of German chamomile for this purpose.\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical German chamomile is beneficial for preventing dermatitis caused by radiotherapy.\nA small clinical study in adults with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy who developed dry desquamation shows that applying a German chamomile 2.5% compress, 20 minutes 3 times daily, results in complete or partial regression of the dry desquamation in 65% and 35% of patients, respectively, and delays the development of moist desquamation by 5-10 days (111376). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of a comparator group. Another small clinical study in females with breast cancer shows that using a lotion containing a microencapsulated German chamomile extract 0.2%, applied daily after radiation therapy, starting on the first day and continued until the end of treatment, does not improve the incidence or time to onset of any grade of radiation dermatitis on day 35, although it may delay the time to onset of grades 2 or greater, when compared with an identical lotion vehicle control. German chamomile may modestly improve the rate of skin recovery in those with more severe dermatitis over the 15 days following therapy completion (108993). However, due to the small size of the study and short follow-up duration, the validity of these findings is unclear.\nless\nRhinosinusitis. Using German chamomile nose drops might improve symptoms of rhinosinusitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with rhinosinusitis shows that using 3 drops of an ethanolic German chamomile extract in each nostril three times daily for 3 weeks reduces symptom scores and improves quality of life when compared with a sesame seed oil placebo (104810).\nless\nSexual dysfunction. A 5% German chamomile vaginal gel may have similar efficacy to conjugated estrogen vaginal cream in postmenopausal patients.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal patients with sexual dysfunction shows that using a 5% German chamomile vaginal gel, 1 gram nightly for 2 weeks then twice weekly for 10 weeks, decreases dyspareunia and increases sexual satisfaction to a similar extent as conjugated estrogen vaginal cream used in the same dosage (104809).\nless\nVaginitis. Although there has been interest in using oral German chamomile for vaginitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of German chamomile for this purpose.\nVenous leg ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral German chamomile for venous leg ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of German chamomile for this purpose.\nWound healing. It is unclear if topical German chamomile is beneficial for wound healing.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults undergoing abrasive tattoo removal shows that applying a topical German chamomile product (Kamille Spitzner, W. Spitzner Arzneimittelfabrik GmbH) three times daily for 14 days reduces wound size by day 4 of treatment when compared with placebo (19718). However, no significant differences in wound healing were observed after 18 days.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced fatigue. It is unclear if inhaled German chamomile essential oil, as aromatherapy, is beneficial in patients with chemotherapy-induced fatigue.\nA small clinical study in adults with gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine, and skin cancers receiving intravenous infusion therapy shows that inhaling German chamomile essential oil 3 times daily for 7 days does not reduce self-reported fatigue when compared with a control group (111379).\nless\nMore information is needed to rate German chamomile for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of German chamomile is the flower. Active constituents of German chamomile include flavonoids (including quercetin, apigenin, luteolin), coumarins (including umbelliferone), sesquiterpenes (including matricin), terpenoids (including chamazulene, alpha bisabolol, and bisabolol oxides), spiroether, essential oil, polysaccharides, amino acids, fatty acids, and minerals (10377, 103180, 104806, 104808).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro, bisabolol oxide A, a constituent of German chamomile, has demonstrated antiproliferative effects on human leukemia cells (103180).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGerman chamomile might have anti-inflammatory effects. Laboratory research suggests it can inhibit cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes, reducing the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Quercetin and apigenin can inhibit histamine release from mast cells after antigen stimulation (10377, 12729).\nBone effects\nIn vitro research suggests that German chamomile extracts might stimulate osteoblast activity (12728).\nDermatologic effects\nAnimal research suggests that German chamomile flower extract taken orally might have an antipruritic effect (12727).\nGastrointestinal effects\nAnimal research suggests that German chamomile blocks slow wave activity in the small intestine, which could slow peristaltic movement (13398).\nNeurologic effects\nAnimal research suggests that German chamomile extracts might inhibit morphine dependence and withdrawal, possibly by increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) levels (12726).\nSedative effects\nThe constituents responsible for the sedative activity of German chamomile are unclear. Some laboratory research suggests that apigenin binds to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors which are the primary receptor sites of benzodiazepines in the central nervous system. However, other research suggests that apigenin doesn't affect GABA receptors, and other constituents of German chamomile are responsible for the sedative activity (9765, 12725).\nSpasmolytic effects\nLaboratory research suggests that German chamomile might produce spasmolytic effects on smooth muscle tissue by inhibiting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterases (98621)."

Germanium also accumulates in the hair and nails in humans (557). However, organic germanium such as germanium sesquioxide, is water-soluble and does not accumulate in tissues (10051).\nExcretion\nGermanium is primarily excreted by the kidneys (10048, 51782).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGermanium is considered an ultra-trace element, with an atomic number of 32. Germanium exists as inorganic and organic compounds. Organic compounds include germanium sesquioxide and spirogermanium (10051, 51744). Germanium deficiency might be a contributing factor in the etiology of Kashin-Beck disease (10047).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn an animal model, germanium has anti-inflammatory effects (51759). However, the exact mechanisms are poorly understood (10046, 10048, 10051).\nAnticancer properties\nOrganic germanium compounds have been investigated in preliminary clinical research as anticancer compounds (10035, 10037, 10038, 10039, 10049, 10050, 51746). In animal models, organic germanium has been shown to augment natural killer cell activity, prevent cancer, and increase survival (10049, 51741, 51754, 51758, 51764, 51778).\nAntimalarial properties\nSpirogermanium has been shown to inhibit the growth and maturation of plasmodium in vitro (51766). However, the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro, germanium sesquioxide has antioxidant effects (98488). The antioxidant effects of organic germanium might be responsible for some of its clinical effects in laboratory models.\nAntiviral effects\nPreliminary research suggests that germanium might have anti-viral properties. However, the exact mechanism are poorly understood (10046, 10048, 10051).\nImmunological properties\nSome research suggests that germanium might have immunological properties (10046, 10048, 10051). This is supported by one clinical study which found that the blood from patients treated with organic germanium 1200 mg for 8 weeks demonstrated significantly higher ex vivo NK-cell cytotoxic activity and IgG1 concentrations when compared with blood from patients treated with placebo (104528). One possible mechanism of action is induction of cytokines involved in the immune response. In laboratory models, germanium sesquioxide has been shown to induce gamma-interferon production, possibly leading to increased activation of leukocytes (51750, 51758)."

The risk for major malformations in infants of parents who took ginger when pregnant does not appear to be higher than the baseline rate of 1% to 3% (721, 1922, 5343, 11346, 13071, 13080, 96254). Also, other research suggests that ginger intake during various trimesters does not significantly affect the risk of spontaneous abortion, congenital malformations, stillbirth, perinatal death, preterm birth, low birth weight, or low Apgar scores (18211, 90103).

Orally, Number Ten, a specific product composed of rhubarb, ginger, astragalus, red sage, and turmeric, can increase the incidence of loose stools (20346).\n\nFour cases of small bowel obstruction due to ginger bolus have been reported following the ingestion of raw ginger without sufficient mastication (chewing). In each case, the bolus was removed by enterotomy. Ginger is composed of cellulose and therefore is resistant to digestion. It can absorb water, which may cause it to swell and become lodged in narrow areas of the digestive tract (52115).\nless\nGenitourinary\nIn one clinical trial, some patients reported increased menstrual bleeding while taking a specific ginger extract (Zintoma, Goldaru) 250 mg four times daily orally for 3 days (17931). An \"intense\" urge to urinate after 30 minutes was reported in two of eight patients given 0.5-1 gram of ginger (7624). However, this effect has not been corroborated elsewhere. Dysuria, flank pain, perineal pain, and urinary stream interruption have been reported in a 43-year-old male who drank ginger tea, containing 2-3 teaspoons of dry ginger, daily over 15 years. The adverse effects persisted for 4 years and were not associated with increases in urinary frequency or urgency.

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nDysmenorrhea. In people with dysmenorrhea, taking oral ginger seems to reduce pain. Clinical research shows that ginger might be comparable to ibuprofen or mefenamic acid. In addition, taking ginger seems to be beneficial when used as an adjunct to mefenamic acid 250 mg twice daily.\nClinical research in individuals at least 15 years of age shows that ginger can reduce pain from dysmenorrhea. Clinical studies show that taking ginger powder 500-2000 mg daily usually for the first 3-4 days of a menstrual cycle modestly decreases pain severity by an average of 2.3-2.7 points on a 10-point scale when compared to control groups (89889, 89899, 91139, 91892, 96255, 106077). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking ginger does not reduce pain duration when compared with placebo (106077).\n\nClinical research also shows that ginger might be as effective as some anti-inflammatory agents. Taking a specific ginger extract (Zintoma, Goldaru) 250 mg four times daily for 3 days at the beginning of the menstrual period or until pain relief improves symptoms similarly to ibuprofen or mefenamic acid (17931, 96259, 106077). Also, taking a ginger extract 200 mg four times daily for 3-4 days at the beginning of pain is equally effective to taking Novafen, a combination of acetaminophen, caffeine, and ibuprofen (99444).\n\nGinger also seems to improve pain when given as an adjunct to anti-inflammatory agents. A small clinical study in young females with dysmenorrhea shows that adding ginger (Vomigone, Dineh Co.) 500 mg daily to mefenamic acid 250 mg twice daily for 5 days further reduces pain when compared with taking mefenamic acid alone (102464).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Most clinical research shows that taking ginger extract by mouth improves pain in some patients with osteoarthritis. Topical ginger, on the other hand, has not shown benefit for knee osteoarthritis in low quality research.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that taking ginger extract 500-1000 mg daily for 3-12 weeks can modestly improve pain when compared with placebo in some patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip (96253, 103357). However, a meta-analysis of two clinical studies shows that taking ginger extract about 500 mg daily for 6 weeks does not have an effect on function (103357). One small clinical trial in patients with mild osteoarthritis of the knee also shows that taking steamed golden ginger extract 480 mg daily for 12 weeks moderately improves pain and functional scores when compared with placebo (114784).\n\nSome clinical research has also compared ginger to conventional drug treatment. In one clinical trial, there was no significant difference between ginger extract 30 mg daily and ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily for one month in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee (17930). However, taking a specific ginger extract (Eurovita Extract 33; EV ext-33) orally 170 mg three times daily for 3 weeks was significantly less effective than ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily for reducing pain (7048). Since ginger is thought to take several weeks for significant benefit, this trial might not have lasted long enough. Ginger has also been compared with diclofenac. When used orally as 1500 mg daily in two divided doses, ginger is less effective than oral diclofenac 100 mg daily in two divided doses, or the combination of ginger and diclofenac, for 12 weeks (89898).\n\nVarious studies have evaluated formulations containing ginger with other ingredients. These combinations have all been shown to improve osteoarthritis pain, and in some cases, functionality. Studied formulations include ginger (Eurovita Extract 35; EV ext-35) 340 mg with glucosamine (Zinaxin glucosamine, Ferrosan AS) 1000 mg daily for 4 weeks, a ginger extract with an alpinia (Alpinia galanga) extract (Eurovita Extract 77; EV ext-77) 255 mg twice daily for 6 weeks, a ginger extract with curcuminoids, and extracts of devil's claw, Boswellia serrata, and celery (Tregocel) for 36 weeks, or Ayurvedic shunthi-guduchi formulations containing ginger, Indian gooseberry, and Tinospora cordifolia, either with or without Boswellia serrata (7084, 18210, 89557, 106078). However, it's too early to know if the effects of these combination agents are associated with ginger or other ingredients in the formulations.\n\nTopical ginger, alone or in combination with other ingredients, has also been studied for knee osteoarthritis. Although a meta-analysis of two randomized clinical trials shows no evidence of benefit of topical ginger for pain and disability when compared with placebo or standard therapy (103357), some benefits have been shown in individual preliminary studies (20340, 20341, 89897, 96668, 97537, 97542). These trials have used a specific gel containing ginger and plai 4% by weight (Plygersic gel, Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research) 4 grams/day in four divided doses for 6 weeks (89897), an ointment composed of ginger, cinnamon, mastic (Saghez), and sesame oil twice daily for 6 weeks (20340), or one gram of ginger extract 5% (standardized to 11.18% of 6-gingerol) in a nanostructure lipid carrier three times daily for up to 12 weeks to the affected knee (96668, 97537). Some studies have used ginger essential oil in a massage oil, alone or with sweet orange essential oil or standard therapy, twice weekly for 3 or 6 weeks (20341, 97542).\nless\nPregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral ginger seems to reduce the severity of nausea and vomiting in some people during pregnancy. Ginger seems to be more effective than placebo, comparable to vitamin B6 or dimenhydrinate, and less effective than metoclopramide.\nAlthough most clinical studies are small and have methodological limitations, the available research shows that ginger is more effective than placebo, and comparable to vitamin B6 or dimenhydrinate (721, 1922, 5343, 11346, 13071, 16306, 20312, 20315, 90103, 91201, 102462). Although ginger is comparable to dimenhydrinate for reducing symptoms of morning sickness, it seems to take about 3 days to reduce vomiting episodes compared to 1 day with dimenhydrinate (16305). In addition, clinical research shows that ginger is less effective than metoclopramide at relieving nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy (20315). Ginger doses of 500 to 2500 mg daily, divided into two to four daily doses for 3 days to 3 weeks, have been used in clinical research (721, 5343, 16305, 16306, 20312, 20315, 90103, 91201). The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) considers ginger capsules 250 mg 4 times daily a first-line nonpharmacological treatment option for pregnancy-induced nausea based on limited evidence. However, there is no evidence that ginger reduces vomiting (111601).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Most clinical research shows that oral ginger does not reduce acute or delayed CINV. The effect of ginger might depend on the dose, the other antiemetics used, or the specific chemotherapy regimen.\nMost clinical research shows that taking ginger as adjunct to adequate antiemetic therapy does not reduce DELAYED CINV when compared with antiemetic therapy alone (20316, 96260, 89891, 96675, 97538, 97541, 101760, 102461, 113616). Clinical research from meta-analyses and most individual clinical studies also show that taking ginger 0.5-3.5 grams as an adjunct to standard antiemetic therapy does not reduce the incidence or severity of ACUTE CINV when compared with antiemetic therapy alone (89891, 96675, 101760, 102461, 102466, 113616). However, conflicting results exist from some individual clinical studies (20316, 102466). These individual studies evaluated powdered ginger root or liquid extract of ginger root 0.5-2 grams taken in two to four divided doses daily, starting on either the day of or 3 days before chemotherapy and continuing for 3-5 days after chemotherapy initiation (20316, 102466). Also, one small study shows that ginger in doses of 1 gram or less for more than 3 days reduces the likelihood of acute vomiting by 60% (101760). More research is needed to confirm the efficacy of this lower dose.\n\nReasons for the conflicting results are unclear, but several theories have been postulated. One theory is that ginger might help reduce CINV associated with some, but not all, chemotherapy regimens. One preliminary clinical study shows that ginger 500 mg twice daily for 3 days reduces vomiting in patients receiving cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, but not in patients also receiving 5-fluorouracil or docetaxel (96251). However, since there is limited evidence supporting this theory, additional research is needed to confirm.\n\nAnother theory is that ginger helps when used with certain antiemetic drugs, but not others. For example, ginger seems to help in cases when optimal antiemetic therapy, such as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, is not available. Small clinical studies show that ginger reduces the severity of acute nausea when compared with prochlorperazine or metoclopramide, both of which are suboptimal antiemetic therapy for CINV (89891). Another small study shows that ginger is comparable to metoclopramide for improving delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea (13244). On the other hand, several studies show that taking ginger 0.5-2 grams daily along with antiemetic therapy that includes aprepitant does NOT improve acute or delayed CINV (20318, 89891, 96251, 96675). In fact, one study found an association between concomitant use of ginger 2 grams daily with aprepitant and worsened severity of delayed nausea. Ginger is hypothesized to decrease the absorption of aprepitant and reduce its effectiveness for delayed nausea (20318, 96675). However, this effect has not been replicated, and aprepitant serum levels were not measured to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nFinally, many of the studies showing a benefit of ginger for CINV when used as an adjunct to standard antiemetic therapy are considered to be methodologically flawed (20317, 96252, 96677). For instance, one study using powdered ginger root 1-2 grams daily during the first three days of chemotherapy in children and adults (20317) has been criticized for inaccurately representing data (89891). Other studies of ginger 500 mg twice daily for up to 10 days used questionable methods to measure outcomes and usually did not differentiate between acute and delayed CINV (96252, 96677).\n\nGinger essential oil aromatherapy has also been evaluated. One small study shows that using two drops of ginger essential oil on an aromatherapy necklace for 2 minutes daily for 5 days, starting on the first day of chemotherapy, reduces acute nausea, but not vomiting or delayed nausea, when compared with placebo in females with breast cancer taking standard antiemetics including granisetron, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide (96256).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle soreness. Most research shows that oral ginger in single or multiple doses does not prevent or treat exercise-induced muscle soreness.\nTwo small studies in healthy adults show that single doses of ginger supplements do not seem to reduce muscle soreness from exercise. Taking capsules of ground ginger 2 grams, 30 minutes before a 30-minute cycling bout, or 24-48 hours after eccentric exercise, does not reduce muscle pain during exercise or within one hour of ingestion when compared with placebo (17932, 17934). Taking multiple doses also does not seem to help. One small study in healthy adults shows that taking capsules with ginger powder 4 grams daily for 5 days before high-intensity eccentric exercise does not reduce muscle soreness over 4 days when compared with placebo (96258). Another small study in healthy adults shows that taking capsules of heated or raw ground ginger 2 grams daily for 8 days prior to eccentric exercise, and continuing supplementation for 3 more days, might modestly reduce muscle soreness 24 hours post-exercise, but not at later time points, when compared with placebo (17933, 96258).\n\nGinger has also been tested in combination with other ingredients. One small study in healthy adults shows that taking a specific combination product (ReWin(d), Natural Origins) containing a 4:3 ratio of ginger and annatto powder, 2 grams in divided doses daily for 4 weeks before eccentric exercise and continuing for 3 days after exercise, may modestly reduce muscle pain 48 hours after exercise but not at other time points (105057). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer.\nless\nMotion sickness. Most research shows that oral ginger does not prevent or treat motion sickness.\nMost clinical research shows that taking ginger 500-1000 mg up to 4 hours prior to travel does not prevent motion sickness (7624, 7625, 20330, 20331). Some patients report subjective feelings of improvement, but in many studies objective measures did not significantly improve (7400). However, one clinical trial suggests that ginger is more effective than dimenhydrinate at reducing gastrointestinal distress associated with motion sickness (20332). Another clinical study seems to show that taking ginger 1-2 grams as a single dose reduces nausea severity and increases the latency before the onset of nausea caused by simulated motion sickness when compared to baseline (20333). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some small clinical studies show that giving ginger with tube feeds to hospitalized patients might reduce the duration of serious sequelae from ARDS.\nA small clinical trial in adults with ARDS shows that administering ginger extract 120 mg in three divided doses daily via nasogastric tubing for 21 days increases the number of ventilator-free days and the amount of feeding tolerated and decreases the number of intensive care unit (ICU) days when compared with placebo. However, it does not seem to improve overall mortality (20343). Also, another small clinical study shows that adding ginger extract 120 mg to tube feeds in three divided doses daily for 8-21 days improves blood oxygen levels by 13% to 20%, as well as the ability of the lungs to expand by 17%, when compared with a coconut oil placebo. The duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in the ICU also improved. However, ginger does not affect other measurements of lung function or physical organ damage in these patients (89886).\nless\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in allergic rhinitis.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking ginger extract 500 mg daily for 6 weeks is as effective as loratadine 10 mg daily for reducing nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis (103359).\nless\nAntiretroviral-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral ginger seems to improve nausea and vomiting in patients using antiretroviral agents.\nA small clinical study in patients with HIV shows that taking ginger 0.5 grams twice daily, 30 minutes prior to each dose of antiretroviral for 14 days, reduces the relative likelihood of nausea and vomiting by about 63% and 79%, respectively, when compared with placebo (89887).\nless\nAsthma. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition.\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Topical ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical trial in adults and children with eczema shows that applying a combination topical product containing ginger and cannabidiol twice daily for 5 days moderately improves eczema scores, including erythema, dryness, itching, and scaling, when compared to baseline. It is unclear if this effect is due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group (114783).\nless\nBack pain. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for back pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition.\nBurns. Although there has been interest in using topical ginger for burns, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition.\nCancer-related anorexia. It is unclear if oral ginger improves appetite in people with cancer-related anorexia.\nA small clinical study in patients with cancer-related anorexia and cachexia shows that taking a capsule containing ginger 1650 mg daily for 14 days improves nausea, appetite, reflux, dysmotility, and other gastrointestinal symptoms when compared to baseline (102460). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator group.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (AKL1, AKL International Ltd.) containing ginkgo extract, ginger, and Picrorhiza kurroa twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve respiratory symptoms when compared with placebo in patients with COPD (89702). Another moderate-sized clinical study in adults with COPD shows that taking a combination product containing extracts of ginger, alpinia, cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron in honey 3 times daily for 8 weeks improves confidence in leaving home and the ratio of forced exploratory volume per second to forced vital capacity of the lungs (FEV1/FVC) when compared with placebo. However, the combination product does not improve most measures of respiratory function or symptoms such as cough, phlegm, chest tightness, dyspnea, reduced energy levels, sleeping disorders, or activity limitations when compared with placebo (111542). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nColic. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for colic, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition.\nConstipation. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear whether oral ginger is beneficial for patients with COVID-19.\nClinical research in adults hospitalized with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection shows that taking ginger 1.5 grams twice daily orally until hospital discharge reduces length of stay from around 8.5 days to 6 days, when compared with placebo. The strongest effect is seen in males over 60 years of age (110005). The relevance of these results is reduced by a lack of blinding, and the fact that the subjects were initially asymptomatic. Another small study in adults with COVID-19 treated in the community shows that taking ginger 1000 mg three times a day for 7 days does not improve viral clearance, oxygen saturation, or respiratory rate when compared with placebo. Taking ginger also did not reduce the risk of hospitalization (114779).\n\nThe efficacy of ginger for treating COVID-19 has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. In adults with uncomplicated, moderate COVID-19, taking a combination of ginger, turmeric, ashwagandha, and boswellia (BV-4051, Artovid-20), 1776 mg twice daily orally for 14 days in addition to standard care and starting 48-96 hours after symptom onset, reduces the mean duration of symptoms from about 8 days to 7 days, when compared with placebo (109899). A small open-label study in adults with confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking ginger 1000 mg and ashwagandha 500 mg twice daily for 15 days, along with conventional therapy, leads to a 13.8-fold and 2.6-fold increase in the relative rate of clinical cure at 7 days and 15 days, respectively, when compared with conventional therapy alone. Taking this combination also appears to reduce time to recovery by around 6 days but does not improve the rate of negative COVID-19 tests, chest imaging findings, viral clearance, serum antibodies, or other measures of disease progression when compared with conventional therapy alone (112094). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding, and the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, ashwagandha, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetes. Some preliminary clinical studies suggest that oral ginger might have a small beneficial effect on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes.\nMeta-analyses of several small clinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes show that taking ginger 1200-3000 mg daily for 8-13 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by around 0.6% to 1% and fasting blood glucose by 19-21 mg/dL when compared with placebo (96680, 107898). However, a recent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking ginger 1200-2000 mg daily for 4-12 weeks does not improve HbA1c or fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo (114780). The reasons for these discordant results are not entirely clear, but they are likely related to heterogeneity of the included populations, treatment dose, and duration of follow up. Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with diabetes on hemodialysis for end stage renal disease shows that taking ginger powder 2000 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose and measures of insulin resistance, but not serum insulin levels, when compared with placebo (111543).\n\nIn patients with gestational diabetes at weeks 24-28 of pregnancy, clinical research shows that taking ginger 1500 mg daily in three divided doses for 6 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and measures of insulin resistance by a small amount when compared with placebo, with no effect on postprandial glucose levels (103358).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. Topical ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in adults treated with gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy of the foot shows that applying a combination balm containing ginger, menthol, camphor, and other ingredients three times a day for 4 weeks moderately improves pain scores when compared with a placebo balm without ginger but containing menthol, camphor, and other ingredients.(114781). It is unclear if this effect is due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for various types of diarrhea, including cholera and acute bacterial dysentery, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for these conditions.\nDry mouth. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with ginger extract is beneficial for dry mouth.\nIn patients with dry mouth related to type 2 diabetes, clinical research shows that use of a ginger extract 25% mouthwash 20 mL three times daily for 14 days modestly reduces symptoms of dry mouth when compared with rinsing with a saline control mouthwash (106068). Although this study was indicated as being triple-blind, it is unclear how the taste of ginger was masked.\nless\nDyspepsia. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for dyspepsia.\nIn patients with dyspepsia, a small clinical trial shows that a single dose of ginger root powder 1.2 grams, taken 1 hour prior to eating, does not reduce abdominal discomfort when compared with placebo. However, it increases the rate of gastric emptying (20325).\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for erectile dysfunction.\nPreliminary clinical research in middle-aged males with ED shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (Revactin, MD Concepts LLC) containing ginger root 250 mg, muira puama 250 mg, guarana 250 mg, and L-citrulline 800 mg twice daily for 3 months improves scores related to erectile function and intercourse satisfaction, but does not improve sexual desire or orgasmic function scores, when compared to baseline (103224). This study is limited by the lack of a placebo control, the use of per-protocol analysis, and a high dropout rate. In fact, 44% of patients withdrew in order to resume use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Further, it is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHangover. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for managing symptoms of hangover.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that use of a decoction containing a combination of ginger 6 grams, pith of Citrus tangerine 3 grams, and brown sugar decreases symptoms of alcohol hangovers, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, when compared with placebo. The decoction was taken once 5 hours prior to drinking alcohol or four times after drinking alcohol (20320).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral ginger may be modestly beneficial for some patients with hyperlipidemia.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in adults with and without hyperlipidemia shows that taking ginger 200-3000 mg orally daily for 2-24 weeks reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 12 mg/dL and 5 mg/dL, respectively, and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 1 mg/dL when compared with placebo (109521). However, the validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity. A clinical study in adults with hyperlipidemia shows that taking ginger powder 1 gram three times daily for 45 days reduces triglyceride and cholesterol levels by an additional 36% and 90%, respectively, when compared with placebo (20327).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for lowering blood pressure.\nA preliminary clinical study in patients with diabetes and elevated systolic blood pressure shows that drinking black tea containing ginger 3 grams three times daily for 8 weeks does not reduce blood pressure by a clinically significant amount when compared with plain black tea (96669).\nless\nHypothyroidism. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in patients with hypothyroidism.\nA small clinical study in patients with primary hypothyroidism who are stabilized on thyroid hormone therapy shows that taking ginger powder 500 mg twice daily for 30 days improves symptoms associated with hypothyroidism, including cold intolerance, constipation, dizziness, dry skin, weight gain, and concentration and memory issues, when compared with placebo. However, ginger supplementation does not seem to improve hair loss, hearing, nail fragility, speech, or feelings of depression in these patients (107903).\nless\nInsect bite. It is unclear if topical ginger is beneficial for reducing the size of insect bites.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that a topical application of Trikatu, which contains ginger, long pepper, and black pepper extracts with 0.074% piperine and 0.046% gingerol, does not reduce the papule size associated with mosquito bites when compared with a control compound containing the same base ingredients of camphor 2%, menthol 2%, and eucalyptus oil 4% (89893).\nless\nIntraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for preventing IONV.\nClinical research in individuals undergoing elective C-section and receiving cimetidine and metoclopramide, shows that taking ginger 1 gram orally 30 minutes prior to anesthesia reduces the number of episodes of intraoperative nausea, but not vomiting, when compared with placebo (89890). In other clinical research in adults undergoing elective surgical procedures, adding ginger to a high calorie drink consumed pre-operatively reduces the incidence of nausea from 40% to 10%, and the incidence of vomiting from 25% to 10% when compared with the high calorie drink alone (110007). The validity of these results is unclear as only patients were blinded to the treatment group.\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral ginger might reduce symptoms of IBS when used in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking ginger 1-2 grams daily for 28 days does not improve symptoms or the number of responders when compared with placebo (90102). However, some research shows that ginger might be beneficial in some patients when used along with other herbal ingredients. Taking a capsule containing ginger, boswellia, and yarrow three times daily for 30 days reduces the frequency and severity of abdominal pain, as well as the severity of bloating, when compared with placebo in females, but not males, with mild to moderate IBS (96673). Another clinical study shows that taking an herbal mixture containing ginger, English horsemint, and purple nut sedge tuber three times daily for 8 weeks improves IBS symptoms including abdominal pain, stool frequency, stool consistency, incomplete evacuation, and urgency, when compared to baseline; these improvements are similar to those achieved by taking mebeverine 135 mg three times daily (89900). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nJoint pain. Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital) containing glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg, methylsufonlylmethane 500 mg, white willow bark extract 250 mg, ginger root concentrate 50 mg, Boswellia extract 125 mg, turmeric root extract 50 mg, cayenne 40 m H.U. 50 mg, and hyaluronic acid 4 mg in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain severity by 37% compared to only 16% with placebo. However, it does not improve joint stiffness or function when compared with placebo (89560). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for menopausal symptoms such as insomnia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this purpose.\nMenorrhagia. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for menorrhagia.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy adults experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding shows that taking ginger 250 mg three times daily for 4 days, starting the day prior to menstruation, and repeating for three menstrual cycles, reduces the amount of menstrual bleeding when compared with placebo (96672).\nless\nMigraine headache. Small clinical studies suggest that oral ginger may modestly reduce migraine pain severity and duration. However, taking ginger doesn't seem to PREVENT migraines.\nGinger does not seem to be effective for the prevention of migraines. Clinical research in patients with episodic migraine shows that taking ginger extract 200 mg three times daily for 3 months does not reduce the number of migraine attacks, the use of analgesics, or the number of days with pain, any more than taking placebo (101761).\n\nHowever, ginger may be beneficial for the treatment of migraine. Clinical research shows that taking ginger extract 400 mg orally in the emergency room along with intravenous ketoprofen 100 mg reduces pain over the next 2 hours when compared with ketoprofen and placebo. This combination also resulted in an overall better response with a higher likelihood of having no or mild pain with treatment (101762). Taking ginger 250 mg at the onset of a common migraine headache seems to be as effective as taking sumatriptan 50 mg for reducing headache severity within two hours of treatment (89894). Furthermore, a combination of ginger and feverfew (GelStat Migraine, GelStat Corporation; LipiGesic M, PuraMed BioScience), administered sublingually at the onset of a migraine attack, decreases the duration and intensity of migraine pain when compared with placebo (19357, 22602). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, feverfew, or the combination. Feverfew alone has demonstrated some benefit in treating migraines.\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for MS.\nA small clinical study in adults with MS shows that taking ginger 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks reduces disability scores and improves physical and psychological quality of life scores when compared with placebo (111541). Another small clinical study in adults with relapsing-remitting MS shows that taking ginger 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks reduces the frequency and severity of nausea and constipation and the severity but not frequency of bloating when compared with placebo. However, no improvement was noted in other gastrointestinal symptoms of MS including abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, dysphagia, gas, or heartburn (113614).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for NAFLD.\nA small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking ginger 1000 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves liver steatosis scores but not liver fibrosis scores when compared with placebo. Ginger also modestly improves levels of alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase but not aspartate aminotransferase (113615). However, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant. Another small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking ginger root 1500 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and fasting blood glucose levels, but does not affect triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, insulin resistance, blood pressure, or fatty liver index, when compared with placebo (102465).\nless\nObesity. Oral ginger has primarily been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAlthough some individual research disagrees (40802), a meta-analysis and most individual clinical trials show that taking ginger alone or with other ingredients does not reduce weight by a clinically significant amount when compared with placebo in overweight or obese individuals (20346, 20347, 96676, 109521). Ginger has been taken alone or in combination with green tea and capsaicin; rhubarb, astragalus, red sage, turmeric, and gallic acid (Number Ten); or raspberry ketone (Razberi K, Integrity Nutraceuticals), caffeine, capsicum extract (Capsimax, OmniActive Health Technologies), bitter orange fruit (Advantra Z, Nutratech Inc), L-theanine, and black pepper fruit extract (Biperine, Sabinsa Corporation) (Prograde Metabolism) (20346, 20347, 40802, 96676). Due to the various other ingredients contained in available formulations, any effect from ginger is unclear.\nless\nOral mucositis. Topical ginger, as a mouthwash, has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients undergoing chemotherapy shows that using 10 mL of a mouthwash containing ginger for 14 days does not improve oral mucositis severity or pain when compared with saline, although a modest improvement in severity was noted after 7 days of treatment with the ginger containing mouthwash. The mouthwash contained ginger 4% and honey 7% and was used for 2 minutes 3 times daily (116439). The interpretation of these results is limited by the low overall mucositis severity reported during the study. Also, it is unclear if any effect is due to ginger, honey, or the combination.\nless\nParturition. It is unclear if bathing in a ginger bath is beneficial for shortening the duration of labor.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that bathing in 228 liters of water containing 4 drops of ginger essential oil does not shorten the duration of labor when compared with a regular bath (20345).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for females with PCOS.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with PCOS shows that taking ginger 500 mg three times daily orally for 8 weeks decreases body weight, body mass index, and levels of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, when compared with placebo. It does not affect testosterone levels (110006).\nless\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Evidence for the use of oral ginger for preventing PONV is inconclusive and conflicting. Reasons for the conflicting findings may relate to the ginger formulation used and the outcomes measured. It is unclear if ginger aromatherapy is beneficial for PONV.\nSome individual clinical studies, as well as a large, recent meta-analysis of the available clinical research, show that taking ginger by mouth 1 hour prior to surgery does not reduce the incidence of 24-hour PONV (3452, 3453, 17369, 99445). Also, the meta-analysis found that, although ginger reduces the severity of PONV when measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), it does not reduce the severity of PONV when measured on a verbal descriptive scale (VDS). Furthermore, ginger does not reduce the use of rescue antiemetic medications (99445).\n\nHowever, some small, individual clinical studies and a meta-analysis of older clinical research show that taking ginger by mouth prior to surgery reduces the incidence of 24-hour PONV by up to 16% to 38% (722, 723, 1919, 13237, 20336, 20338, 20339). In addition, large clinical trials show that the frequency and severity of PONV 2-6 hours after surgery are similar when ginger 1 gram is given orally or when medications such as metoclopramide or dexmedetomidine are given intravenously prior to undergoing anesthesia (103356, 103360). However, taking ginger prior to general anesthesia, in combination with other antiemetics like dexamethasone or cimetidine and metoclopramide, does not seem to reduce nausea and vomiting when compared with the other medications alone (20337, 89890).\n\nIn contrast, other research shows that powdered ginger 1-2 grams 30-60 minutes before induction of anesthesia has been used in most studies showing benefit, occasionally followed by 1 gram of ginger administered two hours after surgery (722, 723, 13237, 20336, 20338, 103356, 103360). Ginger aromatherapy has also been evaluated for the prevention of PONV. Application of 5% ginger essential oil to the wrists of patients prior to the induction of general anesthesia seems to prevent PONV in approximately 80% of treated patients (20334). Also, use of ginger essential oil aromatherapy on a gauze pad results in nausea relief in approximately 67% of patients compared with 40% in the placebo group; however, a blend of essential oils including ginger, spearmint, peppermint, and cardamom, results in nausea relief in 82% of patients (89888).These conflicting findings may be due to differences in outcome measures and the chemical compositions of ginger preparations used in the various clinical studies.\n\nSome evidence suggests that the efficacy of ginger for preventing PONV differs based on the formulation used. A network meta-analysis of 18 studies evaluating various ginger preparations, including ginger oil, ginger powder, ginger extract, and a combination of ginger powder and antiemetics, for the prevention of PONV suggests that ginger powder and ginger oil are the most effective formulations for preventing nausea and vomiting, respectively. The analysis also shows that while no ginger formulation is superior to another for the prevention of nausea, ginger powder and ginger oil have a lower risk of postoperative vomiting when compared with ginger extract. A subgroup analysis suggests that ginger seems to be most effective in adults over 30 years of age, when administered preoperatively, and when used for gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, obstetric, or ophthalmic surgeries (112108).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for postoperative recovery.\nOne preliminary clinical study in adults who had a tonsillectomy shows that taking a specific ginger supplement (Solgar, Leonia) 500 mg twice daily for 7 days along with acetaminophen and antibiotics modestly improves pain and wound healing when compared with acetaminophen and antibiotics alone (96674).\nless\nPostpartum complications. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in patients with postpartum pain.\nA small clinical study in patients recovering from vaginal delivery shows that taking ginger powder 500 mg 8-hours post-delivery, followed by 250 mg every 8 hours thereafter for 24 hours, reduces postpartum pain by nearly 1 point on a 10-point rating scale when compared with placebo (107904). It is unclear if this improvement would be considered clinically relevant.\nless\nRadiation-induced nausea and vomiting. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in patients with radiation-induced nausea and vomiting.\nA very small study in adults with cervical cancer undergoing treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy shows that taking ginger 250-500 mg twice daily for 6 weeks in addition to standard antiemetic therapy does not reduce acute or delayed nausea and vomiting when compared with antiemetic therapy alone (113616).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). One small clinical study suggests that oral ginger may improve some symptoms of RA.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with RA shows that taking ginger powder 1500 mg daily for 12 weeks improves disease activity on the Disease Activity Score-28 when compared with placebo (100697). Another small study in adults with RA shows that taking a combination product containing ginger, ashwagandha, black pepper, and colchicum luteum twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve RA disease scores when compared with celecoxib 100 mg orally twice daily (114785). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by. poor methodology, and the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nSmoking cessation. Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA moderate-sized clinical study in adults in India with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing ginger 50 mg, ashwagandha, cowhage, turmeric and other herbal extracts (Smotect, Smotect India) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked by approximately 3 per day when compared with placebo. This product also reduces levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity (112115). However, only data from patients who completed treatment were analyzed, which limits the validity of this study. It is also unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nSwallowing dysfunction. The effects of oral ginger for treating swallowing dysfunction are inconclusive. Reasons for the conflicting findings may relate to the route of administration or the number of treatments provided.\nClinical research shows that applying a spray containing ginger and clematix root (Tongyan) to the oropharynx for 28 days is more effective than placebo at treating grade 2 or 3 dysphagia in stroke victims. However, there does not seem to be a beneficial effect in patients with grade 1 dysphagia (20342). Other clinical research in elderly patients with dysphagia shows that taking a single dose of ginger 2 mg orally does not improve swallowing but increases saliva (96671). It is possible that a single dose of ginger is not enough to improve swallowing function.\nless\nToxin-induced liver damage. Oral ginger might help to prevent liver damage in patients using antimycobacterial drugs.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that a specific ginger supplement (Zintoma, Goldaru) 500 mg taken 30 minutes prior to antimycobacterial drugs daily for 4 weeks reduces the percentage of patients experiencing an increase in liver function enzymes to greater than five times the upper limit of normal by 54% when compared with placebo. Antimycobacterial drugs used for tuberculosis in the study included isoniazid 5 mg/kg, rifampin 10 mg/kg, ethambutol 15 mg/kg, and pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg daily (96670).\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary research in young adults with subjective memory dysfunction associated with mild TBI, shows that taking a combination of ginger 36 mg and boswellia 360 mg (Memoral) every 8 hours orally for one month improves scores for some, but not all, parameters on an auditory-visual learning test performed at one and three months, when compared with placebo. Total learning scores increased by about 7.5 points with the ginger combination product, compared with 4 points for placebo (110132). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, boswellia, or the combination.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for improving symptoms of ulcerative colitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with ulcerative colitis shows that taking ginger powder 1000 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves disease activity as measured by the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index Questionnaire when compared with taking placebo. However, taking ginger did not improve quality of life, stool frequency, bowel distress, or flatulence when compared with placebo (100694). It is possible that this study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in these secondary outcomes.\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for various upper respiratory tract infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition.\nVertigo. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for improving symptoms of vertigo.\nA small clinical study shows that taking 1 gram of ginger orally as a single dose prior to stimulated vertigo seems to reduce symptoms of vertigo, including nausea, when compared with placebo. However, it does not seem to reduce nystagmus (7623).\nless\nGastroenteritis-associated nausea and vomiting. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for children with gastroenteritis-associated vomiting.\nIn children aged 1-10 years with acute gastroenteritis-associated vomiting, clinical research shows that taking a single dose of ginger reduces the risk of vomiting at least once in the subsequent 8 hours by 20% when compared with placebo. The incidence of vomiting over the next 24 and 48 hours was also modestly reduced. The children were given 20 drops of ginger equivalent to 10 mg immediately, followed by every 8 hours until cessation of vomiting. All children were offered hypotonic oral rehydration solution (ORS) 30 minutes after the first dose (106076). The number of children accepting ORS, and the quantity of ORS consumed, was less in the group receiving placebo. It is unclear if this affected the outcomes of this study. Also, the incidence or severity of nausea was not investigated.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate ginger for these uses.",

Three case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking ginger and cancer medications that are CYP3A4 substrates (imatinib, dabrafenib, and crizotinib). However, the causality of this interaction is unclear due to the presence of multiple interacting drugs and routes of administration (111644).\n\nConversely, other in vitro research suggests that ginger induces CYP3A4 activity, leading to reduced levels of CYP3A4 substrates (111404).

Two case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking ginger and cancer medications that are P-gp substrates (trametinib, crizotinib).

In another case report, ginger increased the INR when taken with a combination of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, and acetaminophen (20349). A longitudinal analysis suggests that taking ginger increases the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin for at least 4 months (20348). However, research in healthy people suggests that ginger has no effect on INR, or the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin (12881, 15176).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with ginger.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing consumption of ginger, glucuronides, thiol-conjugates, and sulfates of 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, and 6-shogaol were detected (52017). After taking ginger 1-2 grams orally, maximum concentrations occur at 40-80 minutes (52017, 109522). At one hour after administration of 2 grams of ginger, peak plasma concentrations of free 10-gingerol and 6-shogaol were 9.5 ± 2.2 ng/mL and 13.6 ± 6.9 ng/mL, respectively, with undetectable levels at most time points later than 24 hours (52085). In another study, detectable free 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, or 6-shogaol was lacking in healthy individuals (52017).\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that ginger extract and its bioactive compound, 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (DMF), might increase drug absorption by inhibiting intestinal drug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Additionally, ginger and DMF appear to increase the absorption of therapeutic drugs with low oral bioavailability from the apical to basolateral side of epithelial cells, suggesting that ginger may help to increase absorption of drugs with poor bioavailability (111539).\nDistribution\n6-Gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, and 6-shogaol and their metabolites lacked evidence of accumulation in plasma or colon tissues following multiple daily doses of ginger (52085). In an in vitro model, 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, and 6-shogaol were able to cross the blood brain barrier. Other related ginger constituents were not (101759).\nMetabolism\nConjugates of the gingerols and 6-shogaol are usually glucuronide or sulfate conjugates, and not mixed conjugates. However, mixed conjugates of some constituents do occur (52017, 109522). In healthy individuals, ginger consumption resulted in increases of 6-shogaol glucuronides and the 6-gingerol sulfate conjugate. 10-Gingerol or 6-shogaol sulfates were not detected in most individuals (52017). In a separate study, at one hour after administration of 2 grams of ginger, peak plasma concentrations of glucuronide metabolites of 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, and 6-shogaol were 0.47 ± 0.31 mcg/mL, 0.17 ± 0.14 mcg/mL, 0.37 ± 0.19 mcg/mL, and 0.73 ± 0.54 mcg/mL, respectively, and the peak sulfate metabolite concentrations were 0.28 ± 0.15 mcg/mL, 0.027 ± 0.018 mcg/mL, 0.018 ± 0.006 mcg/mL, and 0.047 ± 0.035 mcg/mL, respectively (52085).\nExcretion\nIn human plasma, the half-life of 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, 10-gingerol, and 6-shogaol has been estimated to be 0.5-3 hours (52017, 52085, 109522).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of ginger are the rhizome and root. Active constituents of ginger include gingerol, gingerdione, shogaol, and sesquiterpene and monoterpene volatile oils (12632, 16305, 51791, 51836, 101759). The chemical constituents of ginger vary among fresh, semi-dry, and dry forms of ginger (12632).These constituents seem to have a variety of pharmacological properties including antipyretic, analgesic, antitussive, anti-inflammatory, sedative, antibiotic, weak antifungal, and other properties (7628, 12632). However, all of these pharmacological effects may not occur when whole ginger preparations are used.\nAnalgesic effects\nGinger is traditionally used for low back and stomach pain. In human research, ginger, with or without feverfew, is effective at reducing pain associated with migraine headaches (19357, 22602, 89894, 101761). Ginger may also help in the reduction of muscle pain following eccentric exercise (17933). Analgesic effects of ginger have also been shown in animal pain models (20403). In animal research, a possible mechanisms of action has been suggested relating to the inhibitory effect of 6-shogaol on the release of substance P (51828). Substance P is a neuropeptide that is associated with inflammation and pain. Another possible mechanism of action is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by gingerols and shogaols (101761).\nAnthelmintic effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that ginger may have anthelmintic effects (7628). In animal research, both ginger powder and ginger extract had anthelmintic effects with respective maximum reductions of 25.6% and 66.6% in eggs per gram (EPG) of feces on day 10 of post-treatment in sheep (51924).\nAnti-diabetic effects\nAnimal and human evidence suggests that ginger may increase insulin levels and/or decrease blood glucose levels (12636, 20402, 20403, 20404, 20405, 89895, 89896, 107898). Also, in laboratory models of diabetes, ginger seems to increase the release of insulin and lower cholesterol levels (12636). In streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, ginger produced a significant increase in insulin levels and a decrease in fasting glucose levels and also caused a decrease in serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride, and blood pressure (12636, 20402, 20403, 20404, 20405).\nAnti-emetic effects\nThe mechanism of action of ginger's effect on nausea and vomiting remains uncertain. However, there are several proposed mechanisms that have been investigated in laboratory models. The ginger constituents gingerols and shogaols might have antiemetic effects (51900). Preclinical research has shown that the 6-gingerol constituent can inhibit neurokinin-1, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. This might be one of the mechanisms by which ginger reduces nausea and vomiting (1924, 97539). In fact, some clinical research shows that adding 6-gingerol 10 mg twice daily to standard antiemetic therapy with ondansetron, metoclopramide, and dexamethasone seems to reduce the need for rescue therapy and reduce both acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced vomiting compared to standard antiemetic therapy alone in cancer patients located in Asia and receiving mostly highly emetogenic chemotherapy (97539).\n\nSome researchers have suggested that ginger might work by increasing gastrointestinal (GI) motility (1923, 52001, 52150). However, some evidence shows that ginger does not influence GI emptying time (7621, 7624). Other ginger constituents such as 6-shogaol and galanolactone seem to act on serotonin and muscarinic receptors in the GI tract (1924, 18211, 52049, 52187). Galanolactone seems to act primarily on 5-HT3 receptors in the ileum, which are the same receptors affected by some prescription antiemetics such as ondansetron (Zofran). The gingerols and shogaols from ginger all appear to have 5-HT3 receptor antagonistic effects (51900, 51917, 52049). The predominant antiemetic action of ginger is localized in the GI tract, but there is some evidence that ginger constituents may also have central nervous system (CNS) activity (1924, 18211).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGinger is sometimes used for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-inflammatory effects of ginger have been shown in various animal models (20403, 52035). Researchers speculate that certain constituents of ginger inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase pathways, and leukotrienes, as shown in laboratory research (7401, 18210, 51859, 51868). In human and laboratory research, ginger inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines (12473, 51887, 52031, 52035, 89886, 103355, 107899), possibly via inhibition of the NF kappa B pathway (52038, 52043, 52053, 100697) and stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (52053). It also seems to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), which mediate inflammation (12634, 51932, 52031). PGE2 levels decreased in human colonic mucosa following intake of ginger root extract (52091). The effect of ginger on the NF kappa B pathway also appears to attenuate the production of nitric oxide synthase in laboratory research (51933).\nAnti-platelet effects\nLaboratory research shows that ginger inhibits platelet aggregation. However, this has not been demonstrated unequivocally in humans (96257). In human research, taking ginger 5 grams with a fatty meal inhibited platelet aggregation (52126). However, taking a lower dose of 2 grams did not reduce platelet aggregation in the absence of a high fat meal (52128). The antiplatelet effect of ginger is thought to be exerted by the ability of some of its constituents to inhibit platelet thromboxane (7622, 12634, 52105, 52120). However, in human research ginger did not inhibit thromboxane production (52139).\nAntibacterial effects\nIt is possible that ginger may be beneficial for bacterial infections. Laboratory research suggests ginger extract, ginger essential oils, and ginger constituents have antibacterial effects against a range of organisms, such as Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes (51821, 51912, 52021). In vitro, ginger extract inhibited the growth of Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, bacteria that play a role in gastrointestinal symptoms (39783, 49487).\nAntifungal effects\nGinger exerted antifungal effects against a wide range of fungi, including drug-resistant strains, via its constituents, 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerols and 6-gingerdiol (51824, 51836). However, other studies reported low efficacy of ginger essential oils against various fungi (52026).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of ginger may explain some of its clinical effects. Ginger and its constituents, including 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerol, and 6-shogaol, have demonstrated antioxidant effects such as increasing glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in various forms of research, including in vitro, animal, and clinical research (4067, 40694, 51827, 51843, 51891, 51906, 51915, 51959, 51976, 51990)(52064, 52066, 52069, 105059, 107900).\nBlood pressure effects\nThere is interest in using ginger to lower blood pressure. Animal research shows that fresh ginger extract blocks calcium channels, stimulates muscarinic receptors, and has negative inotropic and chronotropic effects (12633, 51905). However, preliminary clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that drinking black tea containing 3 grams of ginger three times daily for 8 weeks does not affect endothelial function nor reduce blood pressure by a clinically significant amount when compared with placebo (96669). Other preliminary clinical research in healthy adult females shows that taking ginger extract 600 mg orally daily for 3 months also does not lower blood pressure when compared with placebo (109520).\nCognitive effects\nGinger might increase levels of dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine in the brain cortex and hippocampus, which could improve cognitive function (110132).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using oral ginger for modulation of the fecal microbiome. A small clinical study in adults with colorectal adenoma shows that taking ginger 500 mg orally for 6 weeks does not improve fecal microbial diversity when compared with placebo (113771).\nGastroprotective effects\nGinger is traditionally used for stomach and gastrointestinal ailments. Also, gastroprotective effects of ginger have been shown in various animal models (52099). Preliminary research suggests gastroprotective effects of ginger might be due to increases in levels of protective prostaglandins in the gut wall (18210). In an animal model of ulcerative colitis, ginger extract improved levels of inflammatory cytokines and improved antioxidant effects, suggesting these pathways may play a role (52007). Animal research suggests the constituents zingiberene and 6-gingerol may be the important constituents (52107). The constituent 6-gingerol inhibited the formation of HCl-induced gastric lesions, possibly through an interaction with the vanilloid-receptor (51863). Some constituents of ginger have been shown to affect intestinal motility in animal models. For example, 6-shogaol when given orally enhanced gastrointestinal motility (51908, 52096) and ginger extract prevented a delay in gastric emptying (51811). In patients with functional dyspepsia, a single dose of ginger also increased gastric emptying (20325).\nImmunomodulating effects\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shows that ginger increases FoxP3 gene expression. This allows for proper development of regulatory T cells, which help suppress the autoimmune response of effector T cells. Ginger also appears to decrease the expression of the ROR gamma t and T-bet genes, both of which are believed to be involved in the autoimmune process (100697).\nInsecticidal effects\nIn human research, a topical application of Trikatu, which contains ginger, long pepper, and black pepper extracts does not reduce the papule size associated with mosquito bites (89893). However, ginger is traditionally used for its insecticidal effects. Ginger has demonstrated both larvicidal and repellent activity against various types of mosquitoes (51996, 52024). Also, its essential oils have demonstrated ovicidal activity against mosquito species (31384), which may be attributed to 4-gingerol (52009).\nLipid-lowering effects\nClinical evidence suggests that taking ginger reduces triglyceride and cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipidemia (20327). Similar effects have been shown in animal research (12634, 51916, 52147). Other studies failed to demonstrate any lipid-lowering effects of ginger (46881). In an animal model of hyperlipidemia, ginger decreased the endothelium intima-media thickness (51952).\nMusculoskeletal effects\nThere is interest in using ginger to treat various musculoskeletal conditions. Preliminary clinical research in generally healthy adults with self-reported shoulder stiffness shows that taking ginger extract 100 mg orally daily for 8 weeks does not improve stiffness scores when compared with placebo (114782).\nMutagenic effects\nThere is very preliminary evidence that some extracts and constituents of ginger might have mutagenic properties. However, these constituents may only be mutagenic when in the presence of other mutagens. Whole ginger preparations may not have mutagenic effects. Also, other ginger constituents such as zingerone have the opposite effect and are antimutagenic (11299). Ginger constituents 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol have also demonstrated antimutagenic effects. Preliminary research shows that shogaol and 6-gingerol increased apoptosis of head and neck cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (97540).\nOphthalmic effects\nThere is interest in using ginger to treat various ophthalmic conditions. Preliminary clinical research in generally healthy adults with self-reported eye fatigue shows that taking ginger extract 100 mg orally daily for 8 weeks modestly improves fatigue scores, but not ocular blood flow, when compared with placebo (114782).\nRespiratory effects\nGinger is traditionally used in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, cough, respiratory distress, and bronchitis. Ginger does not appear to benefit respiratory function in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (89702). However, administration via nasogastric tubing improves symptoms in adults with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) (20343, 89886). Mechanisms of action are unclear. However, in laboratory research, ginger inhibits airway contraction and associated Ca(2+) signaling, possibly via blockade of plasma membrane Ca(2+) channels (52002). In a mouse model of Th2-mediated pulmonary inflammation, ginger aqueous extract, administered intraperitoneally prior to airway challenge, resulted in a marked decrease in the recruitment of eosinophils to the lungs (52015).\nSex hormone effects\nGinger inhibits thromboxane synthetase. This could affect testosterone receptor binding in the fetus and theoretically affect sex steroid differentiation of the fetal brain (7083). However, this has not been seen in animals or humans. In animal research, ginger extract increased testosterone levels and the weight of the testis (51822).\nTeratogenic effects\nAnimal research hasn't shown any evidence of teratogenicity (11297, 11298). However, one study did find evidence of embryo mortality (11298).\nWeight loss effects\nThere is interest in using ginger for weight loss. Mechanisms of action have been explored in animal models using ginger constituents and ginger extracts. Azingerone reduced body weight and adipose tissue weight in ovariectomized rats, an effect that may be a result of an increase in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in adipocytes (52012). In vitro, ginger, possibly via one of the gingerols, enhanced adipocyte differentiation (51880).\n\nHowever, clinical research in non-obese adults shows that ginger does not affect postprandial energy expenditure, resting energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, or levels of hormones involved in satiety when compared with placebo, although self-reported feelings of satiety were reduced (52095, 109520). Preliminary clinical research in overweight individuals is conflicting and shows ginger may reduce body weight and body fat when used as part of a specific diet and exercise program, but not when used alone (20346, 20347, 40802, 109520)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Ginkgo biloba is a large tree, growing up to 40 meters in height, with fan-shaped leaves that have radiating veins. The fruit is foul-smelling and inedible, but contains a single semi-edible nut (89714, 112946). It is native to temperate Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, but is now cultivated in Europe and the United States (2660, 89715). It is the last remaining species of a primitive family of gymnosperms called Ginkgoaceae (89714). Ginkgo has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine (89714). It is used in cosmetics as a skin conditioning agent and antioxidant (112946).",
            "Warnings": "Ginkgo is a popular dietary supplement. Extracts are commonly adulterated with rutin and quercetin from cheaper sources to make substandard ginkgo extracts seem satisfactory to buyers and regulatory authorities. Not all tests can detect poor quality and adulterated ginkgo supplements (100857, 100858).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Standardized ginkgo leaf extracts have been used safely in trials lasting for several weeks up to 6 years (1514, 1515, 3461, 5717, 5718, 6211, 6212, 6213, 6214, 6215)(6216, 6222, 6223, 6224, 6225, 6490, 14383, 14499, 16634, 16635)(16636, 16637, 17402, 17716, 17718, 87794, 87819, 87826, 87848, 87864)(87888, 87897, 87901, 87904, 89701, 89707, 107359, 107360, 116620). There have been some reports of arrhythmias associated with ginkgo leaf extract. However, it is not yet clear if ginkgo might cause arrhythmia (105253, 105254). There is some concern about toxic and carcinogenic effects seen in animals exposed to a ginkgo leaf extract containing 31.2% flavonoids, 15.4% terpenoids, and 10.45 ppm ginkgolic acid, in doses of 100 to 2000 mg/kg five times per week for 2 years (18272). However, the clinical relevance of this data for humans, using typical doses, is unclear. The content of the extract used is not identical to that commonly used in supplement products, and the doses studied are much higher than those typically used by humans. A single dose of 50 mg/kg in rats is estimated to be equivalent to a single dose of about 240 mg in humans (18272).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used intravenously, short-term. A standardized ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761 ONC has been safely administered intravenously for up to 14 days (9871, 9872, 107360, 107452). A Chinese preparation containing ginkgo leaf extract and dipyridamole has been safely administered intravenously for up to 30 days (102881, 102882). ...when applied topically, short-term. There was no dermal irritation during a 24-hour patch test using the leaf extract, and no sensitization with repeat applications (112946). When used topically in cosmetics, extracts of ginkgo leaves are reported to be safe, but there is insufficient data to determine the safety of nut and root extracts, and isolated biflavones and terpenoids (112946).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when the roasted seed or crude ginkgo plant is used orally. Consuming more than 10 roasted seeds per day can cause difficulty breathing, weak pulse, seizures, loss of consciousness, and shock (8231, 8232). Crude ginkgo plant parts can exceed concentrations of 5 ppm of the toxic ginkgolic acid constituents and can cause severe allergic reactions (5714).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when the fresh ginkgo seed is used orally. Fresh seeds are toxic and potentially deadly (11296).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term (87790, 89708). A specific ginkgo dried extract (Ginko T.D., Tolidaru Pharmaceuticals), has been safely used in doses of 80-120 mg daily for 6 weeks in children aged 6-14 years (17112, 95669). Another specific combination product containing ginkgo leaf extract and American ginseng extract (AD-FX, CV Technologies, Canada) has also been safely used in children aged 3-17 years for up to 4 weeks (8235).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY UNSAFE when ginkgo seed is used orally. The fresh seeds have caused seizures and death in children (8231, 11296).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally. There is concern that ginkgo might have labor-inducing and hormonal effects. There is also concern that the antiplatelet effects of ginkgo could prolong bleeding time if taken around the time of labor and delivery (15052). Theoretically, ginkgo might adversely affect pregnancy outcome; avoid using during pregnancy.\nLACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, ginkgo leaf extract is generally well tolerated when used for up to 6 years. However, the seed and crude plant contain toxic constituents and should be avoided.\n\nIntravenously, ginkgo leaf extract seems to be well tolerated when used for up to 30 days.\n\nTopically, no adverse effects have been reported with ginkgo as a single ingredient. However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Arrhythmia, bleeding, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\nCardiovascular\nCardiac arrhythmias suspected to be related to ginkgo have been reported. Internationally, there are at least 162 reports from 18 countries, with 34% of cases considered serious, involving five deaths and four life-threatening events. Additionally, a report from Canada found that 10 out of 15 cases of arrhythmia were considered serious. Ginkgo was the only suspect ingredient in 57% of all international reports, with symptoms generally presenting within days of initiation. The most common symptoms included palpitations, tachycardia, bradycardia, syncope, and loss of consciousness. Most cases were reported to be related to oral use of ginkgo leaf products; however, some cases were associated with oral use of the seed, and others with intravenous or intramuscular use of the leaf. Documented discontinuation of ginkgo led to recovery in approximately 84% of cases where ginkgo was the sole suspect. Despite these findings, ginkgo cannot be confirmed as the causal agent. It is possible that these reports are confounded by underlying co-morbidities. Of the reported cases, the main reason for ginkgo use was tinnitus, a symptom commonly associated with pre-existing arrhythmias (105253, 105254). Despite this large number of reports, only three cases of cardiac arrhythmia have been published in the literature (105253, 105254). In one case, frequent nocturnal episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were reported for a 35-year-old female taking ginkgo extract 240 mg daily orally for 2 months. Arrythmias ceased following discontinuation of ginkgo (87884).\n\nIncreases in blood pressure were commonly reported with ginkgo in a safety database analysis; however, information on the magnitude of the increase was limited, and reports included both oral and intravenous administration (115628).\n\nIn one clinical trial, the rate of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks was significantly higher in patients taking ginkgo extract orally when compared with placebo (16635). It is unclear if these events were due to ginkgo, other factors, or a combination.\nless\nDermatologic\nTopically, ginkgo fruit pulp can cause contact dermatitis, with intense itching, edema, papules, and pustules which take 7-10 days to resolve after stopping contact (112946).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, ginkgo extract may cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort or pain (3965, 8543, 17112, 87818, 87858), nausea and vomiting (8543, 17112, 87728, 87844, 87858), diarrhea (87844), dry mouth (17112), and constipation (5719, 87787). However, post-market surveillance suggests that the incidence of these events is relatively low, occurring in less than 2% of patients (88007).\n\nFresh ginkgo seeds can cause stomach ache, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Ingesting roasted seeds in amounts larger than the normal food amounts of 8-10 seeds per day, or long-term, can also cause these same adverse reactions (8231, 8232).\nless\nGenitourinary\nOrally, ginkgo extract has been reported to cause blood in the urine (87858, 115628).\nless\nHematologic\nSpontaneous bleeding is one of the most concerning potential side effects associated with ginkgo. There are several published case reports linking ginkgo to episodes of minor to severe bleeding; however, not all case reports clearly establish ginkgo as the cause of bleeding. In most cases, other bleeding risk factors were also present including taking other medications or natural medicines, old age, liver cirrhosis, recent surgery, and other conditions. In most cases, bleeding occurred after several weeks or months of taking ginkgo (13135). Large-scale clinical trials and a meta-analysis evaluating standardized ginkgo leaf extracts show that the incidence of bleeding in patients taking ginkgo is not significantly higher than in those taking placebo (16634, 16635, 17179, 17402).\n\nThere are several case reports of intracerebral bleeding. Some of these cases resulted in permanent neurological damage and one case resulted in death (244, 578, 8581, 13135, 13179, 14456, 87868, 87977).\n\nThere are at least 4 cases of ocular bleeding including spontaneous hyphema (bleeding from the iris into the anterior part of the eye) and retrobulbar hemorrhage associated with ginkgo use (579, 10450, 13135).\n\nThere are also cases of surgical and post-surgical complications in patients using ginkgo. Retrobulbar hemorrhage (bleeding behind the eye) during cataract surgery has been associated with ginkgo use (10450). Excessive postoperative bleeding requiring transfusion has also occurred following laparoscopic surgery in a patient who had been taking ginkgo leaf extract (887). There have also been two cases of excessive bleeding during surgery and post-surgical hematoma in patients undergoing rhytidoplasty and blepharoplasty (13002). In another case, an elderly patient taking ginkgo experienced excessive postoperative bleeding following total hip arthroplasty (13194). In another case, use of ginkgo following liver transplantation surgery was associated with subphrenic hematoma requiring evacuation by laparotomy. The patient also subsequently experienced vitreous hemorrhage (14315). In another case, an elderly patient who had taken ginkgo chronically experienced excessive post-operative bleeding following an ambulatory surgical procedure (14453).\n\nIn another case, an elderly man experienced nose bleeds and ecchymosis following use of ginkgo. One case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in a female taking ginkgo and ginseng for over one year has been reported (95670). These instances of bleeding stopped when ginkgo was discontinued, and recurred when the patient started taking ginkgo again (13135).\n\nPersistent bleeding has also occurred following dental surgery (87862) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (88000). Nosebleed has also been reported as an adverse effect in a clinical trial (87813).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, ginkgo leaf extract can cause allergic skin reactions in some patients (14449, 15578, 112946). In one case, a patient developed acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis 48 hours after taking a single-ingredient ginkgo product. The rash resolved within 10 days after discontinuing ginkgo (14449). In another case, progressive erythema of the face, neck, trunk, and extremities occurred after two 60 mg oral doses of ginkgo extract (112946). There is also a case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome following a second administration of a preparation containing ginkgo leaf extract, choline, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 (208). In another case, systemic edema and severe arthralgia was reported after contact with a ginkgo tree nut and manifested as multifocal lymphadenopathy associated with an allergic reaction on PET/CT scan imaging (95672).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nEdema has been reported for three patients treated with ginkgo extract 40 mg orally three times daily (87818).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, ginkgo extract may cause headache (6220, 8543, 87818), dizziness (5719, 87818), increased desire to sleep (87839, 115628), and sedation (10893) in some patients. In addition, although ginkgo leaf and ginkgo leaf extract contain only small amounts of ginkgotoxin, there are anecdotal reports of seizure occurring after use of ginkgo leaf preparations both in patients without a history of seizure disorder and in those with previously well-controlled epilepsy (7030, 7090, 11296, 14281).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nOrally, ginkgo may cause tinnitus is some patients (8543, 115628).\n\nTopically, eye drops containing ginkgo extract and hyaluronic acid may cause stinging sensations in some people (87829).\nless\nPsychiatric\nOrally, ginkgo has been associated with a single case of mood dysregulation. A 50-year-old female with schizophrenia developed irritability, difficulty controlling anger, and agitation after one week of taking ginkgo 80 mg twice daily. The mood changes resolved within 2-3 days of discontinuation. When ginkgo was re-trialed at a later date, the same symptoms reappeared, and again dissipated after discontinuation of the ginkgo product. The relationship between ginkgo and mood dysregulation was considered to be \"probable\" based on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale (96763); however, the exact mechanism by which ginkgo may have affected mood regulation is unknown.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAnxiety. Oral ginkgo seems to modestly reduce anxiety symptoms.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific ginkgo extract called EGb 761 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) for 4 weeks can modestly reduce symptoms of anxiety in a greater percentage of adults with generalized anxiety disorder or adjustment disorder with anxious mood when compared with placebo. After 4 weeks of treatment, a reduction in anxiety rating score of at least 50% was seen in 44% of patients treated with 480 mg daily, 39% of patients treated with 240 mg daily, and 22% of patients treated with placebo (15578). It is unclear whether these effects would persist when taken for longer than 4 weeks. This study was also included in a meta-analysis that performed indirect comparisons of multiple herbs for the treatment of anxiety. This analysis suggests that taking ginkgo may reduce anxiety scores modestly more than kava (110711). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by the small amount of data available for ginkgo.\nless\nDementia. Oral ginkgo 240 mg seems to improve symptoms of various types of dementia, but lower doses are not always effective. Oral ginkgo does not seem to prevent or slow down the progression of dementia.\nMost evidence shows that higher doses of a specific ginkgo extract (EGb761) modestly improve symptoms of Alzheimer, vascular, or mixed dementias. Meta-analyses of clinical research in patients with dementia show that taking ginkgo, usually 240 mg daily for 22-24 weeks, modestly improves cognition and activities of daily living when compared with placebo. When studies testing low-dose (120 mg) and high-dose (240 mg) ginkgo are pooled together, benefits become inconsistent (87819, 87851, 87855, 87866, 88006, 89713, 102183, 102185, 103572)(111333, 116620). Although most clinical trials show benefit, there are some clinical trials with conflicting findings, suggesting inconsistent and unpredictable effects (16637, 87726).\n\nThere has been some debate about whether ginkgo is more effective in dementia patients who have neuropsychiatric symptoms. Most clinical research shows that this is not the case. However, high-dose ginkgo 240 mg daily seems to modestly relieve most neuropsychiatric symptoms other than psychosis (17717, 87794, 87897, 102185, 102186, 102187).\n\nSome clinical research has evaluated ginkgo in conjunction with prescription medications. A meta-analysis of small, mostly low-quality studies in adults with Alzheimer disease shows that taking ginkgo extract daily in conjunction with donepezil 5-10 mg daily for 4-12 weeks improves the total efficacy rate and cognitive scores when compared with donepezil alone (111332). A meta-analysis of mostly small clinical studies in adults with vascular dementia also shows that taking ginkgo extract orally or intravenously daily for 4-12 weeks, in addition to donepezil, moderately improves cognitive scores and functional scores when compared with donepezil alone (114767). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, which utilized various doses and forms of ginkgo.\n\nClinical studies have also compared ginkgo directly to prescription medications. Some small studies in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease show that taking a specific ginkgo leaf extract (EGb761, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 160-240 mg daily for 22-24 weeks seems to be comparable to donepezil 5-10 mg daily (14499, 87826). Similarly, a clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment shows that taking ginkgo extract 150 mg three times daily for 6 months seems to be comparable to donepezil 5 mg daily for improvement of cognitive scores (106611). However, indirect comparisons suggest that ginkgo leaf extract might be less effective than donepezil, tacrine, rivastigmine, and other cholinesterase inhibitors (6224, 6490, 11981, 89710).\n\nGinkgo does not appear to be beneficial for preventing or slowing the progression of dementia. Epidemiologic research shows that taking ginkgo extract is not associated with a decreased risk of developing dementia in elderly adults with memory impairment (14812). Three large-scale clinical trials also show that taking ginkgo extract 120 mg twice daily does not reduce the risk of developing all-cause dementia or Alzheimer disease in elderly adults with normal cognitive function or in those with mild cognitive impairment (16634, 87848, 87904). In addition, taking ginkgo extract does not seem to prevent disease progression in Alzheimer patients (89713).\n\nMost of the clinical studies on the effectiveness of ginkgo leaf for dementia have used the standardized extracts EGb 761 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals and Ipsen) and LI 1370 (Lichtwer Pharma). These two extracts are similar and prepared to contain approximately 24% to 25% flavone glycosides and 6% terpene lactones. Other products with similar ingredients include Ginkai (Lichtwer Pharma), Ginkgo 5 (Pharmline), Ginkgold and Ginkgo (Nature's Way), and Quanterra Mental Sharpness (Warner-Lambert).\nless\nHearing loss. Intravenous ginkgo appears to improve hearing loss when used in conjunction with corticosteroids. The effectiveness of oral ginkgo is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with sudden hearing loss shows that using intravenous ginkgo leaf extract 40-175 mg daily, in addition to corticosteroids, for 5-14 days increases clinical cure rates by 1.3 times that of corticosteroids alone. Ginkgo leaf in combination with corticosteroids also improved hearing sensitivity (107360). Another meta-analysis of 27 mostly low-quality RCTs in patients with sudden hearing loss, that includes some of the same studies as the prior analysis, shows that adding ginkgo extract to usual care for 1-14 days leads to improvement or no further deterioration in 91% of patients when compared with 75% of patients receiving usual care (111339). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by unclear ginkgo dosing and inclusion of studies that administered ginkgo orally, as an injection, or unknown route. In addition, usual care treatments were not described.\n\nIn addition, one clinical study in patients with short-term idiopathic hearing loss shows that oral ginkgo leaf extract 120 mg twice daily for 8 weeks might improve hearing recovery rates when compared with ginkgo leaf extract 12 mg twice daily (8543). However, there was a high spontaneous recovery rate in both groups, so it is unclear how much benefit, if any, can be attributed to ginkgo leaf extract.\nless\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Oral ginkgo seems to reduce symptoms of PMS.\nTaking ginkgo leaf extract orally 80 mg twice daily or 40 mg three times daily seems to produce significant relief in breast tenderness and other physical and psychological symptoms associated with PMS when started during the 16th day of the menstrual cycle and continued until the 5th day of the following cycle for up to two cycles (6229, 87839). Specific ginkgo leaf extracts that have been assessed for this condition include Ginko T.D. (Tolidaru Pharmaceuticals) and EGb 761, which is an ingredient in several commercial products including Tebonin (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals), Tanakan (Ipsen), and Quanterra Mental Sharpness (Warner-Lambert).\nless\nSchizophrenia. Oral ginkgo seems to reduce total and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and may be beneficial for reducing antipsychotic-associated adverse effects.\nTaking a standardized ginkgo leaf extract EGb 761 (Yi Kang Ning, Yang Zi Jiang Pharmaceuticals Ltd.), 120-360 mg orally daily in addition to standard antipsychotic medications (such as olanzapine, clozapine, or haloperidol) for 8-16 weeks, can reduce total and negative symptoms of schizophrenia when compared to treatment with antipsychotic medications alone (87844, 95901). Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that ginkgo extract at doses of 120-360 mg daily is weakly recommended for adjunctive use in schizophrenia, primarily for negative symptoms (110318).\n\nTreatment with ginkgo leaf extract might also reduce anticholinergic side effects such as thirst and constipation and adverse behavioral, cardiovascular, and nerve symptoms associated with antipsychotic treatment (87708, 95901). Additional clinical research is needed to determine the role of ginkgo on antipsychotic-associated adverse effects.\nless\nStroke. Oral and intravenous ginkgo may modestly improve certain aspects of neurological recovery from both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke; intravenous ginkgo might be more effective.\nWhile some individual studies show conflicting results, meta-analyses of small, low-quality clinical trials in patients recovering from ischemic stroke show that oral or intravenous (IV) ginkgo extract along with conventional therapy seems to improve neurologic function and activities of daily living scores, but not quality of life or the risk of recurrent stroke or death, when compared with conventional therapy alone (14435, 102883, 102884, 107452). However, the overall methodological quality of the meta-analyses is low, with a high risk of bias (113783). One meta-analysis shows that IV ginkgo extract is associated with greater improvements in these measures than oral ginkgo extract (102884).\n\nMost studies of IV ginkgo for acute ischemic stroke have utilized a specific derivative called ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine (GDLM), which is comprised of the active ingredients ginkgolides A, B, and K. One meta-analysis shows that combination therapy with GDLM and tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA), a thrombolytic, is associated with greater improvements than conventional treatments alone or other traditional Chinese herbal medicines that contain ginkgo (i.e. ginaton, danhong, xueshuantong, and shuxuening injections). This specific formulation also appears to be more effective than IV ginkgolides or ginkgolide B; however, investigators did not provide a statistical comparison of outcomes between groups, limiting the validity of this finding (108610). Another meta-analysis shows that a combination IV preparation of ginkgo leaf extract plus dipyridamole, given as 10-40 mL daily for 14-30 days along with conventional therapy, also improves neurologic function and activities of daily living when compared with conventional therapy alone (102882).\n\nIn adults with mild to severe ischemic stroke not treated with thrombolytics, a multi-center clinical trial of more than 3000 patients in China shows that administering intravenous GDLM 25 mg daily for 14 days modestly increases the number of patients with an excellent (0-1) modified Rankin score (mRS) at 90 days to 51%, compared to 44% of those in the placebo group (111693). A post-hoc analysis of this study also identified a modest improvement in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score with the use of GDLM; 75% of patients in the treatment group had at least a minimum 2-point improvement in score at 90 days, compared with 71% of those receiving placebo (113784). About 90% of the people in this study received antiplatelet medicine, about 60% received a lipid-lowering medicine, and about 42% received an antihypertensive; these rates were similar between groups (111693, 113784). A meta-analysis that pooled this large study with several smaller, lower-quality clinical studies in China also shows that administering this GDLM regimen in conjunction with conventional treatments increases the relative likelihood of achieving an excellent (mRS score 0 -1) or favorable (mRS 0-2) functional outcome by 16% and 21%, respectively, when compared with placebo and conventional treatment alone (116621).\n\nIn adults with hemorrhagic stroke, preliminary clinical research shows that IV ginkgo extract (Taiwan Jisheng Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 17.5 grams daily for 2 weeks, in conjunction with routine treatment and IV oxiracetam 6 grams, reduces cerebral edema and bleeding and modestly improves recovery of neurological and cognitive function and activities of daily living when compared with oxiracetam plus routine care or routine care alone (103573). A meta-analysis of 19 clinical studies in adults in China with hemorrhagic stroke shows that treatment with ginkgo leaf extracts for 7-20 days in combination with standard treatment is associated with lower NIH and Chinese stroke scale scores, lower residual hematoma and cerebral edema volumes, and higher cognitive function and activity of daily living scores when compared with standard treatment alone. However, the validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity in the results (113781).\nless\nTardive dyskinesia. Oral ginkgo seems to reduce the severity of tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenic patients being treated with antipsychotic medications.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific ginkgo extract called EGb 761 (Yi Kang Ning, Yang Zi Jiang Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) 80 mg three times daily for 12 weeks can reduce the severity of tardive dyskinesia by at least 30% when compared with placebo in schizophrenic patients being treated with antipsychotic medications (87864).\nless\nVascular dementia. Oral ginkgo extract seems to modestly improve scores related to cognitive function in patients with this condition.\nA meta-analysis of small randomized controlled trials in adults with vascular dementia shows that taking ginkgo extract orally or intravenously daily for 4-12 weeks, in addition to donepezil, moderately improves cognitive scores and functional scores when compared with donepezil alone (114767). However, the results of this study are limited by high heterogeneity. In addition, these trials do not report standard doses of ginkgo.\n\nA small clinical study in patients with vascular dementia shows that taking a specific extract of ginkgo EGb 761 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 240 mg daily for 24 weeks modestly improves scores related to cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and activities of daily living when compared with placebo (17191). A preliminary open-label clinical study in patients aged 50 years or older in China shows that taking the same ginkgo extract 240 mg daily for 24 weeks, starting within 7-14 days after an ischemic stroke, modestly improves scores related to cognitive function and mental health, but not neuropsychiatric symptoms, when compared with standard care (111335). However, the patients in this study had minor strokes; these results may not apply to patients with more severe strokes.\n\nGinkgo has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients to treat vascular dementia. A small clinical study in patients aged 60 years or older with vascular dementia shows that taking a supplement containing extracts of ginkgo, Panax ginseng, and saffron 60 mg three times daily for 16 weeks modestly improves some cognitive function scores, caregiver assessed activities of daily living, and patient-reported quality of life. However, these effects were not maintained after patients stopped taking the supplement (111336).\nless\nVertigo. Oral ginkgo seems to improve symptoms of vertigo in people with vestibular disorders. It is unclear if it is beneficial for vertigo caused by cerebral arteriosclerosis.\nTaking ginkgo leaf extract 120-160 mg daily orally seems to improve symptoms of vertigo and equilibrium disorders (5721, 6220, 6221, 107359, 108608). There is evidence from two clinical studies that ginkgo leaf extract (EGb 761) for 3 months is significantly more effective than placebo (6220), and possibly as effective as betahistine, for improving vertigo and dizziness caused by vascular vestibular disorders and vestibular disorders of unknown origin (6220, 6221). However, adding balance training to treatment with ginkgo leaf extract (EGb 761) orally 80 mg twice daily for 3 months is no better than taking ginkgo leaf extract alone (107359).\n\nGinkgo has also been evaluated in patients with vertigo caused by mild cerebral arteriosclerosis. A clinical study in this population shows that taking oral ginkgo leaf extract (Zhejiang Jiu Xu Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd) 40 mg three times daily for 6 weeks improves scores of traditional Chinese medicine symptom pattern, specifically dizziness, blurry vision, headache, and amnesia, but does not impact Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores, when compared with naoxinqing (NXQ), a standardized herbal product that contains Japanese persimmon leaf extract (108608). The validity of this study is limited due to the lack of comparison to placebo or an accepted conventional treatment.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAge-related cognitive decline. Most research shows that oral ginkgo does not improve symptoms of age-related cognitive impairment.\nWhile some preliminary clinical research shows a modest benefit of ginkgo leaf extract on memory and cognitive function in patients with age-related memory or thinking impairment (5717, 6216, 89712), most clinical research shows that taking ginkgo leaf extract orally does not improve memory or attention in elderly individuals with normal mental function (5718, 8586, 8587, 8588, 87848).\n\nClinical research also shows that taking a standardized ginkgo leaf extract (Thorne Research Inc.) 240 mg daily for 3.5 years does not reduce the risk of developing age-related cognitive impairment in elderly patients aged 85 years and older who have normal cognitive function (16635).\nless\nAntidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction. Most research shows that oral ginkgo does not improve symptoms of sexual dysfunction in people using antidepressants.\nAlthough some preliminary clinical research shows that taking ginkgo leaf extract orally might help sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressant therapy (3965, 3967), subsequent research indicates that it not likely to be beneficial (207, 3966, 3969, 10893, 14383).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral ginkgo does not seem to prevent CVD.\nA large-scale randomized trial shows that taking a specific ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 240 mg daily orally for an average of 6.1 years does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, CVD-related hospitalization, or mortality in elderly patients when compared with placebo (17402).\nless\nChemotherapy-related cognitive impairment. Oral ginkgo does not seem to improve symptoms of cognitive impairment in people using chemotherapy.\nClinical research shows that taking a specific ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 60 mg twice daily, starting prior to the second cycle of chemotherapy and continuing until one month after chemotherapy completion, does not prevent chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction when compared with placebo in chemotherapy-naïve breast cancer patients (89701).\nless\nHypertension. Oral ginkgo does not seem to reduce blood pressure in older, hypertensive patients.\nA meta-analysis of low-quality research in subjects with hypertension shows that taking ginkgo orally daily for 4-26 weeks modestly improves systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with control (114766). However, the validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity, differing co-interventions, including known antihypertensives, and differing controls. Other clinical research shows that taking a standardized ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 240 mg daily for up to 6 years does not reduce blood pressure when compared with placebo in hypertensive patients aged 75 years or older (87853).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). Most research shows that oral ginkgo does not improve symptoms of MS.\nMost clinical research shows that taking ginkgo leaf extract or ginkgolide B, a constituent of ginkgo leaf extract, does not improve cognition or disability in patients with MS (87739, 87787, 87903, 87947). However, a single preliminary clinical study shows that taking a standardized ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) may improve processing speed when compared with placebo in patients with multiple sclerosis (89705).\nless\nTinnitus. Most research shows that oral ginkgo does not improve symptoms of tinnitus.\nTaking ginkgo leaf extract orally does not seem to improve symptoms of tinnitus. Although some studies have shown benefit, the majority of the clinical evidence indicates that ginkgo leaf extract is not consistently effective for patients with tinnitus (221, 910, 5721, 6218, 6219, 9871, 87754, 87901, 110093, 111337)(111513).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial in AMD.\nPreliminary clinical research suggests that taking a specific ginkgo leaf extract (EGb 761) 60-240 mg orally in divided doses for up to 6 months might improve symptoms of AMD (6227, 6228, 11797). There is limited evidence that ginkgo leaf extract might significantly improve distance vision in patients with AMD (6227).\nless\nAging. Although there has been interest in using oral ginkgo for aging, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginkgo for this condition.\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Topical ginkgo has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis shows that applying two drops of specific eye drops (Trium, SOOFT) containing ginkgo extract 0.05% and hyaluronic acid 0.15%, three times daily for one month can decrease redness by 80%, discharge by 40%, and swelling by 10% when compared to using eye drops with hyaluronic acid alone (87829).\nless\nAltitude sickness. Research on the use of oral ginkgo for altitude sickness is conflicting.\nSome research shows that taking ginkgo extract 80-120 mg twice daily for 4 days before the ascent to an altitude of 4300-5400 meters significantly reduces the occurrence of symptoms of acute altitude sickness, including headache, fatigue, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting, when compared with placebo (6230, 87827). A standardized ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761, 160 mg in two divided doses daily, was used in one of these studies (6230). However, a large-scale trial using a different ginkgo extract (GK501, Pharmaton Natural Health Products) 120 mg twice daily for 1-2 days before the climb from an altitude of 4280 meters to 4928 meters, shows that ginkgo extract has no effect on preventing altitude sickness (11766). Also, another small study suggests that taking ginkgo extract 120 mg twice daily for 3 days before an ascent does not reduce altitude sickness when compared with placebo (87827). The conflicting results may be due to differences in starting baseline altitudes before ascent, duration of the pre-treatment period, or the source of the ginkgo product.\nless\nAngina. Some low-quality evidence suggests that oral ginkgo may reduce angina symptoms when taken in addition to standard of care.\nA large meta-analysis of variable-quality studies in patients with unstable angina shows that taking ginkgo orally or intravenously for up to 12 weeks modestly improves angina symptoms when compared with control (114768). However, the results of this study are limited by the heterogeneity of included studies, including different control treatments. A small clinical study in patients with stable angina shows that taking ginkgo extract formulated with a polyethylene glycol matrix to improve bioavailability, 315 mg three times daily with standard therapy for 12 weeks, does not improve the overall Seattle Angina Questionnaire score when compared with placebo, although there is a trend towards a reduction in angina attack frequency (113782).\nless\nAsthma. Oral ginkgo has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that a taking two capsules of a specific combination product (AKL1, AKL International Ltd.) containing ginkgo extract 130 mg/capsule, ginger 100 mg/capsule, and Picrorhiza 270 mg/capsule twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve lung function, respiratory symptoms, or quality of life when compared with placebo in adult patients with asthma (87786).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial in ADHD.\nOne clinical study shows that taking a standardized ginkgo extract (Ginko T.D., Tolidaru Pharmaceuticals) 80-120 mg daily for 6 weeks is less effective than methylphenidate 20-30 mg daily in children aged 6-14 years with newly diagnosed ADHD. Only 8% of children taking ginkgo extract had at least a 40% improvement in a teacher/parent ADHD rating scale, compared with 64% in children taking methylphenidate (17112). Another clinical study in children aged 6-12 years with ADHD shows that taking the same standardized ginkgo extract 80-120 mg daily in combination with methylphenidate 20-40 mg daily for 6 weeks does not improve parent- or teacher-rated ADHD scores by a clinically meaningful amount when compared with methylphenidate alone (95669). However, one preliminary clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product (AD-fX, CV Technologies) containing ginkgo leaf extract 100 mg, in combination with American ginseng extract 400 mg, in two divided doses for 4 weeks might significantly improve ADHD symptoms such as anxiety, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in children aged 3-17 years (8235).\n\nGuidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that ginkgo extract at doses of 80-120 mg daily is not currently recommended for monotherapy or adjunctive use in children with ADHD due to mixed evidence (110318).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial in children with autism.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking a specific ginkgo extract (Ginko T.D., Tolidaru Pharmaceuticals) 80-120 mg daily for 10 weeks along with risperidone 1-3 mg daily does not improve symptoms of autism when compared with risperidone alone in children aged 4-12 years (89708).\nless\nBronchitis. Although there has been interest in using oral ginkgo for bronchitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginkgo for this condition.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Oral ginkgo has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with CFS shows that taking ginkgo leaf 120-180 mg in combination with Cistanche tubulosa root 300-450 mg orally daily for 60 days improves fatigue scores by 16% to 19% when compared with placebo. Taking this combination also improved quality of life scores when compared with placebo (107361).\nless\nChronic kidney disease (CKD). There is limited evidence on the intravenous use of ginkgo leaf extract in adults with hypertensive nephropathy. It has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small meta-analysis in patients with hypertensive nephropathy shows that intravenous administration of 20-30 mL of ginkgo leaf extract and dipyridamole injection once daily for 3-4 weeks along with conventional antihypertensive therapy improves levels of 24-hour urinary total protein, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen by 0.6 grams/dL, 33 mg/dL, and 7 mg/dL, respectively (106610). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginkgo, dipyridamole, or the combination.\nless\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral ginkgo has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (AKL1, AKL International Ltd.) containing ginkgo extract, ginger, and Picrorhiza twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve respiratory symptoms when compared with placebo in patients with COPD (89702).\nless\nCocaine dependence. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial for maintenance of abstinence from cocaine.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking a standardized ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761 in a dose of 120 mg twice daily for 10 weeks does not help maintain abstinence from cocaine use when compared with placebo in cocaine-dependent patients (87723).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial for cognitive function.\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that taking ginkgo leaf extract daily for up to 12 weeks might improve some measures of cognitive function, such as working and long term memory, attention based tasks, speed of information processing, executive function, immediate and delayed recall, and recognition (6214, 6215, 8236, 8544, 8585, 8588, 9759, 16635, 87788, 87879, 95668). Doses used in these studies include single doses of ginkgo extract 240-600 mg (6215, 8236), a standardized ginkgo extract called EGb 761, 120-240 mg taken once daily or in 2-3 divided doses daily for 4-24 weeks (5717, 6216, 8585, 8588, 87879, 95668), or another specific ginkgo extract called LI 1370 (Lichtwer Pharma), 120-300 mg daily in three divided doses for 2 days (6214). However, other clinical studies and one clinical review show no significant effect of ginkgo on gait ability, attention, memory, or executive function regardless of participant age, dose, or formulation used (87907, 5718, 8586, 8587, 8588, 87907, 95667). Due to the small number of study participants, significant differences in baseline cognitive function between groups, and variability in outcome measures, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Larger scale studies are needed to determine the effect of ginkgo on cognitive function in healthy individuals.\n\nThere is also conflicting evidence about the effect of ginkgo on cognitive function when taken in combination with other products. Some research suggests that taking ginkgo in combination with Panax ginseng or codonopsis enhances memory in healthy young or middle-aged adults, and the combinations might be more effective than the individual products (8591, 9759, 87758). These studies have used a specific combination product (Ginkoba M/E, Pharmaton SA) containing ginkgo extract 100-600 mg and Panax ginseng 60-360 mg, taken as a single dose or once daily for 12 weeks (8591, 9759) or two capsules of a product containing ginkgo extract 40 mg/capsule and Codonopsis 75 mg/capsule daily (87758). However, other clinical research shows that taking ginkgo combined with Panax ginseng (Gincosan, Pharmaton Natural Health Products) or bacopa extract (Ginkgo Brahmi, Blackmore's Ltd.) for up to 12 weeks does not improve cognition when compared with placebo in healthy adults (87767, 87748). Similarly, a moderate-sized clinical study in healthy adults aged 40-65 years shows that taking a supplement containing ginkgo leaf, bacopa, and B vitamins twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve memory or attention when compared with placebo (111334).\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if ginkgo is beneficial for cognitive impairment.\nA clinical study of 500 patients with mild cognitive impairment that is abnormal for their age shows that taking a specific ginkgo standardized extract (EGb761, Tanakan) 40 mg three times daily for 24 months improves scores for cognitive decline, memory, activities of daily living, and depression when compared with baseline (105530). However, it is not clear if these improvements are clinically significant and the validity of the study is limited by the lack of a control group.\n\nCognitive impairment is common side effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). A small clinical study in patients aged 18-60 years with psychiatric disorders undergoing ECT in Iran shows that taking ginkgo (Vitarmonil Co., France) 200 mg after meals, starting 48 hours before initiation of ECT and continuing until the end of ECT sessions, modestly improves scores related to cognitive impairment and memory when compared with placebo (111338). However, it is unclear if these improvements are clinically significant.\nless\nColorectal cancer. Intravenous ginkgo has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that adding intravenous ginkgo extract (EGb 761 ONC), 350 mg over 30 minutes on days 1-6 of every 3-week cycle to treatment with 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 daily on days 2-6 of every 3-week cycle for 4 courses of treatment, might reduce disease progression in some patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (9872). However, since the study did not include a control group, it is unclear if the effects of treatment were greater than the effects of 5-fluorouracil alone.\nless\nCough. Although there has been interest in using oral ginkgo for cough, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginkgo for this condition.\nDepression. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial in depression.\nPreliminary clinical research in elderly patients shows that taking an unknown dose of a specific ginkgo extract (Harbin HaoBo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) in conjunction with citalopram 20 mg daily for 12 weeks improves depression scores by 75% or more in an additional 3% of patients when compared with taking citalopram alone. Taking ginkgo extract with citalopram also produces a faster onset of action when compared to taking citalopram alone. However, it is not clear if these improvements are clinically significant (98811). A meta-analysis of 21 mainly Chinese studies shows that adding ginkgo preparations in various doses to conventional treatment for depression improves Hamilton Depression Scale scores and increases serotonin levels when compared with conventional treatment alone, but there is high heterogeneity in the results (113779).\nless\nDiabetes. Research on the use of oral ginkgo in type 2 diabetes is conflicting.\nIn patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes taking metformin, preliminary clinical research shows that taking ginkgo extract (EGb 761) 120 mg for 90 days reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from an average of 8.6% at baseline to an average of 7.7%. Fasting serum glucose and insulin were also reduced, when compared with baseline, by approximately 20% and 28%, respectively (103574). However, a meta-analysis of 7 clinical studies shows that taking ginkgo is associated with an increase in HbA1c levels, with no effect on fasting serum glucose levels. The only beneficial effect identified in this analysis was an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (105529). Another meta-analysis of mainly Chinese studies, shows that adding various ginkgo preparations to metformin for 1-3 years does not improve fasting serum glucose, HbA1c, or cholesterol levels, but does reduce blood viscosity and hematocrit while improving dorsalis pedis artery blood flow and ankle brachial index, suggesting a beneficial effect on peripheral arterial disease associated with diabetes (113780).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial for this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761 120 mg daily orally for 6 months improves measures of color vision when compared with placebo in patients with early diabetic retinopathy (6175).\nless\nDry eye. Ginkgo eye drops have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA nonblinded clinical study in adults undergoing cataract surgery and receiving standard treatment shows that applying a specific, preservative-free eye drop (Trium Free; SOOFT) containing ginkgo extract 0.05% and hyaluronic acid 0.15%, three times daily, beginning the first day after surgery and continued for 4 weeks, reduces dry eye severity and symptoms when compared with standard treatment alone. After 4 weeks, 50% of patients in the standard treatment group reported dry eye symptoms, compared with 16% of patients using ginkgo (108609). The effects of ginkgo in patients with chronic dry eye or dry eye caused by other factors is unclear.\nless\nDyslexia. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial for dyslexia in children.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a standardized ginkgo leaf extract (EGb 761) 80 mg daily for an average of 34 days can help reduce dyslexia when compared to baseline in children aged 5-16 years (87790). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nFibromyalgia. Oral ginkgo has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking tablets containing ginkgo extract (Bio-Biloba, Pharma Nord) 200 mg daily in conjunction with capsules containing coenzyme Q10 (Bio Quinone Q10, Pharma Nord) 200 mg daily orally for 84 days improves patient-reported quality of life, such as physical fitness levels, emotional feelings, social activities, overall health, and pain, when compared to baseline (17716). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nGastric cancer. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial in gastric cancer.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking carbohydrates from the outer layer of ginkgo fruit 250 mg orally twice daily for 30 days may reduce tumor size in patients with gastric cancer when compared with pre-treatment (87742).\nless\nGlaucoma. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial in glaucoma.\nA small observational study has found that taking ginkgo leaf extract 80 mg twice daily for up to 12.3 years is associated with reduced progression of visual field damage in patients with normal tension glaucoma (87900). Furthermore, a small clinical study in patients with normal tension glaucoma shows that taking ginkgo leaf extract 40 mg three times daily for up 4 weeks might improve pre-existing damage and reduce the progression of damage to the visual field (10378). Another small study in patients with newly diagnosed normal tension glaucoma shows that taking a specific ginkgo extract (Ginaton, Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 40 mg three times daily for 4 weeks does not improve damage or progression of glaucoma (89707). Reasons for the discrepancies may be due to the formulation of ginkgo leaf extract used, duration of treatment, inclusion of healthy participants, or the severity of glaucoma at baseline.\nless\nHemorrhoids. Oral ginkgo has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking a combination of ginkgo extract, troxerutin, and heptaminol for one week may decrease some symptoms of hemorrhoids, including bleeding, pain, feelings of incomplete defecation, and discharge when compared to baseline (87751). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to ginkgo, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Although there has been interest in using oral ginkgo for hypercholesterolemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginkgo for this condition.\nIntestinal parasite infection. Although there has been interest in using oral ginkgo for intestinal parasite infection, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginkgo for this condition.\nLyme disease. Although there has been interest in using oral ginkgo for cognitive dysfunction associated with Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginkgo for this condition.\nMigraine headache. Oral ginkgolide B, a constituent of ginkgo biloba extract, has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that ginkgolide B (BN52021), a constituent of ginkgo extract, along with coenzyme Q10, riboflavin, and magnesium, taken twice daily for 3 months, may help prevent migraines in school-aged children when compared to baseline (44181, 87876). Also, a specific product (Migrasoll, Pharmaval Srl) containing ginkgolide B 60 mg, coenzyme Q10 11 mg, and vitamin B2 8.7 mg, taken twice daily for 4 months, may help prevent migraines in females when compared to baseline (44103). The validity of the findings from these studies is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nOvarian cancer. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial in preventing ovarian cancer.\nEpidemiological evidence found that use of ginkgo extract for 6 months is associated with a decreased risk for developing ovarian cancer (14813).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. Intravenous ginkgo has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that adding a specific intravenous ginkgo extract called EGb 761 ONC 350 mg on days 1-6 of every 3-week cycle to treatment with 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 daily on days 2-6 of every 3-week cycle until disease progression might slow the progression of pancreatic cancer in some patients (87699). However, since the study did not include a control group, it is unclear if the effects of treatment were greater than the effects of 5-fluorouracil alone.\nless\nParkinson disease. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial for drug-induced Parkinsonism.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with psychiatric diagnoses treated with antipsychotic drugs shows that taking dried ginkgo extract, 80 mg three times daily orally for 3 months, reduces resting tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and the severity of motor symptoms when compared with placebo (112945).\nless\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial in PAD.\nSome small clinical studies show that taking a specific ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals and Ipsen) orally increases pain-free walking distance in patients with Fontaine's IIb peripheral arterial occlusive disease and intermittent claudication and might decrease overall peripheral vascular disease (PVD) event incidence, such as surgery or amputation, in elderly patients (3461, 6211, 6212, 6213, 17402). Significant benefit has been found with doses as low as 120-160 mg daily (6211). However, there is some evidence that a higher dose of 240 mg daily might be more beneficial in some patients (3461, 6212).\n\nAlthough some research is positive, other research shows that taking a specific ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761 (Dr. Willmar Schwabe Pharmaceuticals) 300 mg daily for 16 weeks does not significantly improve maximum treadmill walking time when compared with placebo in patients with PAD (16638). A reason for this discrepancy may be due to the duration of treatment. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking ginkgo leaf extract does not improve maximum treadmill walking distance when compared with placebo in patients with Fontaine stage II PVD and intermittent claudication when administered for 6-8 weeks or 12-16 weeks, but does increase maximum treadmill walking distance by about 85 meters when administered for at least 24 weeks (89440).\nless\nPulmonary hypertension. It is unclear if intravenous ginkgo is beneficial in patients with pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale.\nA meta-analysis of 28 small, low-quality clinical trials, including nearly 2500 Chinese patients with pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, shows that intravenous administration of ginkgo leaf extract plus dipyridamole 15-40 mL daily for 1-4 weeks along with conventional therapy increases the total effective rate by 28% and improves various blood gas measures when compared with conventional therapy alone (102881). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginkgo, dipyridamole, or the combination. Large, high-quality clinical trials are needed to confirm these results.\nless\nQuality of life. Some preliminary clinical studies suggest that oral ginkgo might improve quality of life in elderly individuals.\nA large survey-based study shows that taking a standardized ginkgo leaf extract called LI 1370 (Lichtwer Pharma) 120 mg daily for 4-10 months may improve quality of life measures such as activities of daily living, mood, sleep, and alertness in elderly individuals when compared with control (87715, 87760).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. Topical ginkgo has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific cream product (Radioskin 2, Herbalab di Perazza Massimiliano Company) containing ginkgo extract, Aloe vera, and metal esculetina, along with another specific cream product (Radioskin 1) containing alga atlantica and ethylbisiminomethylguaicolo manganese cloruro, may improve skin hydration and reduce skin toxicity associated with radiation therapy in patients with breast cancer (89727). The creams were applied topically 2-3 times daily at least 3 hours before and after radiation treatment from 15 days prior to radiation until one month after completion. It is unclear if these effects are due to ginkgo, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRadiation exposure. It is unclear if intravenous ginkgo is beneficial in people who have been exposed to radiation.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a standardized ginkgo leaf extract called EGb 761 (Tanakan, Ipsen) 120 mg daily for 2 months might reduce clastogenic factors in the blood of patients who had previously been irradiated. The reduction in clastogenic factors was observed for at least 7 months after initiation of ginkgo in most patients (17719).\nless\nRaynaud syndrome. Evidence for the use of oral ginkgo for flare reduction is conflicting.\nSome research shows that taking a standardized ginkgo extract (Seredrin, Health Perception Ltd.) 120 mg orally three times daily for 10 weeks can decrease the number of painful attacks per week in patients with Raynaud syndrome (11363). However, other research shows that ginkgo extract is no different than placebo in decreasing the number of attacks in these patients (87888). Also, another study shows that taking ginkgo extract 120 mg daily is less effective than nifedipine SR 30 mg daily orally in decreasing Raynaud syndrome flares (87818).\nless\nScabies.

It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial for SAD.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking ginkgo leaf extract orally does not seem to prevent winter depression symptoms in patients with SAD when compared with placebo (8233).\nless\nSexual dysfunction. It is unclear if oral ginkgo is beneficial for sexual dysfunction in females.\nSome clinical research shows that taking a ginkgo leaf extract 300 mg daily for 8 weeks does not significantly improve sexual function in females with sexual arousal disorder when compared with placebo (16640). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (ArginMax for Women, Daily Wellness Company) containing ginkgo leaf extract, Panax ginseng root extract, damiana leaf extract, L-arginine, multivitamins, and minerals for 4 weeks can improve sexual satisfaction when compared with placebo in females who self-report sexual dysfunction (46933).

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nGinkgo extract is sometimes standardized to flavone glycoside and terpene lactone content. Concentrations have ranged from 22% to 27% flavone glycosides and 5% to 7% terpene lactones, which include 2.8% to 3.4% ginkgolides A, B, and C, and 2.6% to 5% bilobalide (221, 6175, 6224, 10378, 11766, 15578, 16638, 16640, 17402, 87794)(87823, 87826, 87839, 87848, 87855, 87879, 87897, 87901, 87904, 88006)(89705).\nIntravenous/Intramuscular:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nOphthalmic:Research is limited; typical dosing information is unavailable.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn general, ginkgo extracts are standardized to flavone glycoside and terpene lactone content. One standardized ginkgo extract called EGb 761, which has been used in a number of clinical trials, is standardized to contain 22% to 27% flavone glycosides and 5% to 7% terpene lactones, which include 2.8% to 3.4% ginkgolides A, B, and C and 2.6% to 3.2% bilobalide (6175, 6224, 15578, 16638, 16640, 17402, 87794, 87823, 87826, 87848)(87855, 87879, 87897, 87901, 87904, 88006, 89705, 107359, 112946). Another standardized ginkgo extract called LI 1370 has been standardized to contain 25% flavone glycosides, 3% ginkgolides, and 5% bilobalide (221). Some ginkgo leaf extract products, including Ginko T.D. (Tolidaru Pharmaceuticals) and GK501 (Pharmaton), are standardized to contain 24% flavone glycosides and 6% terpene lactones (10378, 11766, 87839). The standardized extract of ginkgo used in studies by the National Toxicology Program of the US Department of Health and Human Services contains 31.2% terpene lactones, and 31.2% flavone glycosides (112946).\n\nSome crude extracts from ginkgo leaves contain the constituent ginkgolic acid. This constituent can have strong allergenic properties and might have possible mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. Standardized ginkgo leaf extracts such as EGb 761 contain no greater than 5 ppm in concentration of ginkgolic acids (5714, 8584, 112946). The standardized extract of ginkgo used in studies by the National Toxicology Program of the US Department of Health and Human Services contains 10.45 ppm ginkgolic acids (112946). In isolated cases, ginkgo has been contaminated with colchicine (8541). However, follow-up studies have indicated that this contamination is not widespread (8542).\n\nOn the other hand, contamination of ginkgo with rutin and quercetin is a common practice. Poor quality ginkgo extracts seem satisfactory to buyers and regulatory authorities when they are adulterated with rutin and quercetin from cheaper sources. Only certain types of tests such as UV spectra with SIMCA, Hotelling T2 and Q-residuals, can identify adulterated ginkgo supplements. Other tests, such as near-IR (NIR) spectrometry, do not effectively distinguish between adulterated and authentic ginkgo products (100857, 100858). In a sample of 35 ginkgo supplements sold in health food stores, supermarkets, and pharmacies, 33 were found to contain low levels of ginkgo constituents and/or elevated levels of rutin and quercetin. One product contained an ingredient that is not naturally in ginkgo, a 5-hydroxytryptophan derivative (100857). In another sample of 18 commercial ginkgo products, it was shown that four were adulterated with quercetin, three with rutin, and one with a flavonol glycoside that could not be identified (100858).",

However, ginkgo does not appear to decrease the elimination half-life of alprazolam. This suggests that ginkgo is more likely to decrease absorption of alprazolam rather than induce hepatic metabolism of alprazolam (11029).\nless\nANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nA (High-quality meta-analysis (quantitative systematic review))\nGinkgo has been shown to increase the risk of bleeding in some people when taken with warfarin. Theoretically, ginkgo might increase the risk of bleeding if used with other anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs.\nSeveral pharmacodynamic studies suggest that ginkgo inhibits platelet aggregation. It is thought that the ginkgo constituent, ginkgolide B, displaces platelet-activating factor (PAF) from its binding sites, decreasing blood coagulation (6048, 9760). Several case reports have documented serious bleeding events in patients taking ginkgo (244, 578, 579, 8581, 13002, 13135, 13179, 13194, 14456, 87868). However, population and clinical studies have produced mixed results. Some evidence shows that short-term use of ginkgo leaf does not significantly reduce platelet aggregation and blood clotting (87732). A study in healthy males who took a specific ginkgo leaf extract (EGb 761) 160 mg twice daily for 7 days found no change in prothrombin time (12114). An analysis of a large medical record database suggests that ginkgo increases the risk of a bleeding adverse event by 38% when taken concurrently with warfarin (91326). It has been suggested that ginkgo has to be taken for at least 2-3 weeks to have a significant effect on platelet aggregation (14811). However, a meta-analysis of 18 studies using standardized ginkgo extracts, 80-480 mg daily for up to 32 weeks, did not find a significant effect on platelet aggregation, fibrinogen concentration, or PT/aPTT (17179). In addition, a single dose of ginkgo plus clopidogrel (14811) or ticlopidine does not seem to significantly increase bleeding time or platelet aggregation (17111, 87846). Also, taking ginkgo leaf extract daily for 8 days in conjunction with rivaroxaban does not affect anti-factor Xa activity; however, this study did not evaluate bleeding time (109526).\nless\nANTICONVULSANTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, ginkgo might reduce the effectiveness of anticonvulsants.\nGinkgo seeds contain ginkgotoxin. Large amounts of ginkgotoxin can cause neurotoxicity and seizure. Ginkgotoxin is present in much larger amounts in ginkgo seeds than leaves (8232). Ginkgo leaf extract contains trace amounts of ginkgotoxin. The amount of ginkgotoxin in ginkgo leaf and leaf extract seems unlikely to cause toxicity (11296). However, there are anecdotal reports of seizure occurring after use of ginkgo leaf both in patients without a history of seizure disorder and in those with previously well-controlled epilepsy (7030, 7090).\nless\nANTIDIABETES DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, taking ginkgo with antidiabetes drugs might alter the response to antidiabetes drugs.\nGinkgo leaf extract seems to alter insulin secretion and metabolism, and might affect blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes (5719, 14448, 103574). The effect of ginkgo seems to differ depending on the insulin and treatment status of the patient. In diet-controlled diabetes patients with hyperinsulinemia, taking ginkgo does not seem to significantly affect insulin or blood glucose levels. In patients with hyperinsulinemia who are treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, taking ginkgo seems to decrease insulin levels and increase blood glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test. Researchers speculate that this could be due to ginkgo-enhanced hepatic metabolism of insulin. In patients with pancreatic exhaustion, taking ginkgo seems to stimulate pancreatic beta-cells, resulting in increased insulin and C-peptide levels, but with no significant change in blood glucose levels in response to an oral glucose tolerance test (14448).\nless\nATORVASTATIN (Lipitor)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, ginkgo might decrease the levels and clinical effects of atorvastatin.\nIn humans, intake of ginkgo extract appears to increase atorvastatin clearance, reducing the area under the curve of atorvastatin by 10% to 14% and the maximum concentration by 29%. However, this interaction does not appear to affect cholesterol synthesis and absorption (89706). Further, a model in rats with hyperlipidemia suggests that administering ginkgo extract does not impact blood levels of atorvastatin and leads to lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with rats given atorvastatin alone (111331).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, ginkgo might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2.\nLaboratory research suggests that ginkgo leaf extract can mildly inhibit CYP1A2 enzymes (1303, 6423, 6450). However, clinical research suggests ginkgo might not affect CYP1A2 (10847). Until more is known, use ginkgo cautiously in patients taking drugs metabolized by these enzymes.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, ginkgo might decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\nSome clinical research shows that a specific ginkgo leaf extract (Remembrance, Herbs Product LTD) 140 mg twice daily can induce CYP2C19 enzymes and potentially decrease levels of drugs metabolized by these enzymes (13108). However, other clinical research shows that taking ginkgo 120 mg twice daily for 12 days has no effect on levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 (87824).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, ginkgo might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C9.\nIn vitro, a specific standardized extract of ginkgo leaf (EGb 761) inhibits CYP2C9 activity (11026, 12061, 14337). The terpenoid (ginkgolides) and flavonoid (quercetin, kaempferol, etc.) constituents seem to be responsible for this effect. Most ginkgo extracts contain some amount of these constituents. Therefore, other ginkgo leaf extracts might also inhibit the CYP2C9 enzyme. However, clinical research suggests that ginkgo might not have a significant effect on CYP2C9 in humans. Ginkgo does not seem to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 substrates diclofenac or tolbutamide.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, ginkgo might decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.\nThere is conflicting evidence about whether ginkgo induces or inhibits CYP3A4 (1303, 6423, 6450, 11026, 87800, 87805, 111330). Ginkgo does not appear to affect hepatic CYP3A4 (11029). However, it is not known if ginkgo affects intestinal CYP3A4. Preliminary clinical research suggests that taking ginkgo does not significantly affect levels of donepezil, lopinavir, or ritonavir, which are all CYP3A4 substrates (11027, 87800, 93578). Other clinical research also suggests ginkgo does not significantly affect CYP3A4 activity (10847). However, there are two case reports of decreased efavirenz concentrations and increased viral load in patients taking ginkgo. It is suspected that terpenoids from the ginkgo extract reduced drug levels by inducing cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (16821, 25464).\nless\nEFAVIRENZ (Sustiva)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, ginkgo might decrease the levels and clinical effects of efavirenz.\nThere are two case reports of decreased efavirenz concentrations and increased viral load in patients taking ginkgo. In one case, an HIV-positive male experienced over a 50% decrease in efavirenz levels over the course of 14 months while taking ginkgo extract. HIV-1 RNA copies also increased substantially, from less than 50 to more than 1500. It is suspected that terpenoids from the ginkgo extract reduced drug levels by inducing cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (16821). In another case report, a patient stable on antiviral therapy including efavirenz for 10 years, had an increase in viral load from <50 copies/mL to 1350 copies/mL after 2 months of taking a combination of supplements including ginkgo. After stopping ginkgo, the viral load was again controlled with the same antiviral therapy regimen (25464).\nless\nIBUPROFEN (Advil, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, ginkgo might increase the risk of bleeding when used with ibuprofen.\nGinkgo might have antiplatelet effects and has been associated with several case reports of spontaneous bleeding. In one case, a 71-year-old male had taken a specific ginkgo extract (Gingium, Biocur) 40 mg twice daily for 2.5 years. About 4 weeks after starting ibuprofen 600 mg daily he experienced a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage (13179). However, the antiplatelet effects of ginkgo have been questioned. A meta-analysis and other studies have not found a significant antiplatelet effect with standardized ginkgo extracts, 80 mg to 480 mg taken daily for up to 32 weeks (17179).\nless\nNIFEDIPINE (Procardia)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, taking ginkgo with oral, but not intravenous, nifedipine might increase levels and adverse effects of nifedipine.\nAnimal research and some clinical evidence suggests that taking ginkgo leaf extract orally in combination with oral nifedipine might increase nifedipine levels and cause increased side effects, such as headaches, dizziness, and hot flushes (87764, 87765). However, taking ginkgo orally does not seem to affect the pharmacokinetics of intravenous nifedipine (87765).\nless\nOMEPRAZOLE (Prilosec)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, taking ginkgo with omeprazole might decrease the levels and clinical effects of omeprazole.\nClinical research shows that a specific ginkgo leaf extract (Remembrance, Herbs Product LTD) 140 mg twice daily can induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzymes and decrease levels of omeprazole by about 27% to 42% (13108).\nless\nP-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, taking ginkgo with P-glycoprotein substrates might increase the levels and adverse effects of these substrates.\nA small clinical study in healthy volunteers shows that using ginkgo leaf extract 120 mg orally three times daily for 14 days can increase levels of the P-glycoprotein substrate, talinolol, by 36% in healthy male individuals.

Risperidone is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP3A4. CYP3A4 activity might be affected by ginkgo. Theoretically, ginkgo may inhibit the metabolism of risperidone and increase the risk of adverse effects.\nless\nROSIGLITAZONE (Avandia)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, ginkgo might decrease the levels and clinical effects of rosiglitazone.\nAnimal research shows that ginkgo leaf extract orally 100 or 200 mg/kg daily for 10 days alters the pharmacodynamics of rosiglitazone in a dose-dependent manner. The 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg doses reduce the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of rosiglitazone by 39% and 52%, respectively, and the half-life by 28% and 39%, respectively. It is hypothesized that these changes may be due to induction of cytochrome P450 2C8 by ginkgo (109525).\nless\nSEIZURE THRESHOLD LOWERING DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, taking ginkgo with drugs that lower the seizure threshold might increase the risk for convulsions.\nGinkgo seeds contain ginkgotoxin.

This interaction appears to be time-dependent and due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 by these bioflavonoids. In rats given tacrolimus 1 mg/kg orally, amentoflavone was shown to increase the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of tacrolimus by 3.8-fold (111330).\nless\nTALINOLOL\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTaking ginkgo with talinolol seems to increase blood levels of talinolol.\nThere is some evidence that using ginkgo leaf extract 120 mg orally three times daily for 14 days can increase levels of talinolol by 36% in healthy male individuals.

The coma was reversed by administration of flumazenil (Romazicon). Coma might have been induced by excessive GABA-ergic activity. Ginkgo flavonoids are thought to have GABA-ergic activity and act directly on benzodiazepine receptors. Ginkgo might also increase metabolism of trazodone to active GABA-ergic metabolites, possibly by inducing cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolism (6423).\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Case-control study)\nGinkgo has been shown to increase the risk of bleeding in some people when taken with warfarin.\nSeveral pharmacodynamic studies suggest that ginkgo inhibits platelet aggregation.

Information from a medical database suggests that when taken concurrently with warfarin, ginkgo increases the risk of a bleeding adverse event by 38% (91326). There is also some evidence that ginkgo leaf extract can inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9, an enzyme that metabolizes warfarin. This could result in increased warfarin levels (12061). However, population and clinical research has produced mixed results. Clinical research in healthy people suggests that ginkgo has no effect on INR, or the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin (12881, 15176, 87727, 87889). A meta-analysis of 18 studies using standardized ginkgo extracts, 80 mg to 480 mg daily for up to 32 weeks, did not find a significant effect on platelet aggregation, fibrinogen concentration, or PT/aPTT (17179).

The patient recovered following intravenous fluid treatment and cessation of ginkgo.\nless\nINFERTILITY\nTheoretically, ginkgo might reduce the likelihood of conception; until more is known, use ginkgo with caution in couples attempting to conceive, and avoid use in couples having difficulty conceiving. Some laboratory research suggests that ginkgo extract might inhibit oocyte fertilization (4239, 4240). This effect has not yet been demonstrated in humans.\nless\nPERIOPERATIVE\nGinkgo leaf extract has antiplatelet effects and may cause excessive bleeding if used perioperatively (887, 13002, 14453). Tell patients to discontinue ginkgo at least 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures.\nless",

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nCrude ginkgo plant parts can exceed concentrations of 5 ppm of toxic ginkgolic acid constituents (5714). Ginkgolic acid is a salicylic acid derivative related to urushiol, found in poison ivy (112946). In addition, the fresh seeds contain large amounts of ginkgotoxin, which can cause seizures and death. Consuming fresh or roasted ginkgo seeds in amounts larger than the normal food amounts of 8-10 seeds per day, or long-term, can cause restlessness, seizure, loss of consciousness, or shock (8231, 8232, 12183). Ginkgo leaf and ginkgo leaf extract contain small amounts of ginkgotoxin, which is unlikely to cause these more serious effects (11296). However, there are anecdotal reports of seizure occurring after use of ginkgo leaf preparations both in patients without a history of seizure disorder and in those with previously well-controlled epilepsy (7030, 7090, 14281).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with ginkgo.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nOne pharmacokinetic study found that administration of various ginkgo extracts resulted in median maximum concentrations of bilobalide, ginkgolide A, and ginkgolide B of 3.53-26.85 ng/mL, 3.62-16.44 ng/mL, and 1.38-9.99 ng/mL, respectively (87849). Another pharmacokinetic study using the specific ginkgo leaf extract EGb 761 found a bioavailability of greater than 80% for ginkgolides A and B and 70% for bilobalide, with very low absorption of ginkgolide C (18272).\n\nA liposomal formulation of ginkgo extract (Ginkosome) has been evaluated for improved bioavailability. Research in healthy adults aged up to 40 years shows that liposomal ginkgo extract 120 mg increases the absorption of ginkgolides A and B, with a 1.9-fold and 2.2-fold increase, respectively, in the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) at 24 hours, and a 1.7-fold and 1.2-fold increase, respectively, in the maximum plasma concentration when compared with a standard extract. However, concentrations of bilobalide and terpene trilactones are not affected (109527).\nExcretion\nThe ginkgo constituents quercetin and kaempferol are excreted in the urine mainly as glucuronides (87740). In a pharmacokinetic study using the specific ginkgo leaf extract EGb 761, the half-lives of ginkgolides A and B and bilobalide were 4, 6, and 3 hours, respectively, and the amounts of each excreted unchanged in the urine were approximately 70%, 50%, and 30%, respectively (18272).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of ginkgo are the leaf and the seed. Ginkgo leaf is the most commonly used form of ginkgo, usually as an extract.\n\nGinkgo leaf and its extracts contain several active constituents including flavonoids, terpenoids, and organic acids (87722, 87735, 87771, 87785, 87955, 88053). Many ginkgo leaf extracts are standardized to contain about 24% to 25% flavonoid glycosides and 6% terpenoids. The major flavonoids are primarily derived from the flavonol rutin and include isorhamnetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and 3-O-methylmyristicins. The primary terpenoid lactones are ginkgolides A, B, C, M, and J, and bilobalide (1515). Ginkgolide K may also be present, although this appears to be less common (108610). Other constituents of ginkgo leaf extracts include biflavones (including amentoflavone, bilobetin, 5-methoxybilobetin, ginkgetin, isoginkgetin, and sciadopitysin), proanthocyanidins, alkylphenols, phenolic acids, and polyprenols (18272, 112946).\n\nAlthough many of ginkgo's constituents have intrinsic pharmacological effects individually, there is evidence that the constituents work synergistically to produce more potent pharmacological effects than any individual constituent (1514, 6494).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn animals, the standardized ginkgo extract EGb 761 inhibits carrageenan-induced inflammation (87872). Preliminary clinical evidence shows that ginkgo extract 1 gram three times daily for 3 months reduces levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in patients with pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, leading to improvements in symptoms and lung function (87772). Other human research shows that ginkgo reduces levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (103573). A meta-analysis of 17 trials shows that ginkgo leaf extracts reduce levels of CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, with weighted mean differences of -1.5 mg/L, -16.9 pcg/mL, and -4.19 pcg/mL, respectively, when compared with controls. The beneficial effect on CRP levels is seen at ginkgo doses below 500 mg daily in patients with elevated CRP at baseline. The beneficial effect on IL-6 occurs at ginkgo doses of at least 120 mg daily (109528). However, the individual studies were small, showed significant heterogeneity, were of variable duration (1-24 weeks), and used a wide range of daily ginkgo doses (17.5-1500 mg).\nAnticancer effects\nSome clinical or epidemiological evidence suggests that ginkgo may be helpful in the prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer (9872), gastric cancer (87742), ovarian cancer (14813), and pancreatic cancer (87699). The exact anticarcinogenic mechanism of action of ginkgo extract is not clear. In humans, ginkgo extract appears to prevent the iodine-131-induced increase in lymphocyte micronuclei and clastogenic factors, which suggests that ginkgo extract may prevent genotoxic damage (87892). In vitro evidence suggests that ginkgo extract and the constituents quercetin and ginkgolides A and B inhibit ovarian cancer cell proliferation by blocking the G0/G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (14813). Additional in vitro research shows that ginkgolide B, a constituent of ginkgo extract, can up- and down-regulate various proteins involved in proliferation, tumor suppression, and DNA damage repair in breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1)-mutant ovarian epithelial cells (87882). Other in vitro evidence suggests that exocarp polysaccharides from ginkgo extract can induce apoptosis and differentiation of gastric cancer cells, possibly by altering the expression of c-myc, bcl-2, and c-fos genes (87742).\nAnticoagulant/antiplatelet effects\nGinkgolides in the leaf competitively inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) binding at the membrane receptors of numerous cells (5719, 9760, 87871). PAF inhibition decreases platelet aggregation (5717). Also, preliminary research suggests that ginkgo leaf extract can inhibit formation of platelet thromboxane A2 and thromboxane B2, which reduces platelet aggregation (8583).\n\nHowever, in humans, there is evidence that ginkgo leaf may not reduce platelet aggregation and blood clotting with short-term use. In one study, healthy men who took the specific ginkgo leaf extract (EGb 761) 160 mg twice daily for 7 days did not have reduced prothrombin times (12114). It has been suggested that ginkgo has to be taken for at least 2-3 weeks to have a significant effect on platelet aggregation (14811). However, a meta-analysis of 18 studies (1985 patients) using standardized ginkgo extracts, 80-480 mg daily for up to 32 weeks, did not find a significant effect on platelet aggregation, fibrinogen concentration, or PT/aPTT (17179).\nAntidiabetic effects\nGinkgo might affect insulin secretion. In healthy volunteers, ginkgo leaf extract (EGb 761) seems to increase pancreatic beta-cell function in response to glucose loading and modestly reduce blood pressure. Some researchers speculate that ginkgo might decrease development of hyperinsulinemia associated with hypertension, which often precedes development of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (5719).\n\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes, the effect of ginkgo on insulin appears to be dependent on the insulin-producing status of the patient. In diet-controlled diabetes patients with hyperinsulinemia, taking ginkgo does not seem to significantly affect insulin or blood glucose levels following an oral glucose tolerance test. In those patients with hyperinsulinemia who are treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, taking ginkgo seems to result in decreased insulin levels and increased blood glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test. Researchers speculate that this could be due to ginkgo-enhanced hepatic metabolism of insulin or of diabetes drugs (14448); however, ginkgo does not seem to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of metformin (14454).\n\nIn patients with pancreatic exhaustion, taking ginkgo seems to stimulate pancreatic beta-cells resulting in increased insulin levels and increase C-peptide levels in response to an oral glucose tolerance test (14448).\n\nGinkgo does not appear to affect insulin resistance or glucose disposal in patients with or without type 2 diabetes (14350).\nAntimicrobial effects\nGinkgo leaf might have some antimicrobial activity, including activity against Pneumocystis carinii and possibly some gram-positive bacteria and yeast (6069).\n\nGinkgo seeds seem to have antibacterial and antifungal effects (11701, 11702).\nAntioxidant effects\nAlthough the mechanism of action of ginkgo leaf is only partially understood, there are several theories about how it might work for various disease states. Ginkgo leaf flavonoids have antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties (2660, 5715, 5717, 5719, 14455, 87871, 87945). In elderly patients, intake of ginkgo extract has been shown to increase levels of the radical scavenger glutathione in the liver of elderly patients and reduce platelet malondialdehyde levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (14455, 87890). The flavonoids seem to prevent or reduce cell membrane lipid peroxidation (1515, 14455), and decrease oxidative damage to erythrocytes (5717). Ginkgo's flavonoids also protect neurons and retinal tissue from oxidative stress (1515, 5719), and injury following ischemic episodes (1515, 2660, 87832, 87929, 87941, 87957, 87968). Ginkgo terpene lactones, such as ginkgolide B, Protecting neurons and other tissues from oxidative damage might prevent progression of tissue degeneration in patients with dementia and other conditions.\nCardiovascular effects\nGinkgolides in the leaf competitively inhibit platelet activating factor (PAF) binding at the membrane receptors of numerous cells (5719, 9760, 87871). PAF inhibition decreases platelet aggregation (5717), decreases phagocyte chemotaxis and smooth muscle contraction (1515), prevents degranulation of neutrophils, decreases free radical production (5716, 5717), decreases damaging glycine production after brain injury, and reduces excitatory amino acid receptor function (2660). Inhibition of PAF might increase cardiac contractility and coronary blood flow.\n\nGinkgo leaf products might benefit CNS and vascular conditions by improving circulation. Ginkgo leaf seems to improve blood flow to capillaries throughout the body including in the CNS, eyes, ears, extremities, and other tissues. Ginkgo leaf likely improves circulation by both decreasing blood viscosity and affecting vascular smooth muscle. Ginkgo leaf seems to restore the balance between prostacyclin and thromboxane A2, resulting in improved vasoregulation. Therefore, ginkgo leaf relaxes spasmodic contracting vasculature and contracts abnormally dilated vessels. It is not clear exactly how ginkgo causes vascular contraction and improves venous tone, but these effects might be due to phosphodiesterase inhibition, resulting in increased cAMP levels and release of catecholamines (6492). Some ginkgo constituents may also have a potent relaxing effect on vascular smooth muscle and improve blood flow to the corpus cavernosum; which is thought to be helpful for erectile dysfunction (213). Overall, ginkgo leaf seems to increase cerebral and peripheral blood flow microcirculation, and reduce vascular permeability (5721, 6492).\n\nIn addition to decreasing platelet aggregation and improving circulation, some evidence shows that ginkgo extract may also have cardioprotective effects. When administered to patients as part of the cardioplegia perfusion during cardiac surgery, ginkgo extract appears to induce the production of plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (87825). Also, evidence from animal research shows that ginkgo extract or its constituent ginkgolide B may attenuate ischemia- and reperfusion-induced arrhythmia and other injury (87833, 87894, 87914, 87917).\nDrug metabolizing effects\nGinkgo appears to affect several cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro and in animal models; however, in humans, ginkgo does not seem to significantly affect most of these enzymes (14452). There is preliminary evidence that ginkgo leaf extract is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), decreasing activity by approximately 13% (1303); however, contradictory clinical research suggests that ginkgo leaf extract does not significantly affect the activity of CYP1A2 (10847).\n\nThe effects of ginkgo leaf extract on CYP3A4 are unclear. There is some in vitro evidence that ginkgo leaf extract might inhibit CYP3A4 (6450, 11026); however, in vivo, ginkgo leaf extract does not seem to inhibit CYP3A4 (1303, 10847, 11029). In addition, there is anecdotal evidence that suggests ginkgo leaf extract might actually induce CYP3A4 (6423, 16821), but this effect has not yet been verified.\n\nThe ginkgo leaf extract EGb 761 (Ginkgold, others), which is the most common extract used in clinical studies, seems to strongly inhibit CYP2C9 in vitro (11026, 12061, 14337).\n\nDifferent constituents in ginkgo seem to have different effects on hepatic enzymes. The terpenoidic fraction (ginkgolides) seems to inhibit just CYP2C9 in vitro and possibly p-glycoprotein in vivo (16821). The flavonoidic fraction (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, etc.) seems to inhibit CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2E1 in vitro (11026, 11028, 12061).\n\nHowever, clinical research suggests that ginkgo leaf extract does not significantly affect the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 (10847, 14337), while inhibition of CYP2C19 occurred in one study in humans (13108).\n\nGinkgo extract appears to mildly inhibit CYP2D6 enzymes, by about 9% (1303, 6423, 6450, 11026, 12061); however, this effect might be too small to be clinically significant (11029). Some clinical research suggests that ginkgo leaf extract does not significantly affect the activity CYP2D6 (10847). Additional clinical research suggests that taking ginkgo 90 mg daily for 30 days does not affect levels of donepezil, a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 substrate (11027).\n\nIn vitro, ginkgo seems to inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) uptake of estrone-3-sulfate. But ginkgo might not cause clinically significant interactions through this mechanism. In healthy volunteers, ginkgo does not seem to significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of the OATP substrate ticlopidine (14451, 17111).\nLipid-lowering effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that ginkgo extract decreases total cholesterol content, inhibits HMG-CoA reductase activity, and decreases cholesterol influx in cultured hepatocytes (87840). A model in rats with hyperlipidemia suggests that administering ginkgo extract leads to lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with rats given atorvastatin alone (111331). However, it is unclear if ginkgo extract has lipid-lowering effects in humans.\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nGinkgo leaf extract might be helpful for Alzheimer disease due to effects on beta-amyloid proteins. There is preliminary evidence that ginkgo leaf extract can inhibit toxicity and cell death induced by beta-amyloid peptides (6494). However, this has not yet been demonstrated in vivo. Ginkgo might also influence certain neurotransmitter systems, such as the cholinergic system (6490), and seems to produce EEG changes similar to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor tacrine (Cognex) (6067). There has been some speculation that ginkgo leaf inhibits monoamine oxidase A and B (5721), but so far studies have found conflicting results (6231, 6232, 6233). It is suggested that ginkgo leaf inhibits catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT, an enzyme which breaks down adrenergic transmitters) and increases the number of alpha-adrenoreceptors in the brain; which would help reverse the decline in brain alpha-adrenoceptor activity that occurs with aging (2660).\n\nThere is some evidence that ginkgo flavonoids have GABA-ergic effects and might directly affect benzodiazepine receptors (6423). However, the clinical significance of this effect is not known.\n\nGinkgo leaf extract might have effects on neurotransmitters. Animal model studies have shown that ginkgo leaf extract significantly reduces uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (17297, 17298). However, this effect is not seen after a single 100 mg/kg dose, but was found after 14 days of therapy (17298).\n\nThe ginkgolides A and B seem to decrease glucocorticoid biosynthesis, which might also play a role in ginkgo's proposed anti-stress and neuroprotective effects (5723, 5724, 8236). Some evidence shows that a specific ginkgo extract (EGb 761, Tanakan) reduces stress-induced rises in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and blood pressure in animals and in healthy volunteers (15578).\n\nGinkgo extract may also protect against neurotoxicity induced by other drugs. Animal research shows that ginkgo extract protects retinal cells against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity (88051). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that standardized ginkgo extract called EGb 761 protects against neurodegeneration induced by verapamil or antimycin A1 plus 2-deoxy-D-glucose (87874, 87975).\nSeizure threshold-lowering effects\nGinkgo seeds contain the neurotoxin ginkgotoxin (4'-O-methylpyridoxine), which can cause seizures, paralysis, and death when taken in high doses (8231, 8232, 12183). Ginkgotoxin antagonizes the activity of pyridoxine, possibly by inhibiting enzymes such as pyridoxal kinase or glutamate decarboxylase in the brain. Therefore, since GABA is synthesized from glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase, by inhibiting glutamate decarboxylase, ginkgotoxin indirectly inhibits GABA (13423). Boiling ginkgo seeds reduces the ginkgotoxin content to safe levels (11296).\n\nGinkgo leaves and ginkgo leaf extracts can also contain the ginkgotoxin; however, ginkgotoxin is present in much higher amounts in ginkgo seeds than leaves. It is unclear whether it is present in ginkgo leaf extracts in high enough concentrations to cause toxicity (11296). However, seizures have been reported in people taking ginkgo leaf preparations (6048, 7030, 7090, 9760, 14281)."

It is used as an emulsifier and thickener in food, having a high viscosity and the ability to absorb up to 100 times its weight in water (92005, 92008, 92009, 106411). In 2020, it was added to the list of dietary fibers that can be declared on Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels in the US (101509).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally as food (11358, 11359). Glucomannan powder or flour is often used to enrich noodles in traditional Japanese foods.\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally with at least 250 mL (8 ounces) of water or other fluid. Glucomannan has been safely used in studies lasting up to 4 months (178, 179, 181, 182, 11046, 11294, 11357, 11294, 54240, 57775)(57781, 57783, 57784, 92004, 92008, 92009, 92010, 92011, 106410). In the European Union, the maximum permitted level in foods is 10 grams/kg (106411).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally without any liquid, especially when in tablet form. There have been reports of choking and esophageal or gastrointestinal obstruction when glucomannan products are taken dry. A safety alert for this has been issued by Health Canada (11293, 57785, 106410).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately with at least 250 mL (8 ounces) of water or other fluid.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, glucomannan is generally well tolerated when taken with plenty of water or other liquid.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, and vomiting.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Choking and esophageal or gastrointestinal obstruction, especially when taken as a dry powder or in tablet form.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, glucomannan can cause gastrointestinal disturbances, including abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, and vomiting, especially when taken in doses of more than 3 grams daily (57781, 57784, 92004, 92010, 92011, 97935, 106411). Esophageal and gastrointestinal obstructions have been reported when dry glucomannan-containing products are taken with insufficient fluid (11293, 57785, 106410).\nless\nHepatic\nAcute cholestatic hepatitis occurred in a 31-year-old male after taking glucomannan orally for 45 days (57777). He was also taking other supplements, including garlic and chitosan, so it is unclear whether the hepatitis was due to glucomannan, other supplements, or the combination.\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nCases of occupational respiratory disorders, including respiratory sensitization and bronchial asthma, have been reported in workers exposed to glucomannan (57789, 57810).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nConstipation. Glucomannan is generally effective for treatment of constipation in adults, but the efficacy in children is less clear.\nClinical research in adults shows that taking glucomannan 1-1.5 grams three times daily orally for 3-5 weeks, sometimes followed by 1 gram twice daily for an additional 4 weeks, can relieve constipation. As a nonabsorbable dietary fiber, glucomannan appears to have a bulk laxative effect (11294, 57783, 57795, 57816). Taking glucomannan 1.45 grams with lactulose 4.2 grams twice daily orally for 1-3 months appears to relieve constipation during pregnancy (57818).\n\nIn children with constipation, glucomannan can increase the frequency of bowel movements but does not seem to improve stool consistency. A meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials including 122 children with functional constipation shows that glucomannan leads to 1.4 more stools per week but does not improve stool consistency when compared with placebo or a maltodextrin control (97935). Two studies included in this analysis show that taking a specific glucomannan supplement (Dicoplus, Dicofarm) 100 mg/kg once or twice daily (maximum daily dose 5 grams) along with fluids for up to 12 weeks relieves constipation in children (11295, 57775). However, the other clinical study included in the analysis shows that taking a different glucomannan supplement (Dicoman Junior, Vitis Pharma) 1.26 grams twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve constipation in children (92005).\nless\nDiabetes. Limited clinical research suggests that glucomannan may improve glycemic control and lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nTaking glucomannan orally seems to reduce serum cholesterol and blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (183, 11357, 11359, 57791, 57797, 57798, 112702). Most clinical research shows that a glucomannan dose of 3-15 grams daily for 4-12 weeks may reduce fasting blood glucose (183, 11357, 57791, 57797, 111225). Eating cookies containing glucomannan 0.5-0.7 grams per 100 kcal for 3 weeks has also been used (11358, 11359, 57797). Accordingly, a meta-analysis of 5 mostly small, low-quality clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes, that includes several of these studies, shows that taking glucomannan 1.2-15 grams daily for 4-16 weeks modestly improves fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo or wheat bran. This analysis also shows that taking glucomannan modestly improves 2-hour post-prandial glucose, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels but not triglycerides (112702). In healthy people, adding a specific glucomannan supplement (PolyGlycopleX, InovoBiologic Inc.) as granules, 2.5-7.5 grams before meals, or as capsules 3-6 grams with meals, can reduce the glycemic index of starchy foods (92003, 92007). Also, taking this glucomannan product reduces postprandial glucose in a dose-dependent fashion in healthy people (92002, 92007). However, the interpretation of this evidence is limited by low-quality research and variations in dosages and formulations.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Most clinical research shows that glucomannan can reduce cholesterol levels in healthy people and those with hyperlipidemia.\nAlthough some conflicting evidence exists (57794), most research shows that taking glucomannan orally can improve lipid levels in healthy adults, children and adults with hyperlipidemia, and adults with diabetes (178, 11357, 11358, 11359, 57779, 57781, 57784, 57791, 57799, 97936)( 112702). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking glucomannan 2.5-15.1 grams daily for up to 12 weeks can reduce total cholesterol by 19 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 13-16 mg/dL, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 12 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 11 mg/dL when compared with a control (57797, 97936). Clinical research has not demonstrated a dose-response relationship, and the most common glucomannan doses are 5-10 grams daily for up to 6 weeks for adults and 2-3 grams daily in divided doses for up to 8 weeks for children (11358, 11359, 57797, 97936).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDumping syndrome. It is unclear if oral glucomannan is beneficial in patients with dumping syndrome.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking glucomannan (Propol, Pharmacia) 2.6 or 5.2 grams as a single dose reduces the incidence of reactive hypoglycemia following an oral glucose load in adult patients with previous gastric surgery (57805). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking glucomannan improves glucose tolerance, but not glucose absorption, in children experiencing gastric dumping syndrome after gastric surgery (57804).\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral glucomannan is beneficial in patients with hypertension.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hypertension shows that eating cookies containing 0.7 grams of glucomannan per 100 kcal, for a total dose of up to 13 grams of glucomannan daily for 3 weeks, can lower systolic blood pressure by about 7% when compared with placebo (11359).\nless\nHyperthyroidism. It is unclear if oral glucomannan is beneficial in patients with hyperthyroidism.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hyperthyroidism shows that taking glucomannan 1.3 grams twice daily orally, plus methimazole and propranolol for 2 months, reduces serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels during the first few weeks of therapy, when compared with methimazole and propranolol alone. However, these effects seem to diminish after 6 weeks of therapy (57793).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral glucomannan is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nA small crossover study in adults with metabolic syndrome, defined as impaired glucose tolerance, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, elevated serum triglycerides, and moderate hypertension, shows that consuming biscuits containing glucomannan 0.5 grams per 100 kcal (equivalent to approximately 8-13 grams/day) daily for 3 weeks may modestly improve fasting glucose, but does not improve blood pressure or levels of triglycerides or HDL cholesterol when compared with wheat bran biscuits (11358). However, the 2-week washout period between interventions may be too short to detect differences in some outcomes.\nless\nObesity. Although some low-quality research shows that oral glucomannan is beneficial for achieving slight improvements in body weight, other research does not support this.\nMeta-analyses of clinical research on the use of glucomannan for improving body weight and body composition in adults and children with overweight or obesity show mixed results, with one analysis suggesting that taking glucomannan reduces body weight by around 0.8 kg when compared with placebo (57797), and another showing no improvement in body weight (92014). Reasons for these discrepant findings are not clear, but the discrepancies may relate to differences in the study populations and dosing and duration of glucomannan treatment, as well as the low methodological quality of many studies conducted to date.\n\nSimilar to the pooled analyses described above, individual clinical study results are also mixed. Several small clinical studies show that taking glucomannan can improve body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, and other measures of body composition in children and adults with overweight or obesity, usually when used in combination with a calorie-restricted diet (180, 181, 182, 183, 54240, 92008, 92010, 92011, 111224, 112701). However, conflicting evidence exists (179, 57784, 57790, 57796, 92009, 112430). Doses that have been used with positive outcomes in adults are 3-4 grams daily, taken in divided doses, for up to 3 months (181, 182, 183, 92008, 112701). In children, doses were 2-3 grams daily for 4 months (180). Specific products evaluated include Propylene TM (Natural Alternatives International), PolyGlycopleX (InovoBiologic, Inc.) 3-5 grams 2-3 times daily for 15 weeks, and. Chrombalance 338 mg before each meal and 226 mg in the afternoon daily for 5 weeks (54240, 92010, 92011).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate glucomannan for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGlucomannan is most commonly used in doses of 3-10 grams daily, as a single or divided dose, for 3 weeks to 3 months See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nGlucomannan has been used in doses of 2-5 grams daily, as a single or divided dose, for up to 4 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn foods, glucomannan powder or flour is used (11358, 11359). For medicinal purposes, powdered or encapsulated oral formulations are most commonly used (178, 179, 181, 182, 11046, 11294, 11357, 11294, 54240, 57775)(57781, 57783, 57784, 92004, 92008, 92009, 92010, 92011).

A small clinical study in healthy volunteers shows that taking glyburide 2.5 mg plus glucomannan 3.9 grams with breakfast reduces plasma levels of glyburide when compared with breakfast and glyburide alone (11360). In addition, animal research demonstrates this effect on amoxicillin, but shows increased absorption of metronidazole. This mouse model also demonstrates that metronidazole elimination is prolonged, but amoxicillin elimination is enhanced by 38%; glucomannan may also affect the distribution of some drugs (112703). To avoid changes in absorption, take glucomannan 30-60 minutes after taking oral drugs.\nless",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with glucomannan.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Metabolism\nGlucomannan is degraded by soluble enzymes such as endo-1,4-beta-mannanase in feces to give 4-O-beta-D-mannopyranosyl-D-mannopyranose (beta-1,4-D-mannobiose), 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucopyranose (cellobiose), 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannopyranose, and small amounts of glucose and mannose (57772, 57821). Glucomannan is also fermented by colonic bacteria in the large intestine to produce short-chain fatty acids as well as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and 1-butyric acid (57772, 57819, 106411). The optimal pH for hydrolysis of glucomannan is around 7-8 (57819).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGlucomannan is a high-molecular weight, water-soluble, non-digestible polysaccharide composed of D-glucose and D-mannose units connected by beta (1, 4)-glycosidic bonds (11361, 57774, 106411). It is found in many plants, yeast, and fungi; however, glucomannan dietary supplements are usually derived from konjac (Amorphophallus konjac) tubers (11361). Compared to other dietary fibers including wheat bran, psyllium, prickly pear cactus, and others, glucomannan has the highest proportion of soluble fiber (57814).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIt is thought that glucomannan may work to improve glycemic control by slowing gastric emptying and increasing the viscosity of gastrointestinal contents (11361, 57774).\nGastrointestinal effects\nGlucomannan is a water-soluble, non-digestible carbohydrate that functions as a bulk-forming laxative and increases water absorption by the stools (11294, 11295, 57783, 57774). Clinical research shows that glucomannan can reduce mouth-to-cecum transit time (57802).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nAnimal research shows that dietary glucomannan may prevent the development or exacerbation of eczema by modulating autoimmune function (57778, 57788).\nLipid effects\nGlucomannan is thought to exert its hypolipidemic effects by enhancing fecal excretion of cholesterol and bile acids and by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis (11357, 57774, 111223). Some clinical evidence also suggests that glucomannan might reduce triglycerides by increasing levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), which work in tandem to hydrolyze triglycerides and deliver lipid nutrients to target tissues (111223).\nUltraviolet protective effects\nIn vitro, glucomannan isolated from Candida utilis had photoprotective effects on human keratinocytes, suppressing UVB-induced apoptosis and preventing the decrease in viability of the cells (57792). It is not known if glucomannan isolated from konjac has the same protective effects.\nWeight loss effects\nGlucomannan might exert beneficial effects on weight by promoting satiety and fecal energy loss (57780, 57774). Additionally, glucomannan, a soluble fiber, slows carbohydrate absorption which might improve weight loss (57776). It also increases satiety because it increases in size in the presence of liquids. Also, in human research, four weeks of \"chewing training,\" using a food made with glucomannan that increases the number of chewing strokes and chewing time to swallowing, was found to increase maximal biting force and chewing performance (57803). It is possible that increased chewing time may play a role in the weight loss effects of glucomannan. In human research, increased thermogenesis did not appear to play a role in the weight loss effect (57808)"

            "Overview": "Glucosamine is an amino sugar. It is produced naturally in humans and is also found in fungal cell walls and in the polysaccharides chitosan and chitin. In humans, glucosamine is required for the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and hyaluronic acid (12464). As a dietary supplement, glucosamine is available in three separate forms that are not considered interchangeable - glucosamine hydrochloride, glucosamine sulfate, and N-acetyl glucosamine. This monograph encompasses all three salt forms. German physicians first reported the use of glucosamine as a therapeutic agent for osteoarthritis in 1969 (89589).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when glucosamine sulfate is used orally and appropriately. Glucosamine sulfate has been used safely in multiple clinical trials at a dose of 1000-1500 mg daily for 4 weeks to 3 years (2604, 7026, 8942, 11340, 12461)(14305, 16717, 89558, 89567, 94380, 94382, 95785).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when glucosamine hydrochloride is used orally and appropriately. Glucosamine hydrochloride has been used with apparent safety at a dose of 1400-1600 mg daily for up to 2 years (4237, 13579, 14809, 18344, 42477, 89516, 89519, 95784). Glucosamine hydrochloride 2 grams daily has also been used with apparent safety for up to 3 weeks (103281). ...when N-acetyl glucosamine is used orally and appropriately. N-acetyl glucosamine 100 mg daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 24 weeks (95795). ...when N-acetyl glucosamine is applied topically and appropriately.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, all forms of glucosamine seem to be well tolerated. Topically and rectally, N-acetyl glucosamine also seems to be well tolerated. Intramuscularly, glucosamine sulfate seems to be well tolerated. However, a thorough evaluation of safety outcomes has not been conducted for non-oral routes of administration.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Bloating, constipation, cramps, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: There have been rare reports of severe allergic reactions and hepatotoxicity.\nCardiovascular\nOne case of mesenteric occlusion in a clinical trial was considered possibly related to use of oral glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate (89520).\n\nSome observational research has found that glucosamine use in patients with osteoarthritis is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events when compared with non-use (109642). However, glucosamine users tended to be older, have multiple comorbidities, and be on antihyperlipidemic or antiplatelet therapy. Furthermore, other observational research in healthy adults has found that glucosamine use is associated with a reduced risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD events (99682). Higher quality, prospective research is needed to clarify the relationship, if any, between glucosamine and CVD risk.\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, glucosamine might cause skin reactions, including itching, rash, and erythema (2608, 20084, 89567, 110628, 113636). Also, fingernail and toenail toughening, with an increased rate of growth, has been reported (89572). Topically, N-acetyl glucosamine 2% with niacinamide 4% cream might cause rare skin reactions (92721). Photosensitization that was reproducible with re-challenge was reported in a case report of an individual using glucosamine (form unknown) and chondroitin (10408).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, glucosamine does not seem to impact blood glucose. Preliminary research and anecdotal reports have found that various forms of glucosamine might increase insulin resistance or decrease insulin production, increasing fasting plasma glucose levels (22, 371, 372, 1203, 3406, 5059, 7637, 14810). This has raised concerns that taking glucosamine sulfate might worsen diabetes and decrease the effectiveness of diabetes drugs. However, clinical research suggests that various forms of glucosamine do not have adverse effects on blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) in healthy, obese, patients with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (7026, 7075, 7638, 8942, 10311, 10317, 12107, 14808, 15111, 89563).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, glucosamine has been associated with gastrointestinal problems, including epigastric and abdominal pain, cramps, heartburn, diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting, constipation, and flatulence (1520, 2608, 16717, 20084, 20104, 20105, 89561, 89562, 89567, 89568)(108897, 110628, 111647, 113636). In older persons, use of glucosamine sulfate is associated with oral dryness (89564). In a clinical trial, a case of Helicobacter pylori gastritis was considered probably related to the use of glucosamine hydrochloride (89516).\nless\nHepatic\nAlthough relatively uncommon, combinations of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have been associated with acute liver injury that mimics autoimmune hepatitis. Of 151 patients at an outpatient clinic for liver diseases, 23 acknowledged use of products containing glucosamine (form unspecified) and/or chondroitin. However, only 2 cases had an apparent relationship between transaminase elevation and the use of recommended doses of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. Aminotransferase levels, which were increased by four- to seven-fold, returned to normal following discontinuation of treatment (89515). In another case, a 65-year-old male presented to the hospital with signs and symptoms of drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis. The patient had used Condrosulf, containing chondroitin sulfate, for two years, followed by Vita Mobility Complex, containing chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulfate, for 8 weeks. The patient required maintenance treatment with azathioprine to remain in remission (89518). A case of acute cholestatic hepatitis due to Glucosamine Forte, which contains glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, Devil's claw, and shark cartilage, has been reported (89522). It is unclear whether these adverse events were related to glucosamine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nImmunologic\nThere is some concern that glucosamine products might cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. One review of glucosamine-related adverse events in Australia found that 72% of all reports involved hypersensitivity reactions. Of these reactions, 35% were mild, including pruritis, urticaria, and lip edema, 49% were moderate, including dyspnea, and 16% were severe, including gait disturbance, somnolence, and hypotension. Anaphylaxis was reported in 1.5% of cases (102115). Also, in one clinical trial, a single patient developed allergic dermatitis considered to be likely due to glucosamine hydrochloride (89516). Glucosamine is derived from the exoskeletons of shrimp, lobster, and crabs. However, it is unclear if these adverse reactions were due to a shellfish sensitivity or general atopy. Additionally, shellfish allergies are caused by IgE antibodies to antigens in the meat of shellfish, not to antigens in the exoskeleton. Regardless, it is possible that some glucosamine products might be contaminated by this allergen during production (102115).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, glucosamine has been reported to cause drowsiness and headache (2608, 89561, 113636). Glucosamine plus chondroitin combination products that also contain manganese (e.g., CosaminDS) should always be taken according to product directions. When taken at doses slightly higher than the recommended dose, these products can sometimes supply greater than the tolerable upper limit (UL) for manganese which is 11 mg/day. Ingestion of more than 11 mg/day of manganese might cause significant central nervous system toxicity (7135).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nIn older persons, use of glucosamine sulfate has been associated with ocular dryness (89564). Increased intraocular pressure has occurred with glucosamine sulfate supplementation (89573, 112460). Data from the FDA MedWatch adverse event reporting system shows that 0.21% of subjects taking glucosamine reported glaucoma, which is significantly greater than the 0.08% of subjects who reported glaucoma while using any other drug (112460).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nCases of asthma exacerbations associated with the use of glucosamine (form unknown)-chondroitin products have been reported (10002).\nless\nRenal\nAnecdotal reports have associated glucosamine with nephrotoxicity signals such as modestly elevated creatine phosphokinase and 1+ to 2+ proteinuria, but changes in kidney function have not been reported in long-term studies (7026, 8942, 10408, 10409). It was also noted that effects may have been due to other concurrent medications or impurities in glucosamine-chondroitin products. Cases of acute interstitial nephritis induced by glucosamine (form unknown) have also been reported (89523).\nless\nOther\nThere has been concern that glucosamine might increase the risk of metabolic disturbances resulting in increased cholesterol levels and blood pressure. However, glucosamine does not appear to increase the risk of these adverse effects. Taking glucosamine sulfate for up to 3 years does not significantly increase blood glucose or lipid levels, or cause any other disturbances in metabolism (7026, 7075, 8942, 10311, 10317).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nOsteoarthritis. Oral glucosamine sulfate taken for at least 4 weeks is modestly beneficial for improving pain and function in knee osteoarthritis. However, oral glucosamine hydrochloride seems to only be beneficial when used in combination with chondroitin and other ingredients. It is unclear if glucosamine can slow disease progression or improve symptoms in other forms of osteoarthritis.\nMeta-analyses of the available research in adults with KNEE osteoarthritis show that taking glucosamine SULFATE 1500 mg daily for up to 3 years modestly improves pain, function, and joint space narrowing when compared with placebo (14305, 89521, 94382, 95785, 99684, 113636). Individual studies show 28% to 41% pain reduction and 21% to 46% improvement in function when compared with placebo (7026, 8942, 12461, 20084, 94382). Some research suggests that glucosamine sulfate reduces pain similarly to various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily and piroxicam 20 mg daily. However, NSAIDs appear to relieve symptoms within 2 weeks, while glucosamine sulfate takes 4-8 weeks. Notably, glucosamine sulfate appears to sustain benefit for longer after treatment withdrawal when compared with piroxicam (2604, 20094, 20096). Other clinical research shows that glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg once daily for 6 months might be more effective for reducing symptoms than acetaminophen 1 gram three times daily or 650 mg once daily in patients with moderate knee osteoarthritis (13578, 20098). However, not all research shows benefit. One meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg daily for 4 weeks to 3 years reduces some, but not all, measures of pain intensity and does not reduce pain when moving or improve function when compared with placebo (113636). Furthermore, small clinical studies suggest that glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg daily for 2-6 months may NOT work for severe, long-standing osteoarthritis (1330, 11459).\n\nIt is unclear if glucosamine sulfate can slow disease progression. A specific crystalline glucosamine sulfate product (Dona, Rotta Pharmaceuticals) taken as 1500 mg daily for up to 3 years seems to prevent joint space narrowing of greater than 0.5 mm by up to 54% when compared with placebo (7026, 8942, 13719, 42420). In contrast, other glucosamine sulfate formulations have not consistently been shown to improve symptoms or prevent joint space narrowing when compared with placebo (14305, 89558, 94382, 95788). It is unclear if the benefit seen with this specific product (Dona) is due to bias introduced by industry funding or due to a higher quality product (42492). Glucosamine products associated with quality concerns have demonstrated inconsistent benefits in research (8128, 102116).\n\nLimited research on the use of a different salt, glucosamine HYDROCHLORIDE, has found no benefit for knee osteoarthritis. A meta-analysis of clinical research and two other clinical trials show that taking glucosamine hydrochloride 1500 mg daily for up to 18 months does not seem to reduce pain when compared with placebo (18344, 89519, 89521). However, one small, unblinded clinical study in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis shows that taking a combination of glucosamine hydrochloride 480 mg every 12 hours and celecoxib 200 mg daily reduces pain scores, osteoarthritis severity, and inflammatory markers to a greater extent than celecoxib alone (106883).\n\nThere is mixed evidence of benefit when glucosamine hydrochloride is used with chondroitin. Clinical research in patients over 40 years of age shows that taking a noncommercial preparation of glucosamine hydrochloride 1500 mg daily in combination with chondroitin sulfate 1200 mg daily for 6-24 months does not reduce pain when compared with placebo. The placebo response in these studies was sometimes as high as 60% (13579, 14809, 42477). However, a large, prospective observational study in adults with knee or hip osteoarthritis suggests that taking glucosamine hydrochloride 500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 400 mg (Theraflex, Bayer) three times daily for the first 3 weeks then twice daily thereafter for up to 64 weeks is associated with reductions in pain, stiffness, and the need for concomitant analgesic therapy and improvements in daily function and knee- or hip-related quality of life when compared to baseline. The most pronounced improvements were from 16-24 weeks (111647). The validity of these effects is limited by subjective outcomes, a lack of control group, and the observational design of the study. Furthermore, another clinical trial shows that taking a prescription product available in Spain (Droglican, Bioibérica S.A.), providing a similar daily dose of glucosamine hydrochloride with chondroitin sulfate for 6 months is non-inferior to celecoxib 200 mg daily for relieving pain, but not stiffness or function (89516). Small clinical studies show that taking a specific combination product (Cosamin or Cosamin DS, Nutramax Laboratories) containing glucosamine hydrochloride 1500-2000 mg, low molecular weight chondroitin sulfate 1200-1600 mg, and manganese ascorbate 228-304 mg, in 2-3 divided doses daily for 2-6 months improves pain in patients with mild or moderate, but not severe, osteoarthritis when compared with placebo (4237, 7169). A different combination product (Gurukosamin & Kondoroichin, Suntory Wellness Ltd.) containing glucosamine hydrochloride 1200 mg, chondroitin sulfate 60 mg, and quercetin glycosides 45 mg, taken daily for 16 weeks, also seems to improve symptoms of knee osteoarthritis when compared with placebo (42514). It is unclear if the findings of any of these studies are due to glucosamine, chondroitin, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nDespite evidence suggesting differing benefit (89521, 94382), head-to-head comparisons of glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride are limited, and it is not universally acknowledged that these salts have different effectiveness profiles. One large clinical study in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking a specific product (Artrolive, Aché Laboratórios Farmacêuticos S.A.) containing glucosamine sulfate 500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 400 mg three times daily for 4 months seems to be no different for reducing pain when compared with taking glucosamine hydrochloride 500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 400 mg (Cosamin DS, Nutramax Laboratories, Inc.) three times daily (89520). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer. Many meta-analyses have pooled studies of both glucosamine salts together, producing largely inconsistent results (94381, 99683, 99685, 112444).\n\nExperts have conflicting stances on the use of glucosamine. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) strongly recommends against the use of any glucosamine products for any form of osteoarthritis (102114). Conversely, the European Society of Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) strongly recommends the use of pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate products, such as Dona (Rotta Pharmaceuticals), in patients with osteoarthritis. Additionally, the ESCEO provides a weak recommendation against the use of glucosamine in combination with chondroitin (102141). These differing recommendations seem to be related to interpretation of the evidence for pharmaceutical-grade products. The ACR has determined that the inconsistent evidence may indicate the presence of industry bias; the ESCEO has determined that the inconsistent evidence is due to inconsistent product quality.\n\nLimited research has found mixed benefit of using glucosamine on osteoarthritis of the SPINE, HIP, or HAND. In one study of patients with osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine, taking glucosamine sulfate (Dona, Rotta Pharmaceuticals) 1500 mg daily for 6 weeks reduced pain in more patients when compared with placebo (1316). However, in another study, using a different glucosamine sulfate product (Glucosamine Sulfate, PharmaNord) 1500 mg daily for 6 months did not reduce pain when compared with placebo (89562). In patients with hip osteoarthritis, taking glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg once daily for 2 years did not reduce symptoms or slow disease progression when compared with placebo (16717, 20100); however, there was a high rate of hip replacement, which may have confounded results (16717, 16718). In patients with erosive osteoarthritis of the hand, observational research has found that taking glucosamine sulfate (Dona, Rotta Pharmaceuticals) 1500 mg daily along with conventional therapy for 6 months is associated with reduced hand pain, a shorter duration of morning stiffness, and improved hand function when compared with conventional therapy alone (108897).\n\nLimited research has also evaluated INTRAMUSCULAR and TOPICAL glucosamine sulfate. A clinical study in patients with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis (radiological stage I-III) shows that giving intramuscular glucosamine sulfate 400 mg twice per week for 6 weeks reduces the severity of symptoms when compared with placebo (2605). There is also a small study showing that a topical preparation of glucosamine sulfate in combination with chondroitin sulfate, shark cartilage, and camphor reduces osteoarthritis symptoms when compared with placebo. However, any symptom relief is most likely due to the counterirritant effect of camphor and not the other ingredients (10327, 12467). There is no evidence that glucosamine is absorbed topically.\n\nGlucosamine sulfate does not seem to PREVENT osteoarthritis. Clinical studies in overweight healthy females aged 50-60 years shows that taking crystalline glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg orally daily for 2.5 years does not reduce the incidence of osteoarthritis after a 6-7 year follow-up; however, it may reduce the percentage of patients who experience knee joint space narrowing (95789, 97053).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. Topical N-acetyl glucosamine has only been evaluated in combination with niacinamide for reducing hyperpigmentation and liver skin spots on aging skin; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA clinical study in females ages 40-60 years with skin hyperpigmentation and solar lentigines (liver spots) primarily due to aging and sun exposure shows that applying a cream containing 2% N-acetyl glucosamine and 4% niacinamide to the face twice daily with sunscreen for 10 weeks decreases facial hyperpigmentation when compared with sunscreen alone (92721). The effect of N-acetyl glucosamine alone is unclear.\nless\nAromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. Oral glucosamine sulfate has only been evaluated in combination with chondroitin; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small open-label clinical study in patients with aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia shows that taking a combination of glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 1200 mg in 2-3 divided doses daily for 24 weeks improves pain when compared to baseline in postmenopausal adults with early stage breast cancer (89561). The validity of this finding is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nBack pain. Although there is interest in using oral glucosamine for back pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of glucosamine for this condition.\nCancer. Some low-quality observational studies have inconsistently found that glucosamine may be associated with a lower risk of different cancers; however, better quality evidence is needed.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that use of glucosamine with or without chondroitin is associated with a 7% to 12% lower risk of cancer when compared with no use of glucosamine. A subgroup analysis showed a reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer, but not other types of cancer (110625).\n\nObservational research report conflicting relationships between glucosamine and cancer. Some observational research in adults in the United Kingdom has found that taking glucosamine is associated with 4% higher risk of cancer over a median follow up for 13 years. However, a subgroup analysis showed a reduction in the risk of lung cancer (110627). Other observational research in adults in the United Kingdom has found that taking glucosamine is associated with a 5% reduced risk of cancer mortality over a median follow-up of around 12 years, with reductions specifically occurring in those with kidney, lung, and rectal cancers. However, glucosamine use was not linked to a reduced risk of mortality due to bladder, brain, breast, colon, ovarian, prostate, skin, stomach, thyroid, or uterine cancer (109645). Other large, propensity-score-adjusted, observational research in adults with osteoarthritis in the United Kingdom suggests that treatment with glucosamine, with an average of 8 years of follow-up, is not associated with a reduction in cancer, including lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer, when compared with patients not prescribed glucosamine (114571).\n\nThese studies are limited by observational designs, which also did not clarify the form of glucosamine used, or the dose, frequency, or duration of use. Furthermore, the adults that reported glucosamine use also reported overall healthier lifestyle habits than those that were not taking glucosamine. Although some studies attempted to control for these differences, higher quality, prospective research is needed to clarify the relationship, if any, between glucosamine and the risk for cancer and/or cancer-related mortality.\n\nOf note, some researchers have called into question the results from observational research linking glucosamine use to a lower rate of cancer, claiming that these studies suffer from a high risk of selection bias (109646).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral glucosamine prevents fatal or non-fatal CVD events.\nSome observational research of adults in the United Kingdom has found that taking glucosamine is associated with an overall 15% reduced risk for fatal and non-fatal CVD events, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (99682). However, this study did not clarify the form of glucosamine used, or the dose, frequency, or duration of use. Furthermore, the adults that reported glucosamine use also reported overall healthier lifestyle habits than those that were not taking glucosamine. Conversely, an observational study in Chinese patients with osteoarthritis has found that glucosamine use is associated with a 10% increase in the risk of CVD events and a 12% increase in the risk of CHD, with no increase in the risk of stroke. The risk for these outcomes was greatest in patients with higher adherence to glucosamine and in those taking larger doses (109642). However, this study also did not clarify the form of glucosamine used or provide specifics related to the frequency or duration of use. Furthermore, glucosamine users were generally older, more likely to be on antihyperlipidemic or antiplatelet therapy, and more likely to have multiple comorbidities compared with non-users. Both studies attempted to control for the differences in characteristics between glucosamine users and non-users; despite this, higher quality, prospective research is needed to clarify the relationship, if any, between glucosamine and CVD risk.\nless\nColorectal adenoma. Oral glucosamine has only been evaluated in combination with chondroitin; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn observational study in older adults has found that taking glucosamine and chondroitin is associated with a 26% reduced risk of high-risk adenoma and 10% reduced risk of conventional adenoma when compared with not using these supplements. This benefit was not seen in a subgroup of younger females (104444). This study did not clarify the form of glucosamine used, or the dose, frequency, or duration of use.\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral glucosamine reduces the risk of colorectal cancer.\nA meta-analysis of observational research has found that use of glucosamine with or without chondroitin is associated with a 7% to 12% lower risk of cancer when compared with no use of glucosamine. A subgroup analysis showed a reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer, but not other types of cancer (110625). However, not all research agrees. A large, observational study in adults has found that regular use of oral glucosamine is not associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer over a median of 7 years of follow-up, regardless of sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (108018). Other large, propensity-score-adjusted, observational research in adults with osteoarthritis in the United Kingdom suggests that treatment with glucosamine, with an average of 8 years of follow-up, is not associated with a reduction in cancer, including colorectal cancer, when compared with patients not prescribed glucosamine (114571).These studies did not clarify the form or dose of glucosamine used or the frequency or duration of use.\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral glucosamine is beneficial for COVID-19.\nA large observational study in adults suggests that regular glucosamine use over a median of 1.7 years is not linked to a lower odds of COVID-19 infection but is associated with a 20% lower risk of hospital admission and a 19% lower risk of mortality due to COVID-19 when compared with adults not using glucosamine (111649). This study did not clarify the form or dose of glucosamine used or the frequency or duration of use.\nless\nDementia. Observational studies suggest that long-term, regular glucosamine intake might reduce the risk of developing certain types of dementia.\nAn observational study has found that regularly taking glucosamine for an average of 8.9 years is associated with a 19% lower risk of developing dementia, including Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia (110630). Another large observational study in older adults without dementia suggests that regularly taking glucosamine for a median of 12 years is associated with an 18% lower risk of vascular dementia. However, habitual glucosamine consumption is not associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease or frontotemporal dementia (112461).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if oral glucosamine hydrochloride reduces depression symptoms.\nA small, open-label clinical trial in patients with unipolar depression shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride 1 gram daily for 1 week, followed by 2 grams daily for 3 weeks, reduces scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) by 31% or 33% when compared to baseline. However, only 20% of patients experienced a 50% or greater reduction in HAM-D scores, and there were no improvements in Clinical Global Impression scores (103281). The lack of a control group limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral glucosamine reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults.\nObservational research in adults in the United Kingdom has found that glucosamine use is associated with a 17% lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The relationship between glucosamine use and diabetes appears to be even more pronounced in patients with high baseline levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation (103234). However, this study did not clarify the form of glucosamine used, or the dose, frequency, or duration of use. Furthermore, the adults that reported glucosamine use also reported overall healthier lifestyle habits than those that were not taking glucosamine. Although this study attempted to control for these differences, higher quality, prospective research is needed to clarify the relationship, if any, between glucosamine and the risk for diabetes.\nless\nGout. It is unclear if oral glucosamine reduces the risk of developing gout.\nObservational research in adults in the United Kingdom has found that glucosamine use is associated with a 19% lower risk of gout in females, but not males (109644). However, this study did not clarify the form of glucosamine used, or the dose, frequency, or duration of use. Furthermore, the adults that reported glucosamine use also reported overall healthier lifestyle habits than those that were not taking glucosamine. Although this study attempted to control for these differences, higher quality, prospective research is needed to clarify the relationship, if any, between glucosamine and the risk for gout.\nless\nHeart failure. It is unclear if oral glucosamine prevents heart failure.\nA large, prospective observational study in adults without heart failure suggests that taking glucosamine regularly over a median of 9 years is associated with a 13% lower risk of developing heart failure when compared with adults not taking glucosamine (111646). This study did not clarify the form or dose of glucosamine used or the frequency or duration of use.\nless\nHyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral glucosamine hydrochloride improves hyperlipidemia when used with conventional medicine.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that glucosamine hydrochloride does not reduce cholesterol or triglyceride levels in patients with hyperlipidemia. A small crossover study in older adults taking simvastatin or atorvastatin shows that adding a specific glucosamine hydrochloride product (Artrox, Pfizer) 750 mg twice daily for 4 weeks does not seem to affect lipid levels when compared with placebo (18341).\nless\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is unclear if oral or rectal N-acetyl glucosamine improves symptoms of IBD in children.\nA very small clinical study in children ages 8-17 years with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis that were unresponsive to conventional treatment suggests that oral or rectal N-acetyl glucosamine 1.5-2 grams in 10 mL water twice daily for 6 weeks might decrease symptoms of IBD when compared with baseline (10234). The validity of this finding is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nInterstitial cystitis. Oral glucosamine sulfate has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nAn open-label clinical study in patients with interstitial cystitis shows that taking a specific product (CystoProtek, Tischon Corporation) containing glucosamine sulfate 120 mg, sodium hyaluronate 10 mg, chondroitin sulfate 150 mg, quercetin 150 mg, and rutin 20 mg per capsule, as two capsules twice daily for 12 months, reduces symptom severity by up to 52% when compared with baseline (42391). The validity of this finding is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nJoint pain. Oral glucosamine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in patients with joint pain shows that taking capsules of a specific combination product (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital) containing glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg, methylsulfonylmethane 500 mg, white willow bark extract 250 mg, ginger root concentrate 50 mg, Boswellia serrata extract 125 mg, turmeric root extract 50 mg, cayenne 40 m H.U. 50 mg, and hyaluronic acid 4 mg, daily in three divided doses for 8 weeks, reduces joint pain severity by 37% compared to only 16% with placebo. However, the specific combination product does not appear to improve joint stiffness or function compared with placebo (89560).\nless\nKashin-Beck disease. It is unclear if oral glucosamine hydrochloride improves Kashin-Beck Disease symptoms such as pain.\nA small clinical study in Chinese adults with Kashin-Beck Disease shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride 480 mg three times daily along with chondroitin sulfate 600 mg twice daily for 6 months decreases pain scores by at least 20% to 50% in more patients when compared with placebo. Taking glucosamine alone had a non-significant trend toward pain reduction in these patients (42516). An open-label study in Chinese adults with Kashin-Beck Disease shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride 750 mg twice daily for 6 weeks seems to be no different for improving pain and physical function when compared with taking to diclofenac 50 mg twice daily or naproxen 300 mg twice daily (18339). The validity of this finding is limited by a lack of blinding.\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Oral glucosamine might reduce the risk of developing kidney stones.\nA large observational study in adults without kidney stones suggests that regularly taking glucosamine is associated with a 28% lower risk of new-onset kidney stones in people with a total sedentary time under 3.5 hours daily. This association follows a dose-dependent relationship. However, regular glucosamine use does not seem to reduce the risk of new-onset kidney stones in people with total sedentary time exceeding 3.5 hours daily (112451).\nless\nKnee pain. Small clinical studies suggest that oral glucosamine hydrochloride might improve exercise-induced knee pain and chronic knee pain. However, it is unclear if glucosamine sulfate, N-acetyl glucosamine, or lower doses of glucosamine hydrochloride are beneficial in these patients.\nA small clinical study in athletes following an acute knee injury shows that taking glucosamine sulfate 500 mg three times daily for 28 days does not improve pain but might modestly improve mobility when compared with placebo (20103).\n\nAdditionally, a small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate meniscal tears shows that taking a combination product containing glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg , collagen peptides, hydrolyzed collagen type II, chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, methylsulfonylmethane, and other ingredients (Naturagen 4 Joint, Naturagen) daily for 8 weeks improves some assessments of pain and function but does not improve objective measures, including leg strength, balance, or stair climbing time, when compared with placebo (116134). It is unclear if these effects are due to glucosamine, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nGlucosamine has also been evaluated for chronic knee pain. A small clinical study in patients with chronic knee pain of unclear origin shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride 2000 mg daily for 12 weeks might modestly improve pain when compared with placebo (10312). However, lower doses of glucosamine hydrochloride and N-acetyl glucosamine used in combination with other ingredients have not demonstrated benefit for chronic knee pain. A small clinical trial in Japanese adults over 40 with knee pain shows that taking a combination supplement with glucosamine hydrochloride and other ingredients for 16 weeks does not improve pain, function, or walking speed when compared with placebo. The combination supplement provided glucosamine hydrochloride 1200 mg, chondroitin sulfate 60 mg, type II collagen peptides 45 mg, quercetin glycosides 90 mg, imidazole peptides 10 mg, and vitamin D 200 IU daily (95784). Another small clinical study in Japanese patients over 50 years of age with chronic knee pain shows that taking a specific supplement (Walker's Glucosamine, Kyowa) containing N-acetyl glucosamine 100 mg and chondroitin sulfate 180 mg daily for 24 weeks does not reduce pain or improve knee function when compared with placebo (95795).\nless\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is unclear if oral glucosamine is beneficial in patients with MASLD.\nObservational research in adults with MASLD and type 2 diabetes suggests that regular use of glucosamine orally for an average follow up of 11 years is associated with a lower risk of adverse liver outcomes when compared with those not regularly using glucosamine. Non-users of glucosamine had 35% to 44% higher risk of cirrhosis, encephalopathy, and esophageal varices. This study did not report the glucosamine dose or frequency (114573).\nless\nMultiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral glucosamine sulfate is beneficial in patients with MS.\nA small clinical study in patients with MS shows that taking glucosamine sulfate 1000 mg once daily for 6 months modestly reduces relapse when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo (20104).\nless\nOverall mortality. It is unclear if oral glucosamine reduces overall mortality.\nAn observational study in the United States has found that regular use of oral glucosamine, with or without chondroitin, for an average of 8 years is associated with a 30% lower risk of mortality when compared with no glucosamine use. However, when adjusted for covariates such as age, body-mass index, and comorbidities, there was no difference in overall mortality (110626).\n\nIn contrast, a cross-sectional observational study has found that using oral glucosamine and chondroitin for at least one year is associated with 27% reduced incidence of overall mortality and 58% reduced incidence of cardiovascular mortality when compared with not using these supplements (104445). This study did not clarify the form of glucosamine used, or the dose, frequency, or duration of use. Furthermore, the adults that reported glucosamine and chondroitin use also reported overall healthier lifestyle habits than those that were not taking glucosamine and chondroitin. Although this study attempted to control for these differences, higher quality, prospective research is needed to clarify the relationship, if any, with overall mortality.\n\nOf note, some researchers have called into question the results from observational research linking glucosamine use to a lower rate of overall mortality, claiming that these studies suffer from a high risk of selection bias (109646).\nless\nPostoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral glucosamine sulfate improves recovery after surgery.\nA small clinical study in male athletes who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction shows that taking glucosamine sulfate (Solgar Inc.) 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve rehabilitation outcomes such as functional ability, pain, and muscular performance when compared with placebo (95584).\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral glucosamine hydrochloride is beneficial in patients with RA.\nA small clinical study in patients with RA shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride tablets (Rohto Pharmaceutical Co.) 500 mg three times daily by mouth for 12 weeks reduces pain, but not the number of painful or swollen joints, when compared with placebo (17407).\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if oral glucosamine is beneficial for reducing stroke risk.\nAn observational cohort study of adults in the United Kingdom found that taking glucosamine is associated with a modest 9% reduced risk for overall stroke; however, sub-analyses show that glucosamine use is not associated with a reduced risk for fatal or non-fatal stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or ischemic stroke (99682). This study did not clarify the form of glucosamine used, or the dose, frequency, or duration of use. Furthermore, the adults that reported glucosamine use also reported overall healthier lifestyle habits than those that were not taking glucosamine. A case-control study in Spanish patients found that glucosamine use is associated with 45% lower odds of ischemic stroke when compared with non-use; however, the benefit was only observed in patients taking glucosamine for 1 year or less (109643). This study did not clarify the form of glucosamine used or the dose or frequency of use. Furthermore, patients in the control group were generally healthier and less likely to have a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia. Although both studies attempted to control for differences between patient populations, higher quality, prospective research is needed to clarify the relationship, if any, between glucosamine and stroke risk.\nless\nWound healing. Although there is interest in using topical glucosamine for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of glucosamine for this condition.\nTemporomandibular disorders (TMD). It is unclear if oral glucosamine sulfate is beneficial in patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis.\nA small and low-quality clinical study in patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis shows that taking glucosamine sulfate 500 mg three times daily for 90 days seems to be no different than taking ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily for relieving pain and improving functional abilities such as chewing, yawning, talking, and laughing (3714). However, another small clinical study in patients with the same condition shows that taking glucosamine sulfate 1200 mg daily for 6 weeks does not improve pain or jaw opening capacity when compared with placebo (20105).\n\nGlucosamine sulfate has also been evaluated in combination with chondroitin for this condition. A meta-analysis of two small clinical studies in patients with TMD shows that taking glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 1200 mg daily for 2 months does not reduce pain or increase maximum mouth opening when compared with tramadol 50-100 mg daily (109647). Other meta-analyses have reported similar results, however, these analyses may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups (114572). Another small clinical trial in children aged 10-13 years with class II malocclusion shows that application of a specific combination gel product containing glucosamine, chondroitin, and essential oils (Jointace Gel, Vitabiotics) with an expander device, twice daily for 3 months does not improve temporomandibular space measures or pain or tension scores, when compared with placebo (110629).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate glucosamine for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGlucosamine sulfate or hydrochloride has most commonly been used in single or divided daily doses of 1500 mg for up to 3 years.

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nGlucosamine hydrochloride is a naturally occurring salt and is obtained by simple extraction. On the other hand, glucosamine sulfate is a more complex ingredient, and is obtained by a semi-synthetic route and stabilization process. Glucosamine has been obtained from the exoskeletons of shellfish, including shrimp, lobster, and crabs. It can also be obtained from Aspergillus and fermented corn (102141).\n\nThere is great variability among glucosamine and glucosamine plus chondroitin products. An analysis of 14 products commercially available in the US found that actual content versus labeled content varies from 0% to 115% (8128). An analysis of 25 glucosamine and chondroitin supplement products available in Europe found that more than half of the tested products contained less than 90% of the labeled content (102116). Some products in the US that are labeled glucosamine sulfate are actually glucosamine hydrochloride with added sulfate (12464). Intravenous, intramuscular, and intra-articular products are available in some countries (2601); however, these products are not available in the US.\n\nGlucosamine sulfate itself is unstable and must be stabilized with a salt moiety.

Some research suggests that the sulfate portion of glucosamine sulfate might contribute to its effect in osteoarthritis. Since acetaminophen metabolism requires sulfur and reduces serum sulfate concentrations, acetaminophen could theoretically interfere with the action of glucosamine sulfate. Conversely, the administration of sulfate could theoretically decrease the effectiveness of acetaminophen in sulfate-deficient people by increasing its clearance (10313).\nless\nANTIDIABETES DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nDespite initial concerns, it is unlikely that glucosamine will interfere with the effects of antidiabetes drugs.\nIn vitro and animal research has suggested that glucosamine might increase insulin resistance or decrease insulin production (371, 372, 3406, 18342, 18343). This has raised concerns that taking glucosamine might worsen diabetes and decrease the effectiveness of diabetes drugs. However, clinical research suggests that glucosamine does not have adverse effects on blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) in healthy, obese, or type 2 diabetes patients (7026, 7075, 8942, 10311, 10317, 15111).\nless\nTOPOISOMERASE II INHIBITORS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically glucosamine may induce resistance to topoisomerase II inhibitors.\nIn vitro research suggests that glucosamine might induce resistance to etoposide (VP16, VePesid) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin) by reducing inhibition of topoisomerase II, an enzyme required for DNA replication in tumor cells (7639). This effect has not been reported in humans.\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nGlucosamine might increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and increase the risk of bruising and bleeding.\nIn two individual case reports, glucosamine/chondroitin combinations were associated with a significant increase in international normalized ratio (INR) in patients previously stabilized on warfarin (11389, 16130). In one case, the increase in INR occurred only after tripling the dose of a glucosamine/chondroitin supplement from 500 mg/400 mg daily to 1500/1200 mg daily (16130). Additionally, 20 voluntary case reports to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) have linked glucosamine plus chondroitin with increased INR, bruising, and bleeding in patients who were also taking warfarin (16130). There have also been 20 additional case reports to the World Health Organization (WHO) that link glucosamine alone to increased INR in patients taking warfarin (16131). The mechanism of this interaction is unclear. Glucosamine is a small component of heparin, but is not thought to have anticoagulant activity; however, animal research suggests that it might have antiplatelet activity (16131).\nless",
            "Interactions with Supplements": "CHONDROITIN SULFATE\nTheoretically, concomitant use of glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate may reduce the absorption of glucosamine hydrochloride.\nClinical research shows that taking a single dose of chondroitin sulfate in combination with glucosamine hydrochloride reduces the maximal blood concentration (Cmax) of glucosamine. When a single dose of glucosamine hydrochloride is taken following 3 months of combined glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate supplementation, the Cmax is not affected; however, the AUC is reduced (42444). The clinical significance of this interaction is unclear.\nless",
            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nASTHMA\nGlucosamine might exacerbate asthma. The mechanism of this allergic risk is unknown. Use cautiously in patients with asthma (10002).\nless\nDIABETES\nDespite previous concerns, it is unlikely that glucosamine will interfere with glycemic control in diabetes. Some preliminary research and case reports have raised concerns that glucosamine sulfate might increase insulin resistance or decrease insulin production, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels (22, 371, 372, 1203, 3406, 5059, 7637, 14810). However, clinical studies show that various forms of glucosamine do not have adverse effects on blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) in healthy, obese patients with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance when used for up to 3 years (7026, 7075, 7638, 8942, 10311, 10317, 12107, 14808, 15111, 89563).\nless\nGLAUCOMA\nThere is some concern that taking glucosamine sulfate might increase intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. Two retrospective chart analyses found that patients with poorly controlled glaucoma who discontinued glucosamine experienced a decrease in intraocular pressure of about 3 mmHg (89573, 94623). A clinical study also found that 34% of patients taking glucosamine sulfate 750 mg three times daily for 3 months experienced a clinically meaningful increase in intraocular pressure of at least 2 mmHg, compared to only 13% of patients taking placebo (94624). Data from the FDA MedWatch adverse event reporting system shows that 0.21% of subjects taking glucosamine reported glaucoma, which is significantly greater than the 0.08% of subjects who reported glaucoma while using any other drug (112460). Patients with severe glaucoma should avoid glucosamine sulfate. Patients with mild-to-moderate glaucoma should be monitored for changes in intraocular pressure.\nless\nHYPERLIPIDEMIA\nDespite previous concerns, it is unlikely that glucosamine will affect lipid or triglyceride levels. Some preliminary research has suggested that glucosamine might increase insulin levels. Hyperinsulinemia is associated with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides (5059, 7075). Animal model research has also shown that glucosamine might exacerbate hyperlipidemia (15110). But research in humans has not shown this effect. Glucosamine does not seem to increase lipid levels in people over age 40 who take glucosamine sulfate for up to 3 years (7026, 8942).\nless\nHYPERTENSION\nDespite previous concerns, it is unlikely that glucosamine increases blood pressure. Some preliminary research has suggested that glucosamine might increase insulin levels. Hyperinsulinemia is associated with elevated blood pressure (5059, 7075). But research in humans has not shown this effect. Glucosamine does not seem to increase blood pressure in people over age 45 who take glucosamine sulfate for up to 3 years (7026, 8942).\nless\nSHELLFISH ALLERGY\nThere is concern that glucosamine products might cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to shellfish. Glucosamine is derived from the exoskeletons of shrimp, lobster, and crabs. Allergic reactions in people with shellfish allergy are caused by IgE antibodies to antigens in the meat of shellfish, not to antigens in the exoskeleton. However, a review of glucosamine-related adverse events in Australia found that 72% of all reports involved hypersensitivity reactions. It is unclear from this report if these patients had a shellfish allergy; however, the reactions were similar to those seen in shellfish allergy. It is possible that allergen contamination can occur during the manufacture of some glucosamine products (102115).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with glucosamine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nGlucosamine is absorbed from the small intestine (2607). The maximum concentration (Cmax) of glucosamine in plasma proteins in healthy adults following oral intake of glucosamine sulfate was 31 mcM/L, while after intravenous and intramuscular administration it was about 130 mcM/L (2607). Bioavailability after intramuscular administration of glucosamine sulfate was about 96% compared to about 26% with oral glucosamine, indicating significant first-pass metabolism of glucosamine by the liver (2607, 2608). Clinical research shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride by mouth results in a Cmax of 492-944 ng/mL and a Tmax of 2.3-3.3 hours. When glucosamine hydrochloride is taken with chondroitin, the Cmax of 492 was reduced to 311 ng/mL (42444, 89554).\n\nOral ingestion of a specific glucosamine sulfate product (Dona, Rottapharm Group) 1500 mg once daily for 14 days produced plasma glucosamine levels of 1282 ng/mL (16716). Some research suggests that glucosamine bioavailability depends on the individual patient rather than on the supplement formulation. A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that taking Dona (Rottapharm Group) powder sachets 1500 mg daily for 6 days does not have different pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters than a generic glucosamine sulfate supplement (Blackmores) 1500 mg daily; however, there was notable variability in intra-individual PK parameters. Other research suggests that bioavailability might vary modestly with different supplement formulations. The Cmax of a powder-filled glucosamine sulfate was 543.12 ng/mL at one 1 hour; while the timed-release glucosamine sulfate (TimeOsamine) Cmax was 520.98 ng/mL at about 4 hours (89584). A small clinical study suggests that glucosamine sulfate in a capsule with sodium chloride is bioequivalent to a capsule with potassium chloride (89571).\nDistribution\nGlucosamine is incorporated into plasma proteins during first-pass metabolism, and unbound glucosamine is concentrated in the articular cartilage (2608). Free glucosamine is undetectable in the plasma (2607). In plasma proteins, the terminal half-life of glucosamine sulfate was 70 hours following intravenous administration, 57 hours following intramuscular administration, and 68 hours following oral administration, in healthy males (2607). The volume of distribution after intravenous administration of glucosamine sulfate in humans has been reported as 71 mL/kg (89586). Oral ingestion of a specific glucosamine sulfate product (Dona, Rottapharm Group) 1500 mg once daily for 14 days produced synovial fluid glucosamine levels of 777 ng/mL (16716).\nMetabolism\nGlucosamine sulfate is extensively metabolized in the liver (2607). A significant amount is catabolized by first-pass metabolism in the liver and ultimately converted to carbon dioxide, water, and urea (2607).\nExcretion\nGlucosamine is thought to be excreted mainly in the urine (89556). However, some may also be excreted in the feces, or metabolized to carbon dioxide and excreted in expired air (89586). The plasma level of glucosamine sulfate administered intravenously falls rapidly, with an initial half-life of 6.1 minutes and a terminal half-life of 2.1 hours (89586). Larger doses exhibited a beta-elimination half-life of 120-150 minutes (89556). In adult males, the average half-life of oral glucosamine hydrochloride was about 1.1-1.5 hours (89554). Glucosamine is thought to be excreted mainly in the urine (89556). Elimination may be delayed in cases of renal insufficiency (89525).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGlucosamine is an amino sugar (89513). N-acetyl glucosamine is the acetylated derivative of the amino sugar glucosamine, which is a constituent of cartilage proteoglycans. Glucosamine is required for the synthesis of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans (also known as mucopolysaccharides). These carbohydrate-containing compounds are found in tendons, ligaments, cartilage, synovial fluid, mucous membranes, structures in the eye, blood vessels, and heart valves. Glucosamine is also a component of biologically active compounds such as heparin, but it does not react with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies (7640, 7641, 11831). Glucosamine is usually derived from marine exoskeletons or produced synthetically (89513).\n\nGlucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetyl glucosamine are the major salt forms of glucosamine. Although glucosamine is administered in a salt form, the salt is likely cleaved off in the stomach. Glucosamine base is completely ionized in the stomach. Laboratory data suggests that glucosamine base, glucosamine hydrochloride, and glucosamine sulfate may be equally active, but there are no head-to-head clinical studies (8128).\nAnti-arthritic effects\nAs sulfate is required for articular cartilage glycosaminoglycan synthesis, some researchers think the sulfate moiety in glucosamine sulfate might be responsible for its effect on osteoarthritis and the additional glucosamine might increase the absorption of sulfate. It has been shown that glucosamine sulfate increases serum and synovial sulfate levels. However, acetaminophen given concurrently with glucosamine sulfate, decreases sulfate levels, suggesting that use of acetaminophen in clinical trials might alter results. If the sulfate is the active moiety of glucosamine sulfate, theoretically glucosamine hydrochloride would be less effective (10313). More research is needed to determine the role of sulfate in the efficacy of glucosamine sulfate.\n\nSome clinical evidence suggests that glucosamine might have a disease-modifying effect, stopping or slowing the progression of osteoarthritis (7026). Preliminary research suggests that glucosamine inhibits protein N-glycosylation and cytokine-stimulated production of mediators of inflammation and cartilage degradation (9119, 89526). Glucosamine seems to inhibit interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta), which stimulates the gene expression and protein synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (9121, 89582). But glucosamine doesn't seem to directly affect cyclooxygenase, which is responsible for anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as adverse gastrointestinal effects (2604). Preliminary research also shows that glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13); these metalloproteinases have been associated with arthritis disease progression (89574, 89582).\n\nIn animals, glucosamine has been shown to decrease CTX-II, a marker of type II collagen degradation, and increase CPII, a marker of type II collagen synthesis (89526). In healthy college athletes, taking glucosamine hydrochloride 2000 mg daily within 30 minutes of exercise for 16 weeks decreased serum and urine levels of CTX-II when compared with placebo, indicating suppression of collagen degradation (99686). Glucosamine is found in the structure of proteoglycan aggregates that allows cartilage to be elastic (95584). Some preliminary evidence in vitro suggests that glucosamine sulfate may also stimulate the synthesis of cartilage precursors, including proteoglycans (89576) and glycosaminoglycans (89580). Also, in mesenchymal stem cells in culture taken from normal donors and patients with arthritis, chondroitin and glucosamine have been shown to enhance chondrogenesis (42374). In vitro, glucosamine appears to increase the expression of the cartilage-specific genes aggrecan and collagen type II, reducing collagen type I mRNA in chondrocytes; the IL-1beta-induced shift in gene expression was also antagonized (89544). However, other research in animal models show that glucosamine may actually stimulate the loss of small proteoglycans from ligament explant cultures, although it does not seem to affect joint capsule or tendon or large proteoglycan catabolism in ligament, tendon, or synovial capsule (89545).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGlucosamine itself and glucosamine sulfate have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in animal and in vitro models (89526, 89534, 89535, 89579, 89580, 89581). Possible mechanisms of action have been explored in vitro and in animal models and include decreased expression of IL-1beta in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner (89537), inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-mediated phosphorylation of JNK and ERK (89538), downregulated cyclooxygenase-2 and MMP-13 expression in IL-1beta- or PMA-treated cells (89539), inhibited degranulation of mast cells (89534), and increased hyaluronic acid production (89540). Other mechanisms of action, as shown in vitro, include noncompetitive inhibition of basal glucose transport, membrane translocation of GLUT1 and 6 (and not GLUT3), and hyaluronan and SGAG synthesis (89541), as well as inhibition of NF-kappaB by inhibiting IKK kinase activity (89542), increased chaperone GRP78 and decreased superoxide dismutase (89575), and involvement of the p38 MAPK and Akt signaling pathways (89543).\nAnti-viral effects\nIn vitro research suggests that glucosamine sulfate has activity against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), possibly by inhibiting the intracellular viral movement and blocking viral replication (7642).\n\nIn vitro research also suggests that prophylactic treatment with D-glucosamine appears to inhibit replication of the novel human coronavirus, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Researchers suggest that glucosamine induces interferon types I and III by increasing phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). The increase in interferons decreases the expression of the coronavirus spike protein. Further investigation of the antiviral activity of glucosamine indicates that the spectrum of activity is similar to ribavirin, suggesting a broad spectrum of activity. These findings were further investigated in an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which found that glucosamine treatment reduces SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lungs and trachea and alleviates lung inflammation (111648).\nAnticancer effects\nIn epidemiological research, use of glucosamine and chondroitin was associated with a reduced risk of lung and colorectal cancer (89524). However, other human research has suggested that only certain populations, such as individuals that have not been screened for colorectal cancer, may benefit from glucosamine supplementation (108018). Potential anti-cancer mechanisms of action are not clear. However, they may include inhibited cross-linking activity of transglutaminase-2 and reversed transglutaminase-2-mediated NF-kappaB polymerization (89529); inhibition of IL-1beta mediated IL-8 production by inhibition of MAP kinase (89530), STAT3 signaling (89531), and protein translation (89532); and stimulation of autophagic cell death through the endoplasmic reticulum stress manifested by the induction of BiP, IRE1alpha, and phospho-eIF2alpha expression (89533).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn vitro research also suggests that prophylactic treatment with D-glucosamine appears to inhibit replication of the novel human coronavirus, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Researchers suggest that glucosamine induces interferon types I and III by increasing phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). The increase in interferons decreases the expression of the coronavirus spike protein. Further investigation of the antiviral activity of glucosamine indicates that the spectrum of activity is similar to ribavirin, suggesting a broad spectrum of activity. These findings were further investigated in an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which found that glucosamine treatment reduces SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the lungs and trachea and alleviates lung inflammation (111648).\nDermatologic effects\nGlucosamine may stimulate the synthesis of collagen and proteoglycans. These chemicals make up connective tissues such as skin. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking glucosamine sulfate 250 mg once daily for 8 weeks increased the expression of CD44 and collagen type IV, the epidermis glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans level, and collagen type I synthesis in the skin of healthy older volunteers. These marker changes are thought to exhibit improved skin aging parameters (95587). Also, in vitro research shows that N-acetyl glucosamine decreases melanin production, which could explain its ability to decrease age spots when applied topically to females with skin hyperpigmentation. N-acetyl glucosamine is believed to inhibit the glycosylation of tyrosinase, an important step in the formation of melanin (92721).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn an animal colitis model, glucosamine inhibits the activation of intestinal epithelial cells; the inhibition of NF-kappaB was implicated (89535). In human colonic epithelial HT-29 cells, glucosamine inhibited IL-8 production and ICAM-1 expression following TNF-alpha stimulation, as well as TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK and NF-kappaB p65, and the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in the cells (89550). These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of glucosamine hydrochloride may theoretically be useful for reducing inflammation associated with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Another theory is that in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), N-acetylation of glucosamine is relatively deficient, possibly reducing the synthesis of the gastric and intestinal mucosa's protective glycoprotein cover (2609). Theoretically, supplementation with N-acetyl glucosamine could remedy this deficiency and restore the glycoprotein cover (2609). However, there aren't any human studies that have evaluated this claim.\n\nThere is also interest in using glucosamine hydrochloride to modify the gut microbiota. A small clinical study in 11 healthy volunteers shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride 1500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 1200 mg daily for 14 days does not affect the concentration or quantity of the seven most common bacterial phyla found in the gut; however, it might alter the quantity of some bacterial genera when compared with placebo. It is unclear if these changes would affect gut health (102117). Another small clinical study shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride 3 grams daily for 3 weeks reduces bacterial diversity in the fecal flora in a beneficial manner and reduces amino acid excretion (106882).\nGlycemic effects\nThere has been concern about potential adverse metabolic effects of glucosamine. Preliminary evidence suggests glucosamine might decrease glucose-induced insulin secretion by inhibiting pancreatic glucokinase in the beta cells of the islet of Langerhans (22, 371, 372, 1203, 3406, 5059, 7637, 14810). Other preliminary research suggests that glucosamine might also impair insulin-mediated glucose uptake and metabolism in skeletal muscle (372, 3406). Animal research suggests glucosamine might increase glucose metabolism through the hexosamine pathway, a pattern of change in glucose metabolism similar to that seen in type 2 diabetes (3405, 3406). Animal models also suggest that glucosamine might exacerbate the hyperlipidemia caused by a high-fat Western diet (15110).\n\nHowever, animals may handle glucosamine differently than humans. Most of the research in humans suggests that glucosamine does not affect the pharmacokinetics of glucose. Research in people with normal glucose metabolism suggests glucosamine does not affect insulin sensitivity or plasma glucose (7637, 7638). Some preliminary research in humans has raised concerns that glucosamine might increase insulin resistance or decrease insulin production, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels and reduced glucose control in people with diabetes (22, 1203, 1204, 3405, 3406, 5059, 14810, 18342, 18343). However, most clinical research in healthy people and people with diabetes or obesity suggests glucosamine doesn't have any significant effect on blood glucose or lipid levels when taken for up to 3 years (7026, 7637, 7638, 8942, 10311, 10317, 12107, 14808, 15111). Preliminary clinical research suggests that endogenous glucosamine and insulin levels are elevated in nondiabetic patients with ischemic heart disease (7640, 7641). Some researchers think that increased glucosamine production might contribute to endothelial cell dysfunction (8944).\nImmunological effects\nIn animal research, glucosamine improves atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions by inhibiting Th2 cell development. Glucosamine also reduces infiltrated inflammatory mast cells and eosinophils, and levels of serum IgE and Th2 cytokines in spleen cells are reduced. In cell cultures, Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-5, significantly decrease after administration of glucosamine (89549).\nLipid effects\nAnimal models suggest that glucosamine might exacerbate the hyperlipidemia caused by a high-fat Western diet (15110). In contrast, in vitro evidence shows that glucosamine-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress attenuates apolipoprotein B100 synthesis via PERK signaling in hepatic cells (89547).\nOphthalmic effects\nGlucosamine has been investigated as a potential agent for the prevention and treatment of retinal pigment epithelial-mediated ocular proliferative disorders in vitro. In retinal pigment epithelial cells, glucosamine inhibits epidermal growth factor-induced proliferation and cell-cycle progression (89553)."

In a later study, kidney changes were determined to be incidental. The NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg, the highest dose tested.

The metabolism of glucuronolactone to glucaric acid occurs in hepatic cells (102612, 102614). In rodents, a small amount of glucuronolactone is metabolized to vitamin C (102621). At physiological pH, glucuronolactone is in equilibrium with glucuronic acid (102621).\nExcretion\nGlucuronolactone and its metabolites glucuronic acid and glucaric acid are excreted in urine within 24 to 48 hours of oral intake (102613).",

It is produced mainly in skeletal muscle and then released into the circulation for use by the immune system, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and liver (7729). Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid, meaning that humans require an exogenous source of glutamine when endogenous synthesis is unable to meet physiological and metabolic needs, such as during periods of severe catabolic stress or in cases of intestinal dysfunction. Since the human body is typically able to synthesize adequate quantities of glutamine, there is no recommended daily allowance (RDA) or adequate intake (AI) for this amino acid (94500).\n\nGlutamine should not be confused with glutamate (glutamic acid), a separate amino acid that acts as a neurotransmitter.

Glutamine has been safely incorporated into parenteral nutrition in doses up to 600 mg/kg daily in clinical trials (2363, 2366, 5448, 5452, 5453, 5454, 5458, 7293, 52272, 52275) (52283, 52289, 52304, 52306, 52316, 52341) (52359, 52360, 52371, 52377, 52381, 52284, 52385, 52408, 96637, 96507, 96516).\nCHILDREN: LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Glutamine has been shown to be safe in clinical research when used in amounts that do not exceed 0.7 grams/kg daily in children 1-18 years old (11364, 46657, 52321, 52323, 52363, 86095, 96517). A specific glutamine product (Endari) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for certain patients 5 years of age and older (96520). ...when used intravenously. Glutamine has been safely incorporated into parenteral nutrition in doses up to 0.4 grams/kg daily in clinical research (52338, 96508). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of glutamine when used in larger amounts in children.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of glutamine when used in larger amounts as medicine during pregnancy or lactation.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and intravenously, glutamine is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Belching, bloating, constipation, cough, diarrhea, flatulence, gastrointestinal pain, headache, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\nEndocrine\nOne case of hot flashes has been reported in a patient taking glutamine 5-15 grams orally twice daily for up to 1 year (96520).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, glutamine has been associated with belching, bloating, constipation, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal (GI) pain. Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and GI pain have been reported in clinical trials using high-dose glutamine 10-30 grams (0.3 grams/kg) in two divided doses daily to treat sickle cell disease (99414). One case of dyspepsia and one case of abdominal pain have been reported in patients taking glutamine 5-15 grams twice daily orally for up to 1 year (96520). In a small trial of healthy males, taking a single dose of about 60 grams (0.9 grams/kg of fat free body mass [FFM]) was associated with a 50% to 79% incidence of GI discomfort, nausea, and belching, compared with a 7% to 28% incidence with a lower dose of about 20 grams (0.3 gram/kg FFM). Flatulence, bloating, lower GI pain, and urge to regurgitate occurred at similar rates regardless of dose, and there were no cases of heartburn, vomiting, or diarrhea/constipation (105013). It is possible that certain GI side effects occur only after multiple doses of glutamine.\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, glutamine 30 grams daily has been associated with cases of musculoskeletal pain and non-cardiac chest pain in clinical trials for patients with sickle cell disease (99414).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, glutamine has been associated with dizziness and headache. A single case of dizziness has been reported in a patient treated with oral glutamine 0.5 grams/kg. However, the symptom resolved after reducing the dose to 0.25 grams/kg (91356). Mania and hypomania have been reported in 2 patients with bipolar disorder taking commercially purchased glutamine up to 4 grams daily (7291). Glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia, both of which might have neurological effects in people with neurological and psychiatric diseases or in people predisposed to hepatic encephalopathy (7293).\nless\nOncologic\nThere is some concern that glutamine might be used by rapidly growing tumors and possibly stimulate tumor growth. Although tumors may utilize glutamine and other amino acids, preliminary research shows that glutamine supplementation does not increase tumor growth (5469, 7233, 7738). In fact, there is preliminary evidence that glutamine might actually reduce tumor growth (5469).\nless\nOther\nOrally, glutamine has been associated with cough when a powdered formulation is used. It is unclear if this was due to accidental inhalation. One case of a burning sensation and one case of hypersplenism has been reported in a patient taking glutamine 5-15 grams twice daily orally for up to 1 year (96520).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nEFFECTIVE\nSickle cell disease. A specific oral glutamine powder (Endari, Emmaus Medical, Inc) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce acute complications of sickle cell disease.\nClinical research in adults and children 5 years of age and older with sickle cell disease shows that taking glutamine (Endari, Emmaus Medical) 5-15 grams (0.3 grams/kg body weight) orally twice daily for 48 weeks, either with or without hydroxyurea, delays the median time to first crisis by 30 days and reduces the incidence of acute chest syndrome by 15%, the annualized rate of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) by up to 45%, the number of hospitalizations by 33%, and the number of hospitalized days by 40% when compared with placebo (96519, 99414, 113706). Other research evaluating the same product and dosing regimen suggests that reductions in the annualized rate of VOC and hospitalization occur within 24 weeks of treatment and appear to continue for at least 72 weeks. The need for transfusion and hospitalization also remains reduced at 72 weeks (116101).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCritical illness (trauma). Oral and intravenous glutamine seem to reduce infectious complications in critically ill adults. However, glutamine does not seem to reduce mortality in this population.\nSome studies show that glutamine reduces the risk of infectious complications in critically ill, multiple-trauma, or postoperative adult patients (5449, 5450, 7309, 7731, 8184, 52288, 52359). However, other studies show no benefit (52308, 52360, 97362). Meta-analyses of these and other clinical trials suggest that glutamine supplementation reduces the risk of nosocomial infections in critically ill patients by 15% to 18% and the risk of nosocomial infections in surgical patients by 30% to 41%. This benefit was seen only with parenteral glutamine; enteral glutamine does not appear to reduce the risk for nosocomial infection (91355, 91358).\n\nThe role of glutamine for reducing mortality in critically ill adults is conflicting. Some clinical trials suggest that glutamine-enriched enteral and parenteral nutrition reduces mortality in critically ill patients (52283, 52289, 52408). However, other studies show no benefit (52288, 52308, 52354, 52359, 97362, 113702). Meta-analyses of results from these and other clinical trials show that, overall, taking glutamine does not reduce the risk of mortality in critically ill patients (91355, 91358). However, the dose and dosage form may affect outcomes. One meta-analysis shows that glutamine does not affect the risk of mortality when administered at doses up to 0.5 grams/kg daily, although doses greater than 0.5 grams/kg daily may INCREASE mortality by 18% (91355). Another meta-analysis shows that glutamine decreases short-term mortality in critically ill patients by 25% when administered parenterally, but not enterally (91358). Neither parenteral nor enteral glutamine appears to decrease the risk of long-term mortality in critically ill patients (91358).\n\nResearch evaluating glutamine in critically ill children is limited. One clinical study in children ages 1-17 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) shows that enteral administration of glutamine along with zinc, selenium, and intravenous metoclopramide does not reduce nosocomial infections when compared with whey supplementation (86095).\nless\nHIV/AIDS-related wasting. Oral glutamine seems to attenuate weight loss related to HIV/AIDS.\nVery small clinical studies show that taking glutamine orally seems to enhance intestinal absorption of nutrients, decrease intestinal permeability, and increase weight gain in adults with HIV/AIDS when compared with placebo. Doses of 40 grams daily seem to produce the greatest effect (2337, 2702). Lower doses of 14 grams daily might also be effective when used in combination with arginine and hydroxymethylbutyrate (a leucine metabolite) (7310).\nless\nPancreatitis. Clinical research shows that enteral or parental glutamine administration may reduce the risk of complications and duration of hospitalization in adults with severe acute pancreatitis.\nA meta-analysis of clinical studies including up to 1200 adults with severe acute pancreatitis requiring either enteral or parenteral nutritional support shows that adding either enteral or intravenous (IV) glutamine improves outcomes when compared with conventional nutritional support alone; however, benefits differed by route of administration. Sub-analyses found that IV and enteral glutamine reduce the relative risk of complications by 79% and 37%, respectively, and reduce the duration of hospitalization by 3 and 4 days, respectively. Enteral, but not IV, glutamine also seems to significantly reduces the risk of mortality (113686). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 5 clinical trials conducted in China in adults with severe acute pancreatitis and abdominal infection shows that IV glutamine combined with the IV antibiotic imipenem improves clinical signs and symptoms when compared with imipenem alone (113697). The interpretation of the results in this meta-analysis is limited by the poor description of study design and outcomes.\nless\nPostoperative recovery. Clinical research in adults hospitalized after abdominal surgery shows that postoperative enteral or parental glutamine administration may reduce the duration of hospitalization and improve postoperative nutritional status. The benefits of preoperative glutamine in adults scheduled for cardiac surgery is unclear.\nA meta-analysis of low- to moderate-quality clinical studies, primarily in critically ill adults who recently underwent gastrointestinal surgery, shows that intravenous (IV) administration of glutamine-containing dipeptides reduces the length of hospital stay by about 3 days, but does not reduce postoperative complications or mortality, when compared with no supplementation (96507). Additionally, a meta-analysis of up to 7 clinical studies, primarily in critically ill patients with recent abdominal surgery, shows that IV glutamine-containing dipeptides, providing 0.34-0.5 g/kg daily of glutamine for up to one month, reduces length of hospital stay by about 4 days and risk of infections by about 40%, but does not reduce mortality rates, when compared with control (103834). The validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity and lack of blinding.\n\nGlutamine has also been evaluated in adults undergoing surgery for colorectal or gastrointestinal cancer. One small clinical study suggests that IV glutamine can improve postoperative nutritional status and gastrointestinal function (100943). Meta-analyses of small, unblinded clinical trials in adults with recent radical surgery for colorectal cancer also shows that postoperative enteral or IV glutamine administration may reduce the length of hospital stay and improve some markers of nutritional status when compared with control (108033, 113701). Additionally, a retrospective cohort study of adults undergoing colorectal cancer surgery has found that IV glutamine administration is associated with a lower incidence of postoperative complications, shorter length of hospital stay, and improved gastrointestinal function when compared with control (113695).\n\nPre-operative glutamine supplementation, in combination with other ingredients, has been evaluated in adults undergoing cardiac surgeries. One clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product (Heallagen) containing glutamine 14 grams, L-arginine, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) daily for 1 month before cardiac surgery reduces the postoperative length of hospital and ICU stay by about one day when compared with placebo (110394). Likewise, a small, open-label clinical study in older adults undergoing cardiac surgery shows that taking a specific combination product (Abound, Abbott) containing glutamine 7 grams, L-arginine, and HMB once or twice daily for at least 14 days before surgery reduces the length of hospital stay by about 4 days and improves postoperative functional exercise capacity (116026). It is unclear if these effects are due to glutamine, other ingredients, or the combination.\n\nEvidence for the use of postoperative glutamine in children is limited. Small clinical studies in newborns and infants undergoing gastrointestinal surgery show that glutamine-fortified parenteral nutrition does not improve intestinal permeability, nitrogen balance, duration of hospitalization, incidence of infectious complications, or risk of mortality (52338, 96508).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAthletic performance. Oral glutamine does not seem to improve athletic performance.\nSmall studies in trained athletes or healthy adults show that taking glutamine orally does not seem to enhance performance or immune response during intense acute or prolonged exercise when compared with placebo (2341, 2342, 5455, 5456).\nless\nBurns. Clinical research shows that enteral glutamine does not reduce the risk of mortality or hospital length of stay in adults with severe burns. Evidence for the use of intravenous (IV) glutamine is inconclusive.\nAlthough small clinical studies, and meta-analyses of these small studies, suggest that enteral or parenteral glutamine may reduce the relative risk of mortality, infection, and duration of hospitalization in adults with severe burns (97363, 113691, 113700, 113703), one very large, high-quality randomized controlled trial has not supported this finding. This large clinical study, which enrolled 1200 adults with severe burns, shows that enteral glutamine 0.5 g/kg/day, starting within 72 hours after hospital admission and continuing for seven days after the last skin graft, does not reduce the risk of mortality or duration of hospitalization when compared with placebo (113685). Meta-analyses which incorporate this large, high-quality study have found no benefit with enteral glutamine; when this study is excluded from meta-analyses, enteral glutamine appears to reduce the relative risk of mortality by up to 90% (113700, 113703). However, these findings are drawn from small, lower quality studies which utilized heterogenous treatment regimens.\n\nOther research has evaluated the use of intravenous (IV) glutamine. One meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies in adults with severe burns, 3 of which utilized enteral glutamine and 3 of which utilized IV glutamine, shows that glutamine may reduce the relative risk of mortality, but not the risk of confirmed infection or duration of hospitalization, when compared with placebo (113691). However, there were no sub-analyses conducted to evaluate any potential differences with the use of IV versus enteral glutamine. The three individual clinical studies that utilized IV glutamine did not identify a reduction in infection risk or duration of hospitalization (108027, 116773, 116774).\nless\nCrohn disease. Oral glutamine does not seem to improve symptoms of this condition.\nSmall clinical studies in adults and children with Crohn disease show that taking glutamine 7 grams three times daily or following a glutamine-enriched diet for 4 weeks does not seem to improve intestinal permeability or disease activity, and might even worsen disease activity, when compared with placebo or a low-glutamine diet (2338, 6256).\nless\nCystinuria. Oral glutamine does not seem to improve cystinuria.\nAccording to case reports, taking glutamine orally does not seem to reduce the excretion of cysteine in the urine in patients with homozygous cystinuria (2339).\nless\nLow birth weight. Oral glutamine does not seem to reduce adverse consequences of low birth weight in infants.\nMost clinical studies show that glutamine supplementation does not improve the time to full enteral feeding, infant growth rate, or length of hospital stay in low birth weight infants (52305, 52312, 52325, 52342, 52362, 52410). One follow-up study also shows that neonatal glutamine supplementation is not associated with improvements in cognitive function, motor skills, or behavior outcomes by school age when corrected for neonatal infection rate (52342, 97365).\nless\nMuscular dystrophy. Oral glutamine does not seem to improve symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nClinical studies show that taking glutamine 0.5-0.6 grams/kg orally does not significantly improve muscle strength or whole body protein degradation in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy when compared with placebo or a nonspecific amino acid mixture (46657, 52363).\nless\nPrematurity. Oral glutamine does not seem to reduce morbidity or mortality associated with prematurity.\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in preterm infants, including infants with low to very low birth weight, shows that use of enteral or parenteral glutamine does not reduce the risk of mortality or morbidities, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, when compared with control. However, limited evidence from a sub-group analysis suggests that enteral glutamine might modestly reduce the risk of invasive infection when compared with control (105015). These findings are limited by the selection bias and heterogeneity of the included trials.\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. Oral glutamine does not seem to improve diarrhea due to radiation therapy.\nOne meta-analysis of five randomized, controlled trials shows that taking oral glutamine during radiotherapy for pelvic cancers does not prevent or reduce the severity of diarrhea when compared with placebo (97367).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAlcohol use disorder. Although there is interest in using oral glutamine for alcohol use disorder, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of glutamine for this condition.\nAntiretroviral-associated diarrhea. It is unclear if oral glutamine improves diarrhea caused by antiretroviral agents.\nA small crossover clinical study in HIV patients shows that oral glutamine 30 grams daily for 10 days seems to reduce the severity of nelfinavir-associated diarrhea when compared with placebo (52313).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there is interest in using oral glutamine for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of glutamine for this condition.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if dietary glutamine intake alters the risk of CVD or CVD-related mortality.\nTwo large observational studies in adults with type 2 diabetes has found that the highest habitual dietary intakes of glutamine over approximately 30 years of follow-up are associated with a lower relative risk of CVD incidence, CVD mortality, and total mortality by 12%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, when compared with the lowest intakes of glutamine (113699).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral or parenteral administration of glutamine reduces the incidence or severity of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.\nSmall clinical studies of adults receiving treatment with various types of chemotherapy, as well as a meta-analysis of these small studies, suggest that enteral or parenteral glutamine may modestly reduce the duration of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, with an estimated duration reduction of about one day (7235, 7285, 96516, 113694). However, it may not reduce the incidence of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (7233, 7295, 96516).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced leukopenia. It is unclear if oral glutamine reduces leukopenia caused by chemotherapy.\nOne small clinical study in patients with esophageal cancer receiving chemo-radiotherapy shows that taking glutamine 30 grams daily for 28 days seems to prevent a reduction in lymphocytes when compared with placebo (2705). However, another small clinical trial in patients with leukemia or lymphoma receiving intensive chemotherapy shows that adding glutamine 26 grams to total parenteral nutrition (TPN), in place of other amino acids, does not affect duration of neutropenia when compared with receiving an isonitrogenous standard TPN (7295).\nless\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral glutamine is beneficial in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia.\nA very small, nonblinded, non-randomized evaluation of otherwise healthy patients over 50 years of age who were hospitalized with mild COVID-19 pneumonia shows that taking glutamine 10 grams three times daily orally with meals is associated with a 1-day decrease in hospital stay (from 10 days to 9) when compared with patients not taking glutamine. In the latter group, 4 patients required transfer to the ICU, compared with no patients in the glutamine group (103839). A similar, non-randomized evaluation of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia shows that adding the same dose of glutamine to other therapies for 5 days is associated with a 3-day decrease in hospital stay (from 14 days to 11) when compared with patients not taking glutamine. At the end of treatment, 0% of patients in the glutamine group required ICU services, compared with 54% of patients who did not receive glutamine. This study also shows that taking glutamine may increase appetite (108035). The validity of these findings is limited by short duration of treatment and use of non-standardized treatments.\nless\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral glutamine improves growth and development in children with cystic fibrosis.\nA small clinical study in undernourished or stunted children with cystic fibrosis shows that taking glutamine 0.7 grams/kg daily orally for 4 weeks with or without recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) does not promote protein gain when compared with rhGH alone (52321).\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Oral glutamine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific nutritional supplement drink containing glutamine 7 grams, arginine 7 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate 1.5 grams (Abound, Abbott) twice daily for 16 weeks does not improve total wound closure or reduce the time to complete healing when compared with a control drink in patients with diabetic foot ulcers (96637). It is unclear if this effect is due to glutamine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiarrhea. It is unclear if oral glutamine improves diarrhea in children and infants.\nOne preliminary clinical study in 6-24 month-old otherwise healthy children with acute diarrhea shows that taking capsules prepared with a specific glutamine powder (Power Glutamine, Champion Nutrition) 0.3 grams/kg daily for 7 days reduces the duration of diarrhea by about one day when compared with placebo (52323). However, other clinical research in male infants 1-12 months old with acute diarrhea and dehydration shows that adding glutamine 90 mmol/L along with the standard World Health Organization oral rehydration salts (ORS) does not decrease the duration of diarrhea, stool output, or the volume of oral rehydration solution required to achieve and maintain hydration when compared with standard ORS alone (7298).\nless\nExercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral glutamine is beneficial for exercise-induced muscle damage.\nA very small clinical crossover trial in professional athletes undergoing rigorous training shows that taking oral glutamine 6 grams daily for 20 days reduces serum levels of creatine kinase and myoglobin when compared with placebo (108031). The validity of these findings is limited due to the small size and short duration of treatment.\nless\nHematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). It is unclear whether oral glutamine or glutamine added to parenteral nutrition improves morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing HSCT. Some research has suggested that intravenous glutamine may actually worsen outcomes.\nSome research suggests that patients receiving glutamine-supplemented parenteral nutrition (PN) after HSCT primarily to treat hematologic malignancies have a diminished incidence of clinical infections, lower rates of microbial colonization, and decreased length of hospital stay when compared to control (2366, 52381). However, not all patients seem to benefit. Some research shows that oral glutamine or PN with glutamine does not reduce the risk of mortality or infections in patients with hematologic malignancies and/or solid tumors (5451, 52385). Also, a small clinical study in patients undergoing HSCT shows that PN with glutamine dipeptide may increase the duration of hospital stay (52292). Furthermore, one small study has found that receiving PN with glutamine was associated with lower disease-free survival and event-free survival over 3 years when compared with standard PN in patients receiving HSCT for hematologic malignancies (52355).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). There is limited evidence on the oral use of glutamine in patients with IBS.\nA clinical trial in adults with IBS (diarrhea-predominant, constipation-predominant, mixed, or alternating bowel habits) shows that following a low FODMAP diet supplemented with oral glutamine 15 grams three times daily for 6 weeks improves IBS-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) scores, with 88% of patients in the glutamine group reporting a 45% improvement in severity scores, compared with 60% of patients following the low FODMAP diet alone (108037). The validity of this finding is limited by short duration of treatment and lack of follow-up.\n\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with postinfectious, diarrhea-predominant IBS shows that taking glutamine 5 grams three times daily for 8 weeks leads to a nearly 14-fold greater likelihood of symptom improvement, defined as a reduction of 50 points or more on the IBS-SSS, and decreases stool frequency by 2.45 stools daily when compared with placebo. Taking glutamine also seems to reduce abdominal pain ratings by 55% and improve quality of life scores by 53% when compared to baseline in these patients (100944). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if oral glutamine improves survival in patients with advanced lung cancer.\nOne small clinical study in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer shows that taking glutamine 10 grams three times daily for 12 months along with palliative chemoradiotherapy prevents weight loss, which is an important predictor of survival, but does not increase the likelihood of progression-free survival when compared with palliative chemoradiotherapy alone (100942). It is unclear if this study was adequately powered to detect a difference in survival between groups.\nless\nMalnutrition. It is unclear if oral alanyl-glutamine improves height and weight in children at risk for malnutrition.\nPreliminary clinical research in children aged 2 months to 5 years from a low-income area of Brazil and at risk for malnutrition, shows that taking 3-12 grams of alanyl-glutamine orally daily for 10 days improves gut integrity and is associated with a modest, short-term increase in weight when compared with a glycine placebo (103838).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral glutamine is beneficial for weight loss.\nA preliminary clinical study in 36 overweight or obese adults shows that taking glutamine 30 grams daily for 2 weeks reduces waist circumference by 1.8 cm, but does not improve body weight, body mass index, or glycemic indices, when compared to baseline. None of these outcomes were improved over baseline in an alanine control group (100941). Given the small study size and short duration of therapy, the long-term effects of glutamine on anthropometric measures is unclear.\nless\nOpioid withdrawal. Oral glutamine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in Chinese patients undergoing detoxification from heroin shows that taking a combination of tyrosine, lecithin, 5-HTP, and glutamine 50 mg/kg orally daily for 6 days might reduce mood-related withdrawal symptoms when compared with placebo (88178). It is unclear if this effect is due to glutamine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nOral mucositis. There is contradictory evidence about the effects of glutamine in patients with, or at risk of developing, oral mucositis from chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nSmall clinical studies suggest that taking glutamine orally or swishing and swallowing a glutamine solution can decrease the incidence, severity, and duration of oral mucositis in some patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for cancer or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (2336, 2368, 2704, 5029). Additionally, three meta-analyses of highly heterogeneous clinical trials in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy suggests that glutamine reduces the incidence of grade 3-4 oral mucositis when compared with control (105014, 108028, 108036). Similarly, a small retrospective cohort study of adults with nasopharyngeal cancer suggests that parenteral administration of glutamine during 7 weeks of chemoradiation therapy is associated with a lower incidence of grade 3-4 oral mucositis when compared with control (113692). The validity of the findings from these studies and meta-analyses is limited for several reasons, including reporting bias, lack of sensitivity analysis, and population heterogeneity. Additionally, not all research has been positive. A meta-analysis of 5 clinical trials in adults with head or neck cancers shows that oral glutamine does not reduce the overall incidence of oral mucositis, or the incidence of moderate to severe oral mucositis, when compared with control (103836).\n\nGlutamine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small open-label study in adults undergoing chemoradiation for head and neck cancer shows that taking a specific combination product (Abound, Abbot) containing glutamine, L-arginine, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 24 grams twice daily throughout treatment reduces the incidence of grade 3 oral mucositis and attenuates weight loss when compared with no intervention (113726). It is unclear if this effect is due to glutamine, the other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of the study is limited by the lack of blinding.\n\nThe Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society for Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) cautiously recommends the use of oral glutamine to prevent oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy. However, due to some evidence suggesting that intravenous glutamine may actually worsen outcomes in HSCT patients, the MASCC/ISOO recommends against its use for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy, with or without total body irradiation, for HSCT (105004). Despite some concerns regarding the potential for glutamine to interfere with the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy treatment, small clinical and observational studies suggest that it does not reduce overall survival or increase disease progression in adults with head and neck cancer or nasopharyngeal cancer (113692, 113725).\nless\nPaclitaxel-induced myalgia and arthralgia. It is unclear if oral glutamine reduces the risk for myalgias and arthralgias due to paclitaxel.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking glutamine 10 grams three times daily for 5 days, starting on the day of chemotherapy and repeated over 2 cycles of chemotherapy, does not reduce the rate or severity of paclitaxel-induced myalgias or arthralgias when compared with placebo (52331).\nless\nPeptic ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral glutamine for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of glutamine for this condition.\nPostoperative adhesions. It is unclear if intraperitoneal glutamine is beneficial for preventing postoperative adhesions.\nA small clinical study in patients undergoing uterine fibroid removal shows that a single intraperitoneal instillation of alanyl glutamine 1 gram/kg in 170 mL immediately before suture closure is associated with severe or extensive postoperative adhesion formation in only 6% of patients, compared with 59% of patients receiving saline instillation (113688).\nless\nPostoperative fistula. Oral glutamine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in adults with enterocutaneous fistula shows that taking oral glutamine 10 grams, in combination with arginine 4.5 grams, daily for 7 days prior to surgery reduces recurrence of fistulas by 35% when compared with standard care (103837). It is unclear if this effect is due to glutamine, arginine, or the combination.\nless\nPostoperative infection. It is unclear if oral or intravenous glutamine is beneficial for the prevention of postoperative infection in patients who are recovering from surgery.\nMeta-analyses of mostly nonblinded clinical studies in adults with colorectal cancer who recently underwent radical surgery shows that daily supplementation with glutamine 0.3-1 grams/kg, administered either orally or intravenously (IV), decreases the risk of infectious complications by 69% and decreases the rate of anastomotic leakage when compared with control (108033, 113701). Similarly, observational research in this population also suggests that postoperative IV glutamine daily for at least five days is associated with fewer wound infections and a 64% lower risk of postoperative infectious complications (113695). Additionally, a meta-analysis of up to 7 clinical studies, primarily in critically ill adults post-abdominal surgery, shows that IV glutamine-containing dipeptides, providing 0.34-0.5 g/kg daily of glutamine, for up to one month reduces risk of infection by about 40%, but does not reduce mortality rates, when compared with control (103834). These findings are limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and unclear reporting.\n\nOther meta-analyses of clinical research show that glutamine supplementation, as free glutamine or glutamine-containing dipeptides, reduces the risk of hospital-acquired infections by 30% for patients in the surgical intensive care unit and by 41% for those who underwent elective surgery (91355, 91358).\n\nGlutamine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical study in patients undergoing surgery for enterocutaneous fistulas shows that taking oral glutamine 10 grams and L-arginine 4.5 grams daily for 7 days prior to surgery reduces the rate of postoperative infections when compared with standard care (103837). It is unclear if this effect is due to glutamine, arginine, or the combination.\nless\nPrediabetes. Glutamine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small, open-label sub-study in adults with prediabetes shows that taking a specific combination product (SAMANA FORCE, Evonik Operations) containing glutamine-alanine dipeptide 290 mg daily, Bacillus subtilis, turmeric, green tea extract, zinc, vitamin D, and B vitamins for 4 weeks modestly reduces fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and glycemic response to a standardized glucose test meal when compared to baseline (113698). It is unclear if this effect is due to glutamine, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of the study is limited by the lack of a comparator group, the small sample size, the retrospective design, and short duration of the study, which was not adequate to identify a related change in HbA1c.\nless\nPressure ulcers. Oral glutamine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in adults with stages II-IV pressure ulcers shows that taking a specific nutritional supplement drink (Abound, Abbott Nutrition) containing glutamine 7.4 grams, L-arginine 7.4 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.5 grams twice daily for 2 weeks does not improve wound area or healing scores on the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) measurement when compared with standard nutritional care (96506). However, the study duration may have been inadequate. Another very small retrospective study in sedentary older adults living in care facilities found that taking this same product regularly until complete healing of the pressure ulcer reduces the time to complete healing to 170 days on average, compared with 218 days on average in the control group (110396). It is unclear if this effect is related to glutamine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if oral glutamine reduces the risk of developing dermatitis from radiation therapy.\nA meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies in adults with either breast cancer or head and neck cancer shows that taking oral glutamine 15-30 grams daily 1 week prior to, during, and 1-2 weeks after radiation or chemoradiation treatment reduces the relative risk of moderate to severe radiation dermatitis by 51% when compared with control (113724). However, one of these trials, which utilized a combination product containing glutamine, L-arginine, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB), found no impact on the incidence of severe radiation-induced dermatitis (96639, 113724).\nless\nRadiation-induced esophagitis. It is unclear if oral glutamine reduces the risk of developing esophagitis from radiation therapy.\nA small clinical study in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer shows that taking glutamine 10 grams three times daily for 12 months along with a palliative dose of chemoradiotherapy (total 30 Gy) results in a 7% incidence of symptomatic (grade 2 or higher) radiation-induced esophagitis, compared with a 53% incidence with palliative chemoradiotherapy alone. The glutamine group also had a 5.8-day delay in the onset of esophagitis (100942). However, a lower dose of glutamine in patients receiving higher doses of radiotherapy might not be beneficial. A small clinical study in patients with advanced thoracic malignancies shows that taking glutamine 4 grams mixed in water twice daily for 4 weeks along with radiotherapy (total dose of at least 45 Gy) to the esophagus, with or without chemotherapy, does not slow the onset of radiation-induced esophagitis or reduce its severity when compared with a glycine placebo (105011).\nless\nShort bowel syndrome. It is unclear if oral glutamine improves symptoms of short bowel syndrome.\nAlthough small clinical studies suggest that glutamine plus growth hormone can decrease dependence on parenteral nutrition in some patients (2334, 2361, 2362, 2703), it has not shown benefit for improving intestinal absorption of energy in all studies (8185). Additionally, glutamine alone doesn't appear to be beneficial (7730).\nless\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear if intravenous glutamine is beneficial in patients hospitalized with severe TBI.\nA clinical trial in patients hospitalized for a severe TBI shows that adherence to a hypocaloric, low-protein diet supplemented with daily intravenous glutamine 0.3 g/kg for 7 days does not improve 28-day mortality when compared with standard nutritional support alone. However, it may reduce the length of ventilator use, hospitalization, and duration of intensive care unit stay (108034).\nless\nVincristine-induced neuropathy. It is unclear if oral glutamine reduces the risk of developing neuropathy from treatment with vincristine in children.\nPreliminary clinical research in children ages 1-21 years receiving vincristine for various cancer types shows that taking glutamine 6 grams/m2 twice daily orally for 21 days reduces sensory neuropathy when compared with placebo. There was a significant improvement in self-reported, but not parent-reported, quality of life scores as measured by the PedsQL scale. However, there was no effect on motor neuropathy with the use of glutamine (96517).\nless\nWound healing. It is unclear if oral glutamine improves wound healing.\nPreliminary clinical research in trauma patients with wound healing disorders shows that taking glutamine 20 grams orally daily in combination with ascorbic acid 500 mg, vitamin E 166 mg, beta-carotene 3.2 mg, selenium 100 mcg, and zinc 6.6 mg (Glutamine Plus, Fresenius Kabi) for 14 days reduces the time to wound closure by 29 days when compared with placebo. However, there is no difference in length of stay (97364).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate glutamine for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGlutamine has most often been used in divided or single doses of 15-30 grams daily for up to 12 months (52313, 91356, 96520, 100941, 100942, 100944, 103839). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nOral:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nIn most cases, glutamine is administered as a powder that is dissolved in 8 ounces of liquid. Endari (Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription-only product containing 5 grams of glutamine per packet. Capsules have also been prepared from glutamine powder (52323). Glutamine for commercial use is produced by a fermentation process with glutamine-producing bacteria (7736).\n\nGlutamine has low solubility and limited stability in parenteral amino acid solutions. Synthetic glutamine dipeptides, such as l-alanyl-l-glutamine, are sometimes used to overcome these problems. The glutamine dipeptide is cleaved in vivo (7732, 7737). Specific brands of glutamine dipeptide (alanyl-glutamine) used in clinical research include Dipeptiven (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) and Abound (Abbott Laboratories) (52275, 52284, 52316, 52341, 110396, 113692, 113694, 113726).",
            "Interactions with Drugs": "ANTICONVULSANTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, glutamine might antagonize the effects of anticonvulsant medications.\nGlutamine is metabolized to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate might have antagonistic effects with anticonvulsant drugs (7292, 7293, 7294). However, this interaction has not yet been reported in humans.\nless",

            "Interactions with Conditions": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIVER DISEASE\nTheoretically, glutamine intake might increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver disease. Glutamine is metabolized to ammonia. Increases in blood ammonia levels and worsened cognitive function has been reported in patients with liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis) after ingestion of glutamine 20 grams (7293, 10655). Monitor ammonia levels in patients with liver disease or impaired liver function who are taking glutamine. Advise patients with severe liver disease to avoid glutamine supplements.\nless\nBIPOLAR DISORDER\nTheoretically, glutamine might increase the risk of mania or hypomania. Taking glutamine 4 grams orally has been associated with one case of mania and one case of hypomania in adults with bipolar disorder(7291). Glutamine is a precursor to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (7292).\nless\nMONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE (MSG) HYPERSENSITIVITY\nTheoretically, people who are sensitive to MSG might be sensitive to glutamine. Glutamine is metabolized to glutamate in the body (5469, 7291).\nless\nSEIZURE DISORDERS\nTheoretically excess amounts of glutamine and its metabolite, glutamate, might increase the risk of seizures. Glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and an excess amount of both might lower the seizure threshold (7292, 7293). However, this effect has not been reported in humans. Until more is known, advise people with seizure disorders to use glutamine with caution.\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with glutamine.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nGlutamine is absorbed in the jejunum. In healthy subjects, oral glutamine 0.1 gram/kg resulted in a peak concentration of about 150 mcg/mL about 30 minutes after ingestion (52369, 96520). In an exploratory study in 5 patients with sickle cell disease, a 10-gram dose of oral glutamine resulted in peak concentrations about 30 minutes after ingestion, with a subsequent decrease and plateau occurring by 2 hours. Plasma levels remained elevated at 8 hours post-ingestion. Arginine levels in plasma and red blood cells also increased about 4 hours after glutamine ingestion (108032).\n\nOral glutamine supplementation may increase plasma concentrations to a greater extent than dietary glutamine consumed in a meal (108032).\nDistribution\nGlutamine is produced primarily in skeletal muscle and then released into the circulation. It is also synthesized in the intestine (94500). Tissues that require glutamine such as the immune system, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and liver obtain glutamine as needed from the blood (7729). After an intravenous bolus of glutamine, the volume of distribution was about 200 mL/kg (96520).\nMetabolism\nIn humans, glutamine is primarily oxidized. A small portion (7% to 10%) is used for gluconeogenesis. Glutamine is metabolized to glutamate, citrulline, arginine, proline, and ammonia in the body (7293, 52262, 52375, 94500).\nExcretion\nFollowing infusion of alanyl-glutamine dipeptide, this dipeptide is not found in urine (52373). The dipeptide is rapidly hydrolyzed, resulting in an elimination half-life of less than four minutes in humans (52374). The terminal half-life of glutamine is 1 hour. Glutamine is eliminated in the urine but is almost fully reabsorbed by the renal tubules (96520).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGlutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in the body (7739). It is produced primarily in skeletal muscle and then released into the circulation. Tissues that require glutamine, such as the immune system, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and liver, obtain glutamine as needed from the blood (7729). Glutamine acts as an inter-organ nitrogen and carbon transporter (5467).\n\nThe intestinal mucosa can synthesize glutamine; however, this endogenous synthesis may be insufficient to meet physiological and metabolic needs during periods of severe catabolic stress or in cases of intestinal dysfunction (7733). As a result, glutamine is a classified as a conditionally essential amino acid, meaning that humans may require an exogenous source when endogenous synthesis is insufficient. Unlike essential amino acids, which the human body cannot synthesize, there is no established recommended daily allowance (RDA) or adequate intake (AI) for glutamine (94500).\nAdrenal affects\nA very small clinical crossover trial in professional athletes undergoing highly strenuous training shows that taking oral glutamine 6 grams daily for 20 days reduces levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone when compared with placebo (108031).\nAnti-inflammatory\nIn patients with inflammation, glutamine appears to reduce levels of inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin (52254, 52279, 52345, 52353, 52412) and possibly improve cellular immune function (52268, 52287, 52365), although it does not seem to improve neutrophil function (52261, 52291). Glutamine may also increase levels of heat shock protein-70 (hsp70) (52343).\n\nHuman research in various patient populations suggests that taking glutamine reduces levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (96513, 103833, 103835, 108030, 108035, 113686). Some subgroup analyses suggest that improvements in CRP may be greater when glutamine is delivered via the parenteral route (96513, 108030), although analyses of adults with severe pancreatitis or colorectal cancer found that both routes result in reduced levels of CRP (113686, 113701). These analyses also show that enteral and parenteral glutamine can reduce levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (113686, 113701). A clinical study in adults with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia shows that taking oral glutamine 10 grams three times daily for 5 days decreases levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta when compared with control (108035).\nAntioxidant Effects\nOxidative stress contributes to the effects of sickle cell disease. Glutamine has an antioxidant effect by increasing the proportion of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides in sickle cell erythrocytes (99414). Clinical research in adults with a confirmed COVID-19 infection and lower respiratory tract involvement shows that taking oral glutamine 10 grams three times daily for 5 days decreases levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and improves total antioxidant capacity when compared with control (108035). Additionally, research in a rat model of diabetes shows that glutamine administration decreases levels of MDA and increases levels of reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase, restoring them to normal levels, when compared with control (112788).\nCardioprotective effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that glutamine might protect the heart from ischemia and EKG changes in patients with chronic stable angina (8183).\nEndocrine effects\nA meta-analysis of various patient populations suggests that enteral or parenteral glutamine improves fasting blood glucose levels when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses suggest that fasting blood glucose levels are reduced by a greater amount after enteral use, whereas improvements in insulin sensitivity may be greater with parenteral use (108030). Research in a rat model of diabetes also shows that glutamine administration reduces blood glucose levels and regenerates pancreatic islet cells when compared with control (112788).\nExercise performance effects\nThere is interest in the use of glutamine for enhancing exercise performance. This is partially due to its role as an amino acid in protein synthesis. In humans, glutamine may also increase the storage of muscle glycogen following exercise (5457). However, it does not appear to impact the resynthesis of muscle glycogen in recovery (52259).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is some evidence suggesting that glutamine, in addition to serving as a metabolic fuel for enterocytes, might play a regulatory role in the intestine, affecting cell proliferation and differentiation (7733). The gastrointestinal tract is one of the largest utilizers of glutamine in the body (5469). Depletion of glutamine can result in atrophy, ulceration, and necrosis of intestinal epithelium. A clinical study in adults with moderate to severe burns shows that administering enteral nutrition supplemented with alanyl glutamine 0.5 grams/kg daily for 14 days may reduce intestinal mucosal injury when compared with standard nutritional support (108027).\n\nSome cancer patients may have reduced levels of glutamine (2368). Since gastrointestinal cells are rapidly dividing, they are highly susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. Glutamine treatment is thought to help prevent chemotherapy and radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity by maintaining viability of gastrointestinal tissues (2368). Clinical research in adults receiving chemotherapy suggests that glutamine may modestly reduce the duration, but not the incidence, of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (7233, 7235, 7285, 7295, 96516, 113694).\n\nIn patients with diarrhea, glutamine appears to increase water and electrolyte absorption (52336), reduce loss of water and sodium from the gut (52395), and improve gut permeability (7299, 7300, 100944). However, research in adults with other health issues, including subclinical exertional heat stress, has found no effect of enteral glutamine on intestinal permeability or intestinal epithelial injury (113689, 116114).\nGrowth effects\nThe rapidly growing fetus and premature infant seem to require glutamine for growth and normal physiologic functions (7740).\nHepatic effects\nGlutamine-containing dipeptides appear to protect hepatic function in patients following bone marrow transplantation, based on preserved levels of protein C and albumin (5452). However, in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe burns, glutamine supplementation did not appear to improve levels of liver transaminases or bilirubin (108027).\n\nResearch in a rat model of diabetes shows that glutamine administration lowers liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels when compared with control (112788).\nHumoral effects\nA meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with colorectal cancer who have recently undergone radical surgery shows that oral or parenteral glutamine administration increases indicators of humoral immune function, such as IgG, IgM, and IgA, when compared with control (108033). Likewise, a meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with severe acute pancreatitis shows that the addition of glutamine to enteral or parenteral nutritional support increases IgG when compared with conventional nutritional support alone (113686). Clinical research in adults with polytrauma in the intensive care unit also shows that parenteral administration of glutamine 50 mg/kg daily for 7 days increases IgA and B-lymphocyte levels when compared with control (113702).\n\nThere is also interest in using glutamine to improve immune response to the influenza vaccine. A small clinical study in older adults receiving an intramuscular trivalent influenza vaccine shows that taking glutamine 0.3 g/kg daily for 30 days, with or without exercise, increases antibody titers against the H1N1 virus and increases IgM concentrations when compared with baseline (105012). The validity of this finding is limited because statistical comparisons between the treatment and control groups were not reported.\nImmune effects\nGlutamine is metabolized in the mitochondria and is important for providing metabolic fuel to lymphocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts (5468, 5469, 7739). Glutamine can enhance the function of stimulated immune cells. It seems to affect lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production, bacterial killing by neutrophils, and phagocytic and secretory activities of macrophages (7734). In patients with cancer, some research suggests it might restore natural killer cell function in healthy cells and improve protein metabolism (7739). Neutrophils and monocytes are dependent upon glutamine to maintain phagocytic action (10225). Decreased glutamine concentrations following surgery seems to impair the function of neutrophils and monocytes, which might increase the risk of infection (10225). Parenteral glutamine following surgery appears to improve lymphocyte count and function in some patients (5453, 52284).\n\nIn patients with HIV/AIDS and CD4+ T cell counts below 500, taking glutamine 12.4 grams daily for 30 days increased CD4+ T cell counts by 35%, although they remained below 500. Serum C-reactive protein and interferon gamma-inducible protein-10 also decreased (103833). A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with colorectal cancer who have recently undergone radical surgery shows that glutamine administration increases CD4+ T cell counts and decreases CD8+ T cell counts when compared with control (108033). Additionally, clinical research in adults with polytrauma in the intensive care unit also shows that parenteral administration of glutamine 50 mg/kg daily for 7 days increases CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ T cell counts when compared with control (113702).\nMuscle effects\nFollowing surgery or accidental injury, about one third of the nitrogen mobilized for wound repair and vital organ function is from glutamine (7735). During physical stress the body consumes more glutamine than the skeletal muscle can produce. Progressive muscle breakdown (wasting) can occur as the body tries to meet glutamine requirements (7729). Protein sparing occurs when enough protein and amino acids are provided to prevent muscle breakdown. Glutamine has been shown to have protein sparing effects in very low birth weight infants and healthy adults (52276, 52372, 52400); however, glutamine does not always spare muscle protein (52315, 52328). Following surgery, glutamine might promote a positive nitrogen balance (52371, 52377) and attenuate muscle atrophy (116103). It is possible that the age and condition of the patient play a role in the muscle-sparing effects of glutamine. In some patients with cachexia, glutamine, along with arginine and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate increased fat free mass, possibly by decreasing protein breakdown and improving protein synthesis (1909, 52280). Glutamine also functions as a precursor for other amino acids, glucose, purines and pyrimidines, glutathione, and glutamate (5468, 5469, 5470, 7292, 7740). Although glutamine is often used for muscle development, preliminary research suggests glutamine does not affect muscle precursor cells called satellite cells, which are thought to cause muscular hypertrophy (13773).\nRenal effects\nA clinical study in adults with moderate to severe burns shows that administering enteral nutrition supplemented with glutamine 0.5 grams/kg daily, beginning within 24 hours of hospitalization and continued for 14 days, reduces levels of beta2-microglobulin when compared with control (108027).\nWeight effects\nWhile clinical research on the effectiveness of glutamine for reducing body weight in overweight and obese patients is conflicting (91356, 100941), some research suggests that the effect of glutamine on body weight is related to increased postprandial energy expenditure and fat oxidation (52361). Also, some animal research suggests that the effects of glutamine on body weight are related to its ability to induce insulin resistance in adipose tissue through enhancement of hexosamine pathway activity. By reducing the activity of insulin and uptake of glucose in body fat, glutamine is thought to decrease lipogenesis and reduce body fat (100941).\nWound-healing effects\nFollowing surgery or accidental injury, about one third of the nitrogen mobilized for wound repair and vital organ function is from glutamine (7735). In human research, a combination of glutamine, arginine, and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate increased collagen synthesis (52286, 99413)."

Intravenous glutathione seems to reduce neurotoxicity from cisplatin.\nClinical studies in cancer patients receiving cisplatin shows that administering glutathione 1.5 grams/m2 by intravenous injection over 15 minutes seems to help prevent neurotoxicity and other toxicities from cisplatin when compared with control. Glutathione may also increase the highest dose of cisplatin that patients are able to tolerate (5373, 5374, 5377, 5378, 5380). In one study, this same dose of intravenous glutathione was administered, along with intramuscular glutathione 600 mg on days 2-5 (5374).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging.

Although there is interest in using oral glutathione for Alzheimer disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of glutathione for this condition.\nAngioplasty. It is unclear if intravenous glutathione is beneficial in patients recovering from angioplasty following myocardial infarction.\nA small clinical trial in Italian adults undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) shows that intravenous infusion of glutathione sodium salt 2500 mg/25 mL over 10 minutes before angioplasty and at 24, 48 and 72 hours after angioplasty reduces length of hospital stay by around 2 days; reduces markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte damage; and improves measures of left ventricular function at 6-month's follow-up when compared with placebo (111417, 111418).\nless\nAthletic performance. Oral glutathione has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical trial in young, resistance-trained males shows that taking glutathione (Setria, Kyowa Hakko Bio) 200 mg in combination with L-citrulline 2 grams daily for 8 weeks in conjunction with resistance training has no effect on muscle strength, as measured by leg and bench presses, when compared with L-citrulline alone or with placebo (97394). The trial shows the increase in lean body mass with training to be significantly higher with glutathione and L-citrulline compared with placebo at 4 weeks. However, by 8 weeks of training lean body mass is not different between supplementation and placebo.\n\nAn additional small, cross-over trial in young, endurance-trained males shows that taking glutathione 200 mg in combination with L-citrulline 2 grams (Setria Performance Blend, Kyowa Hakko Bio) daily for 8 days does not improve high speed running performance, as measured by time to exhaustion, when compared with placebo (112285).\nless\nCardiovascular disease (CVD).

Although there is interest in using oral glutathione for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of glutathione for this condition.\nCirrhosis. It is unclear if oral glutathione is beneficial for improving cirrhosis severity.\nA small clinical study in patients with cirrhosis shows that taking glutathione 500 mg daily with or without vitamin B6 50 mg daily for 12 weeks does not affect disease severity or reduce oxidative stress when compared with placebo (104392). These findings are limited because the study might not have been powered to detect a difference between groups, as 21 of the 61 participants were lost to follow-up.\nless\nCognitive function. Oral glutathione has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small cross-over trial in healthy adults shows that taking a product providing 20 mg/day of glutathione as part of a combination product containing probiotics (L. helveticus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium longum), inulin, zinc, potassium, magnesium and lactoferrin (Puraflor, GSK Consumer Healthcare) for 4 weeks does not affect cognitive performance during acute stress when compared with placebo (110923).\nless\nContrast induced nephropathy. It is unclear if intravenous glutathione is beneficial for preventing contrast induced nephropathy.\nA small, non-blinded clinical study in patients aged 65 or older with diabetes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) shows that intravenous reduced glutathione 180 mg daily for 4 days, starting 6 hours prior to PCI, in conjunction with saline hydration, does not reduce the rate of contrast induced nephropathy when compared with saline hydration alone. Saline hydration was administered at a rate of 1 mL/kg/hr, starting 6 hours prior to PCI and continuing for 12 hours after PCI (107477). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nCystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral glutathione is beneficial in children with this condition.\nA small clinical study in children ages 2-10 years old with cystic fibrosis shows that taking glutathione powder 65 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses for 6 months does not impact weight or inflammatory biomarkers when compared with placebo (104391).\nless\nGlaucoma.

It is unclear if oral glutathione is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking glutathione 300 mg daily for 4 months reduces alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels by around 13% and triglyceride levels by around 16%, but has no impact on aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels or liver stiffness, when compared with baseline in patients with NAFLD (97397).

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with glutathione.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAlthough glutathione is present in fruits, vegetables, and meats, the levels in the body do not seem to correlate to dietary intake. This suggests that oral glutathione might be inactivated by peptidases in the gut (5344). Despite evidence suggesting that glutathione is bioavailable in rodents (5363, 5364), oral doses of 1-3 grams cause negligible increases in human plasma levels in adults (5362, 90621, 97399). However, some clinical evidence suggests that oral glutathione can increase plasma levels of reduced glutathione in children. Other research shows that sublingual glutathione has improved bioavailability over oral glutathione (97399) while topical administration does not (90637). Currently, researchers are investigating whether administering glutathione precursors, such as glutamine and n-acetylcysteine, might increase glutathione levels (5344, 5389, 5392). In human research, intravenous glutathione increased levels of reduced glutathione after ten minutes; however, they returned to normal after 20 minutes. Oxidized levels of glutathione also increased and the increased levels were maintained for an additional 10 minutes (90636).\nMetabolism\nFollowing intravenous glutathione in human research, the amino acids, glutamic acid, cysteine, and methionine all increased, peaking at 10 minutes for glutamate and cysteine and at 20 minutes for methionine. Cysteine peaked at 30 minutes followed by a slow decrease (90636). In children, following oral and topical glutathione, plasma levels of cysteine, taurine, and total sulfate increased (90637).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGlutathione is primarily synthesized in the liver (5387, 5388). It is involved in DNA synthesis and repair, protein and prostaglandin synthesis, amino acid transport, metabolism of toxins and carcinogens, immune system function, prevention of oxidative cell damage, and enzyme activation (5344, 5386, 90636). Cellular glutathione levels increase during exercise (5386, 5398). Glutathione deficiency is associated with aging, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetes, lung and gastrointestinal disease, pre-eclampsia, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, and poor prognosis in AIDS (5344, 5346, 5347, 5348, 5349, 5350, 5351, 5352, 5353, 5354)(5393, 5394, 5395, 5396, 5397, 90638).\nAnti-cancer effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that glutathione intake from fruits and vegetables might be associated with a reduced risk of pharyngeal cancer (5345).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nClinical research shows that intravenous infusion of glutathione reduces various markers of inflammation, including neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (111417).\nAnti-viral effects\nGlutathione may inhibit the activity of enzymes that help the flu virus colonize cells lining the mouth and throat. Flu-infected mice fed glutathione-enriched drinking water have lower tissue virus levels than untreated mice. Human studies are needed to determine the effects of glutathione on flu infection (5061).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe clinical effects of glutathione are thought to be related to its antioxidant effects. In laboratory research, reduced glutathione has been shown to reduce the production of reactive oxygen species (90636). In other laboratory research, reduced glutathione has been shown to protect cells against reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species (90638). Reactions with reduced glutathione (GSH) result in the generation of oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG). GSSG may be reduced back to GSH by the enzyme glutathione reductase.\n\nIn some human research, oral glutathione does not appear to reduce biomarkers of oxidative stress, such as urinary F2-isoprostanes or 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (90621). However, a clinical study of intravenous glutathione shows improvements in certain markers of oxidative stress, including decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase derived peptide (NOX-2) activity and increased nitric oxide levels (111417).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using glutathione to lighten the skin. A small clinical study in Filipino females with brown or dark brown skin shows that taking a lozenge containing glutathione 500 mg and unknown amounts of selenium, vitamin C, vitamin D3, vitamin E, and grape seed extract daily for 8 weeks lightens the skin when compared with baseline (97396). Also, a small clinical study in Indonesian females shows that taking oral glutathione 600 mg, alpha-lipoic acid 50 mg, and zinc picolinate 4 mg twice daily in conjunction with twice daily topical application of glutathione 2% plus vitamin C to facial skin for 8 weeks lightens skin and reduces melanin index to a greater extent than topical and oral glutathione monotherapy. These outcomes were measured by chromameter and mexameter, respectively (107476).\nNeuroprotective effects\nGlutathione is synthesized by neurons and glial cells. In laboratory research, it has been suggested that glutathione protects against toxins by acting as an antioxidant. Glutathione is also known to modify protein sulfhydryl groups associated with toxins, perhaps increasing the excretion of these compounds from the cell (90638).\n\nThere is evidence that reduced levels of glutathione are associated with Parkinson's disease. However, there is debate as to whether reduced glutathione levels result from increased oxidative stress, which is associated with Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, or whether glutathione depletion itself actually contributes to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. There is some preliminary evidence that glutathione depletion may potentiate inflammation associated with Parkinson's disease by increasing inflammatory cytokine production and activity (90638). Theoretically, glutathione supplementation may attenuate the inflammation associated with Parkinson's disease. However, research in animal models suggests that glutathione supplementation is unlikely to be effective, as glutathione cannot penetrate neurons. Glutathione precursors such as gamma-glutamylcysteine or cysteinylglycine may be more effective (90638)."

Oral glycerol may improve hydration during exercise, but clinical studies evaluating glycerol for improving measures of athletic performance are limited and conflicting.\nSeveral clinical studies show that glycerol increases serum osmolality and improves hydration status during exercise (2475, 2476, 93757, 93760, 93761, 93765). One meta-analysis, including 14 studies and 99 patients, shows that glycerol-induced hyperhydration increases body water by approximately 2.5-fold when compared with water-induced hyperhydration (93757). Also, taking glycerol along with table salt 7.5 grams per liter fluid seems to improve hydration status when compared withg glycerol alone (99162). Research regarding the effects of glycerol on thirst, comfort, temperature regulation, sweating, and heart rate is conflicting (2475, 2476, 93760, 99162).\n\nWhile glycerol may improve hydration status during exercise, it is unclear whether it can improve measures of athletic performance. An early meta-analysis including a total of 36 athletes shows that taking glycerol increases endurance performance by 2.6%. Although this is a small difference, it might be considered meaningful to athletes (93757). Some small clinical studies in athletes suggest that glycerol increases endurance and time to exhaustion, with no effect on heat regulation (2475, 2479, 93764). However, other small studies suggest that glycerol does not reduce perceived exhaustion or improve exercise performance (2476, 93760). Also, glycerol has not been shown to increase time to exhaustion in triathletes (2492).\n\nWhen used to improve athletic performance, glycerol is most often taken at doses of 1-1.5 gram/kg in conjunction with approximately 1.5 L of fluid, 60-120 minutes before competition, and in some cases continued during the competition (2475, 93757, 93760, 93764).\nless\nIchthyosis. Topical application of a specific product containing glycerol and paraffin may improve symptoms of ichthyosis in children. The benefits of topical glycerol alone in these patients is unknown.\nA large clinical trial in children aged 1 month to 18 years shows that applying a specific product (Dexeryl, Pierre Fabre Laboratoires) containing glycerol 15% and paraffin 10% for 4 weeks reduces symptoms of non-bullous ichthyosis by at least 50% in an additional 17% of children when compared with a placebo cream. Applying this specific product also improves pruritus by an additional 45% when compared with placebo (93756). It is unclear if these findings are due to glycerol, paraffin, or the combination.\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nMeningitis. Some clinical research suggests that oral glycerol does not reduce the risk of mortality or seizures in adults and children with bacterial meningitis, although it may reduce certain sequelae.\nA meta-analysis of five low-quality clinical trials including 1,270 patients shows that adjunctive treatment with glycerol as an oral osmotic agent does not reduce the risk of mortality, seizures, or gastrointestinal symptoms in adults and children with acute bacterial meningitis, although it may modestly reduce the risk of deafness and residual neurological deficit in surviving children (99160). Clinical research included in the meta-analysis has used glycerol 1.5 grams/kg every 6 hours in children aged 2 months to 16 years (93762, 93763).\nless\nPrematurity. Rectal glycerol does not appear to reduce the time to enteral feeding in premature infants.\nGlycerol is used as an enema or given by suppository to facilitate the evacuation of meconium in premature infants in order to reduce the time to enteral feeding. However, two meta-analyses of small studies in preterm infants, that include some of the same studies, show that administering glycerol suppositories does not reduce the number of days to full enteral feeds when compared with placebo or no treatment (99166, 112003). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of dosages used in the included studies.\nless\nLIKELY INEFFECTIVE\nStroke. Intravenous glycerol may not improve mortality or symptoms in patients with acute ischemic stroke.\nSeveral clinical studies show that intravenous administration of glycerol does not improve symptoms of acute stroke (2480, 2481, 2482, 2484, 2486). Additionally, one clinical study in elderly patients with acute ischemic stroke shows that while glycerol can improve initial survival, it does not reduce the risk of overall mortality when compared with placebo (2483).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDandruff. Topical glycerol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne clinical trial in adults with dandruff shows that applying a leave-in hair lotion containing glycerol 10%, stearic acid 2.5%, and sunflower seed oil 0.6%, 3 times weekly for 8 weeks, modestly reduces dandruff severity throughout use and for up to one week after the last application when compared with a placebo lotion. The glycerol lotion also reduced total water loss from the scalp by 8% and increased moisturization by 23% (93758). It is unclear if these findings are due to glycerol, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDry skin. Topical glycerol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the management of dry skin associated with kidney failure; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne small, open-label clinical study in adults with kidney failure and moderate to severe uremic xerosis shows that applying an emulsion containing glycerol 15% and paraffin 10% twice daily for 7 days reduces the severity of xerosis when compared with a placebo emulsion. The glycerol-containing emulsion produces a treatment response in an additional 29% of patients, improves quality of life, and reduces scale density and thickness when compared with placebo (93754). It is unclear if these findings are due to glycerol, paraffin, or the combination.\nless\nGlaucoma.

It is unclear if intravenous glycerol is beneficial in patients with Meniere disease.\nA small, uncontrolled clinical study in adults with unilateral, intractable Meniere disease shows that intravenous administration of glycerol 10% at a dose of 0.5 grams/kg once daily for 2 consecutive days, twice monthly for 6 months, reduces the frequency of vertigo attacks and improves quality of life when compared to baseline. Patients reported an average of 3.2 vertigo attacks per month at baseline and 1.2 vertigo attacks per month after 6 months of treatment (106649). The lack of a control group limits the validity of these findings.\nless\nNeonatal jaundice. It is unclear if rectal glycerol improves jaundice-related outcomes in premature infants.\nA small clinical study in neonates receiving phototherapy for jaundice shows that administering glycerol suppositories has no effect on the duration of phototherapy needed for jaundice treatment, or on bilirubin levels or the rate of bilirubin decline when compared with no glycerol suppositories (99165).\nless\nObesity.

It is used by the body as a backbone for triglycerides (2477, 93762).\nAnti-meningitis effects\nGlycerol has been clinically studied in children with meningitis. The benefits of glycerol in patients with meningitis might be due to its effect on osmolality, which is thought to reduce loss of cerebrospinal fluid and enhance cerebral circulation. Furthermore, glycerol might reduce inflammation by scavenging free radicals (93762).\nDermatologic effects\nWhen applied to the skin, glycerol possibly has hydration effects by preventing water loss (99164). Glycerol is a humectant that is commonly included in moisturizers. Humectants work by drawing water from the dermis to the epidermis. When it is humid, humectants can also draw water from the air into the skin. There has been interest in using humectants to treat wrinkled skin. Although humectants can temporarily puff up the skin to diminish wrinkles, they do not eliminate wrinkled skin. In very dry climates, humectants can cause water loss and lead to dry, cracked skin. For this reason, humectants are often combined with an occlusive agent such as petrolatum to prevent epidermal water loss (17631).\nHydration effects\nOverall, glycerol has demonstrated hydration effects in clinical research (2475, 2476, 93757, 93760, 93761, 99162). Supplemental glycerol increases serum osmolality (2477, 99162). However, glycerol does not reduce water loss in underwater divers (2478).\nLaxative effects\nGlycerol has hyperosmotic laxative activity (15).\nOtic effects\nIn clinical research, glycerol has demonstrated dehydrating activity in the ear canal, possibly resulting in reduced edema (93759)."

However, when used with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine, glycine appears to have a negligible effect on or worsen symptoms of schizophrenia (10253, 11321).

Oral glycine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA very small clinical study in adults aged 61-80 years with overweight or obesity shows that taking a specific combination product (GlyNAC), providing glycine 100 mg/kg and N-acetyl cysteine 100 mg/kg, daily for 16 weeks reduces waist circumference but does not improve body weight or body mass index (BMI) when compared to baseline. None of these outcomes were improved in individuals taking placebo (110624). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of statistical comparison between groups. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to glycine, N-acetyl cysteine, or the combination.\nless\nOveractive bladder. It is unclear if oral glycine is beneficial in patients with overactive bladder.\nOne very small, non-randomized, crossover trial in patients with overactive bladder shows that taking glycine 3 grams twice daily for 4 weeks reduces urinary urgency, urinary incontinence, and nighttime urinary frequency and improves quality of life scores when compared with placebo (106497). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of randomization.\nless\nPhysical performance.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, glycine is absorbed rapidly in the blood with maximal levels occurring approximately 40 minutes after ingestion (92319).\nDistribution\nThe concentration of glycine in the brain is fairly stable due to the dietary consumption of glycine. However, addition of supplements can increase CNS concentrations of glycine. Glycine appears to passively diffuse across the blood-brain barrier (10252, 92315).\nExcretion\nGlycine is eliminated within hours after ingestion (92319).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGlycine is an amino acid. It is not considered an essential amino acid because the body makes glycine from serine. A typical diet contains about 2 grams of glycine daily. The primary sources are protein rich foods including meat, fish, dairy, and legumes (10252).\nAnti-cancer effects\nLaboratory research suggests that glycine may inhibit the growth of certain types of cancer. In animal research, glycine decreases the growth of melanoma cells by inhibiting vascularization (10261). A similar effect may inhibit the growth of liver tumors (10262).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn humans with metabolic syndrome, glycine appears to benefit measures of oxidative stress such as lipid peroxidation. It is possible that protection against oxidative stress may prevent some of the long term adverse effects associated with metabolic syndrome (92317).\nCardioprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that glycine protects against chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity (106495, 111246). Some researchers theorize that glycine's antioxidant effects, notably increases in superoxide dismutase, glutathione, catalase, and uric acid, protect the heart from reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that lead to cardiotoxicity (111246).\nCentral nervous system (CNS) effects\nIn the CNS, glycine acts as an agonist at the glutamate receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). NMDA receptors are associated with negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia (10257). NMDA receptors also seem to be associated with memory and learning processes (11322). The concentration of glycine in the brain is fairly stable due to the dietary consumption of glycine. However, addition of supplements can increase CNS concentrations of glycine (10252). Also, there is some preliminary evidence in animals to suggest that glycine might increase daytime expression of arginine vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (92316).\nCyclosporine-protective effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that glycine can protect the kidneys from damage induced by cyclosporine, possibly by reducing cyclosporine-induced hypoxia and free radicals (10258, 10259).\nHepatoprotective effects\nGlycine may help improve recovery of the liver after alcohol-induced damage. Laboratory research suggests that glycine might reduce the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by Kupffer cells. This effect leads to a reduction in inflammation, necrosis, and steatosis in alcohol-induced hepatitis (10260).\nMetabolic effects\nWhile there is some interest in using glycine for conditions associated with metabolic abnormalities, most evidence suggests that there is no benefit. One animal study shows that chronic glycine supplementation does not increase or decrease insulin, glucose, or triglyceride levels (106496). Another animal study shows that glycine supplementation positively impacts hepatic insulin response in vitro on primary rat hepatocytes but not in vivo in obese mice. Glycine appears to worsen metabolic syndrome by promoting hepatic gluconeogenesis and shows no effect on muscle insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. The contrasting in vivo and in vitro results may be due to differential expression of glycine N-methyltransferase (111245).\nRespiratory effects\nIn patients with cystic fibrosis, taking glycine modestly improved respiratory function. These improvements were associated with a decrease in sputum levels of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), but there were no changes in sputum or serum levels of any other inflammatory markers (98583).\nSleep effects\nAnimal research suggests the beneficial effect of glycine on sleep may be due to NMDA receptor binding resulting in vasodilation and a drop in core body temperature. Serotonin release is also increased (92315)."

Inappropriate use of high concentrations of alpha hydroxy acids, including glycolic acid, can cause skin burns. Concentrations greater than 10% should only be used under the supervision of a dermatologist (10101, 106612).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of glycolic acid when used orally.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: LIKELY SAFE when used topically in appropriate concentrations (952, 10101, 10102, 95601, 106612).

With the use of high concentrations, bleeding, blistering, burns, itching, redness, severe irritation, and skin discoloration with sloughing, stinging, and swelling.\nDermatologic\nTopically, glycolic acid is generally well tolerated when used in concentrations at or below 10% (952, 10101, 10102, 106612). In general, products should be tested on a small area of skin before applying it to a larger area.\n\nAlpha hydroxy acids like glycolic acid can increase sensitivity to the sun and ultraviolet (UV) light. This can increase damage to the skin, and after long-term use, might increase the risk of skin cancer. These effects can be mitigated by using sunscreen and/or protective clothing.\n\nAdverse reactions to alpha hydroxy acids like glycolic acid can range from mild irritation, a tingling sensation, and stinging, to severe redness, swelling, itching, blistering, bleeding, rash, burns, and skin discoloration (6080, 10101, 92209, 92214, 92219, 106612). Higher concentrations, like those used in facial peels, can cause severe skin irritation, burning, sloughing, and limited frosting and whitening to scar areas, which sometimes results in transient hyperpigmentation (10101, 10102, 92219, 101805, 101807, 108416, 110217, 110225). There is one report of a case of contact urticaria within one minute of application of a facial peel containing glycolic acid 35% in a patient with acne who was naïve to glycolic acid and had no history of atopy or allergies (108417).\n\nThere is some concern that use of alpha hydroxy acids, such as glycolic acid, in conjunction with retinoids may increase the risk for adverse effects. However, a retrospective study in patients with acne has shown that use of superficial facial peels with glycolic acid is not associated with more side effects (e.g., excessive dryness, burning, pigmentation changes) in patients receiving oral isotretinoin when compared with patients not receiving oral isotretinoin (108414).\nless\nImmunologic\nTopically, treatment with glycolic acid has rarely resulted in a secondary bacterial infection (110217).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nAcne. Topical glycolic acid seems to improve acne severity in patients aged 12 years or older with mild to moderate acne.\nClinical research in patients with mild acne shows that application of an oil-in-water emulsion containing glycolic acid 10% daily for 45 days modestly improves acne severity when compared with placebo after 45 days. However, improvement after 90 days was no longer significant (95601). Short-contact skin peels with glycolic acid have also been evaluated in adults with acne. A small clinical study in patients with darker skin tones and moderate acne shows that application of glycolic acid 40% in a short-contact skin peel every 2 weeks for 5 applications reduces the number of acne lesions, particularly noninflammatory lesions, by at least 50% in 88% of patients, compared with only 38% of patients using placebo (92214). Clinical research has also compared the once daily use of a peel providing glycolic acid 5% (Cosmocos, Korea) along with sodium hydroxide, allantoin, trehalose, and Portulaca oleracea extract daily with four biweekly sessions with glycolic acid 20% (NeoStrata, NJ, USA). Two weeks after treatment completion, both treatments were found to be effective for mild to moderate acne (110224).\n\nGlycolic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients in patients with acne in an open-label study. Topical application with a specific product (Blemish + Age Defense; SkinCeuticals) containing glycolic acid with citric acid, dioic acid, salicylic acid, lipohydroxy acid (LHA), and N-2 hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid reduces the grade and number of post-inflammatory hyperpigmented acne lesions from baseline (108413). However, it is unclear if any effects are due to the glycolic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. The validity of these findings is also limited by the lack of comparator group.\nless\nAging skin. Topical glycolic acid seems to reduce wrinkles and other signs of aging and photodamage.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that application of concentrated glycolic acid (20% to 70%), alone or in combination with lactic acid, in short-contact skin peels at 2- to 4-week intervals for 3-4 months, reduces fine wrinkles around the eyes when compared with baseline or controls not using a glycolic acid peel (953, 92217, 101807, 108415). However, application of concentrated glycolic acid in short-contact skin peels does not seem to be as effective as a retinaldehyde-based antiaging cream for improving skin texture (101807). Most of the available clinical trials are small and do not include blinded comparison groups. Some preliminary clinical research also shows that application of glycolic acid daily reduces wrinkles and other signs of aging or photodamage. Studies have used cream or lotion containing glycolic acid 8% or 25% applied once or twice daily for up to 6 months (952, 954).\nless\nAtrophic acne scars. Topical glycolic acid, alone or in combination with microneedling, seems to improve atrophic acne scars.\nA small clinical study in females with atrophic acne scars shows that application of glycolic acid as a facial peel or lotion seems to improve the appearance of scars. Serial applications of facial peels with glycolic acid increasing in strength from 20% up to 70% and increasing in contact time up to 4-5 minutes as tolerated every 2 weeks improves the appearance of atrophic acne scars when compared with once or twice daily usage of a lotion containing glycolic acid 15%. Repetitive use of glycolic acid 70% at least 6 times is usually needed before improvement is seen. Glycolic acid 15% lotion also seems to be moderately effective in persons who cannot tolerate facial peels (10101). Other clinical research shows that application of facial peels with glycolic acid 35% or 70% in combination with microneedling procedures for 3-5 treatments improves the appearance of acne scars by at least 34% when compared with microneedling procedures alone (92218, 98608, 101805). One small clinical trial shows that application of facial peels with glycolic acid 35% with microneedling procedures for 5 treatments each is as effective as a similar schedule of trichloroacetic acid 15% peels and microneedling procedures for improving the appearance of acne scars. Microneedling procedures were separated from facial peel treatment by 2 weeks for a total of 18 weeks (110225). However, when used alone, the six applications of facial peels with glycolic acid 35% is less effective than the same schedule of microneedling for improving acne scar treatment (110226).\nless\nMelasma. Topical glycolic acid, when used alone or in conjunction with other modalities. seems to improve the area and severity of mixed-type and epidermal-type melasma. However, it does not seem to be beneficial for dermal-type melasma.\nA small clinical study in females with epidermal-type and mixed-type melasma shows that applying a lotion containing glycolic acid 10% nightly for 2 weeks followed by use of a facial peel containing glycolic acid 50% once monthly for 3 consecutive months reduces pigmentation when compared with baseline (10102). This finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Another clinical study in this same population shows that use of a facial peel containing glycolic acid 70% followed by trichloroacetic acid 20% every 2 weeks for 8 sessions improves melasma area and severity when compared with baseline, but similarly to a solution containing lactic acid, salicylic acid, citric acid, and ethanol followed by trichloroacetic acid (108409). A meta-analysis of 3 small studies, including 2 randomized controlled trials and 1 prospective cohort study, has also found no difference in improvement of melasma area and severity with facial peels containing glycolic acid when compared with those containing trichloroacetic acid (108412). However, dermal-type melasma does not seem to respond to glycolic acid facial peels (10102).\n\nGlycolic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients and other modalities in patients with melasma. A small clinical study in males with mixed-type melasma shows that undergoing laser treatment followed by use of a facial peel containing glycolic acid 30% weekly for 5 weeks seems to improve skin pigmentation better than laser treatment alone (92219). Another small clinical study in females with epidermal-type or mixed-type melasma shows that microdermabrasion in combination with use of a facial peel containing glycolic acid 70% every 2 weeks for 6 sessions improves melasma area and severity more than glycolic acid alone (108411). However, adding tranexamic acid does not seem to be beneficial. A small clinical study in patients with epidermal-type melasma shows that use of a facial peel containing glycolic acid 30% every 2 weeks followed by application of tranexamic acid twice daily for 12 weeks improves melasma area and severity no differently than glycolic acid alone (108410).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nObesity. It is unclear if topical glycolic acid is beneficial in patients with obesity and pseudo-acanthosis nigricans of the neck.\nA small clinical study in adult patients with obesity and mild to moderate pseudo-acanthosis nigricans of the neck shows that applying a peel containing glycolic acid 70% every two weeks for 3 sessions reduces the severity of skin discoloration by 43%, compared with a 19% reduction in those undergoing treatment with a fractional carbon dioxide laser on a similar schedule (98607).\nless\nStretch marks (striae distensae). It is unclear if topical glycolic acid is beneficial in patients with stretch marks.\nA small clinical study in patients aged 16 years or older with stretch marks shows that applying a specific lotion containing glycolic acid 70% (NeoStrata Company) in short-contact (1- to 2-minute) skin peels once monthly for 6 months reduces the width of skin furrows and improves the color of stretch marks when compared with placebo (92216).\nless\nWater warts. It is unclear if topical glycolic acid is beneficial in children with water warts.\nPreliminary clinical research in children ages 1-15 years with water warts shows that topical treatment with 20% glycolic acid on the lesions for one hour each night for 4 weeks results in complete clearance of lesions in 56.7% of patients, compared with 63.3% of patients treated with 30% salicylic acid. However, findings were not statistically different (110217).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate glycolic acid for these uses.",

For example, glycolic acid is found in sugarcane (6064, 10104).\nDermatological effects\nHyperkeratinization is thought to contribute to acne, dry skin, and photo-aging. Alpha hydroxy acids like glycolic acid work by exfoliating the top layers of dead skin cells (948, 950, 6064, 106612). Alpha hydroxy acids seem to improve the appearance of aging skin by increasing smoothness and reducing dark spots (6064). The degree of exfoliation is determined by the type, concentration, and pH of the alpha hydroxy acid, as well as the other ingredients in the product. The lower the pH of the alpha hydroxy acid, the more rapidly it is absorbed into the skin (106612). Alpha hydroxy acids that are small in molecular size per volume are more active and penetrate the skin more deeply than larger alpha hydroxy acids. Glycolic acid is smallest in molecular size followed by lactic, pyruvic, malic, tartaric, and citric acid (10102). Glycolic acid reverses photo-damage to the skin by increasing glycosaminoglycans, including hyaluronic acid, collagen and its precursors, and factor 13A. This contributes to epidermal and dermal growth factors and mast cell degranulation, resulting in the production of thicker and less fragmented elastic fibers and an increase in epidermal volume and tightening of superficial skin layers. There is also preliminary evidence that glycolic acid stimulates fibroblasts and increases cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner to produce a new zone of collagen (10101).\n\nThe exfoliating action of alpha hydroxy acids reduces the thickness of the stratum corneum by diminishing corneocyte cohesion at the lower, newly forming levels, but not the mature upper levels, of the stratum corneum. This improves the flexibility of the stratum corneum and the skin surface. The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown. However, some researchers think alpha hydroxy acids interfere with the function of the enzymes involved in the formation of ionic sulfate and phosphate bonds in the stratum corneum (10104). There is concern, however, that the barrier function of the stratum corneum may be reduced, but evidence suggests that glycolic acid does not affect the barrier function of the stratum corneum (951, 7842).\n\nIn addition to the skin, the keratolytic effects of glycolic acid have also been evaluated on nails. A small clinical study in a mixed population of those with pathologic, hyperkeratotic nail conditions (e.g., onychomycosis, lichen planus) and those with dry, rough discolored nails due to chemical abuse shows that controlled keratolysis of the nail plate with glycolic acid 70% produces patient-reported favorable results when compared with baseline in 77% of patients (108416)."

            "Overview": "Glycomacropeptide is a 64-amino acid glycopeptide formed during cheese making (26768, 90812). To make cheese, milk is treated with the enzyme chymosin (also known as rennin). This enzyme cleaves a specific milk protein called kappa-casein into two smaller proteins: para-kappa-casein and glycomacropeptide. Para-kappa-casein becomes part of the cheese curd, and glycomacropeptide becomes part of the whey (26768, 90812, 96293). Unlike other whey proteins, glycomacropeptide contains low levels of phenylalanine, tryptophan, or tyrosine and high amounts of isoleucine and threonine (26768, 90812, 96292).",

Taking skim milk powder enriched with glycomacropeptide and G600 milk fat extract for 3 months has been associated with diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea (96291). However, rates of these effects were similar in the control group. In another clinical trial, patients taking glycomacropeptide-containing supplements reported fewer gastrointestinal side effects than patients taking amino acid-based supplements (96292).\nless\nHematologic\nSome early research raised concerns that glycomacropeptide-containing infant formulas might increase the risk of hyperthreoninemia compared to breast-milk or standard formulas without glycomacropeptide (26746, 26773).

Clinical research shows that consuming a meal-replacement supplement containing glycomacropeptide (NatraPep, MG Nutritionals) 13.5 grams twice daily for 6 months followed by once daily for an additional 6 months, along with energy restricted meals, does not increase weight loss in overweight or obese men and women when compared to using skim milk powder supplements. However, patients taking the glycomacropeptide meal-replacement supplement showed a significant reduction in weight of 10.8 kg when compared to baseline (85904).\nPhenylketonuria (PKU). Preliminary clinical research shows that replacing a phenylalanine-free amino acid supplement with a glycomacropeptide-based supplement containing glycomacropeptide plus essential amino acids, such as tyrosine, tryptophan, leucine, lysine, arginine, methionine, and histidine, for up to 1 year does not adversely affect health or renal status and maintains phenylalanine levels within the target range in adults and children with PKU (26747, 96292, 101458, 113395, 113396, 113400). When used in children 5-16 years of age, the dose of the glycomacropeptide supplement is increased gradually, while the amino acid supplement dose is decreased, with regular monitoring to maintain phenylalanine levels in the desired range. About 48% of subjects are able to switch completely to glycomacropeptide supplements, while the remaining subjects require an individualized mixture of glycomacropeptide and standard amino acid supplements (101458). Compared to the amino acid supplements, many subjects prefer glycomacropeptide-based supplements and report a subjective reduction in breath malodor (26747, 96292, 101460). Replacing all or part of daily amino acid intake with glycomacropeptide also maintains height, lean body mass, percentage body fat, bone mineral density, blood pressure, and blood biochemistry including blood urea nitrogen (113397, 113400, 113401).\nTyrosinemia. Observational research shows that using glycomacropeptide as a substitute for all or part of daily protein intake in patients with tyrosinemia is effective and safe for reducing plasma tyrosine levels and maintaining them within the desired range (113394, 113395).\nMore evidence is needed to rate glycomacropeptide for these uses.",

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGlycomacropeptide is a 64 amino acid peptide present in the whey formed during cheese making (26768, 90812, 113394, 113395). It contains threonine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, galactosamine, acetyl galactosamine, glucosamine, galactose, phosphorus, and sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) (26779, 26780, 96293, 113394). Compared with whey proteins, glycomacropeptide has low levels of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine) (26768). It typically contains about 36 mg of phenylalanine per 20 grams of protein (101458, 113400). The carbohydrate content of glycomacropeptide varies widely and depends on the isolation method (26782). Since glycomacropeptide is a protein, it may improve protein retention and phenylalanine utilization in people with phenylketonuria more than a combination of individual amino acids (26747).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nThere is interest in using glycomacropeptide for gout. Evidence from in vitro research suggests that glycomacropeptide inhibits interleukin (IL)-1beta expression in a cell model of acute gout (26753). In clinical research, a combination of skim milk enriched with glycomacropeptide and G600 milk fat, increases fractional excretion of uric acid, but does not alter serum urate levels when compared with skim milk alone, suggesting glycomacropeptide does not have uricosuric activity. The anti-gout effects of glycomacropeptide may be due to inhibition of the inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals in the joints (96291).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro research shows that glycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella flexneri to human intestinal cells, possibly by binding to the bacterial cells (26748, 26750). Other in vitro research shows that glycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of various bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mutans) to solid surfaces, suggesting that it may have a role in prevention of tooth decay (26751, 26752). Glycomacropeptide is also reported to reduce levels of Streptococcus species in the fecal microbiome (113399).\nAntidiabetic effects\nTaking glycomacropeptide 50 grams orally decreases the glycemic response to a carbohydrate load (50 grams of maltodextrin) in people with prediabetes. Both blood glucose and plasma insulin levels decrease, and the rate of gastric emptying increases. This may be due to high levels of isoleucine in glycomacropeptide, which increases glucose uptake into tissues in the presence of insulin (101461). However, in females with obesity, taking glycomacropeptide orally for 2 weeks does not change postprandial glucose, insulin, or cytokine levels, but does reduce the area under the concentration-time curve for glucagon, and increases the insulin-glucagon ratio (113399).\nAntiobesity effects\nData on the effects of glycomacropeptide on satiety are conflicting. Some studies show that it increases satiety in the short-term, but does not affect the amount of food eaten at a subsequent meal (85920). One study in females shows that glycomacropeptide stimulates release of cholecystokinin and improves satiety, while another shows an increase in postprandial amylin levels which is correlated to increased satiety (85877, 113399). Other studies show no effect of glycomacropeptide on satiety, the amount of food eaten at a subsequent meal, or weight loss (26739, 26741, 85877, 85904, 85929, 86005, 96293).\nAntiplatelet effects\nEvidence from in vitro research suggests that glycomacropeptide can inhibit thrombin and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation (26756). Also, animal research suggests that intravenous glycomacropeptide inhibits thrombogenesis by 65% (26756).\nAntitoxin effects\nEvidence from in vitro research suggests that glycomacropeptide can inhibit the binding of Cholera toxin to Chinese hamster ovarian cells and ganglioside GM1, by binding to the Cholera toxin receptor (26757).\nAntiviral effects\nEvidence from in vitro research shows that glycomacropeptide has hemagglutination inhibitory activity against influenza viruses (26758).\nGastric effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that glycomacropeptide inhibits gastric secretion (26775, 26776, 26777, 26778).\nImmunological effects\nEvidence from in vitro research shows that glycomacropeptide enhances the proliferative response and phagocytic activities of human macrophage-like cells (26764). Other in vitro research shows that glycomacropeptide inhibits the production of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, IL-6, and IL-1beta by dendritic cells (26765). Evidence from animal research shows that glycomacropeptide does not stimulate antigen-specific T cells (26761). Also, there is preliminary clinical evidence that formulas containing glycomacropeptide do not affect the development of adaptive or innate immunity in infants (26744).\nNeurological effects\nPiglets given increasing amounts of glycomacropeptide during early development exhibited enhanced learning in a maze test, and had increased expression of genes associated with learning (26766).\nPsychiatric effects\nThere is preliminary evidence that glycomacropeptide might be useful in the management of acute mania. In rats, the low levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan in glycomacropeptide reduce the levels of these amino acids in the brain, leading to reduced synthesis of dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine levels decrease in the frontal cortex, and serotonin levels decrease in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. This is associated with a reduction in symptoms in a rat model of mania (101459). In healthy human males, taking a single dose of glycomacropeptide 60 grams, with tryptophan 1.8 grams and leucine 12 grams, reduces plasma levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine, which are precursors of dopamine and serotonin when transferred into the brain (113394)."

In vitro, fractionated extracts of goat's rue showed an inhibitory effect on adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagenm and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by forming tri- and tetrapeptides (RGD, RGDS, KRDS, RGDS) with amino acids (alanine, glycine, valine, lysine, asparagine, arginine, and serine), resulting in a disaggregation effect on platelet-rich plasma (52423, 52424, 52421, 52418, 52446).\nGalactagogue effects\nSome researchers have suggested that certain constituents of goat's rue, such as saponins and coumestans, promote breast milk production by stimulating synthesis of prolactin (104533).\nWeight loss effects\nIn animal research, galegine and goat's rue (10% w/w in the diet) have shown a weight-reducing effect independent of food intake (52423, 52424, 52421, 52418, 52446); however, weight loss in genetically obese mice was accompanied by a persistent reduction in food intake (52436, 52419). Postmortem examinations of all goat's rue-treated mice revealed a striking absence of body fat. Although the weight reduction mechanism is unclear, in vitro galegine stimulated glucose uptake, inhibited lipolysis and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, and downregulated genes concerned with fatty acid synthesis (52436)."

Goji berry whole fruit, boiled or steamed, has been used with apparent safety at a dose of 15 grams daily for 16 weeks (105489). Other goji berry products have also been used with apparent safety in clinical research, including a specific goji fruit juice (GoChi, FreeLife International) 120 mL daily for 30 days (52532), a goji fruit polysaccharide 300 mg daily for 3 months (92117), and a specific milk-based formulation of goji berry (Lacto-Wolfberry, Nestlé Research Center) for 3 months (52539). There has been some concern about the atropine content of goji; however, most analyses show that levels of atropine in goji berries from China and Thailand are far below potentially toxic levels (52524, 94667).\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of oral use of other parts of the goji plant.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available.

The patient presented with a pruriginous eruption that had lasted for 2 weeks. The patient had been taking goji berries for 5 months and cat's claw for 3 months. Upon testing, it was revealed that the patient tested positive to goji berries in a photoprovocation test, but not to cat's claw (40263).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, consumption of goji berries has been associated with a single case report of autoimmune hepatitis (52541). A case of acute hepatitis has also been reported in a female who consumed 2 ounces of a specific combination product (Euforia, Nuverus International) containing goji berry, pomegranate, curcumin, green tea, noni, acai berry, aloe vera, blueberry, resveratrol, mangosteen, and black seed, daily for one month. It is unclear whether the liver injury was caused by goji berry, other ingredients, or the combination (90125).\nless\nImmunologic\nSeveral cases of allergic reactions secondary to consumption of goji berries have been reported.

It is unclear if oral goji berry reduces the risk of developing AMD.\nA small, unblinded clinical study in healthy adults aged 45 to 65 years shows that consuming goji berries 28 grams five times a week for 90 days improves macular pigment optical density, which is a marker for AMD, when compared to baseline (110767). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the other study group that received a supplement containing lutein and zeaxanthin.\nless\nCancer. Although there is interest in using oral goji for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of goji for this condition.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral goji improves risk factors for CVD.\nA meta-analysis of 6 mostly small clinical studies of adults in China shows that consuming goji as polysaccharide extract or juice for 1-3 months modestly improves triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose but does not impact total cholesterol when compared with no treatment or placebo (110765). Another meta-analysis of 4 small clinical studies in adults also shows that consuming goji polysaccharide extract or goji berries for 1-4 months modestly improves triglycerides and HDL but does not impact total or LDL cholesterol when compared with placebo or healthy eating. Goji also had no impact on systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or markers of oxidative stress (110768). However, the interpretation of the findings from these meta-analyses is limited by the use of variable goji forms and doses, as well as inclusion of studies in heterogeneous patients, including healthy people, patients with diabetes, and patients with metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, most studies were conducted in China; it is unclear if these benefits can be extrapolated to other geographic locations.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral goji berry improves cognition in healthy young individuals.\nA small clinical crossover study in healthy participants 14-24 years of age shows that taking goji berry fruit water extract (BIOMIX Company) 3600 mg in 3 divided doses daily for 4 weeks might improve certain cognitive measures such as verbal learning, short-term memory, and attention when compared with baseline (105488). The validity of these findings are limited due to incomplete outcome reporting and a lack of statistical comparisons between the treatment and placebo groups.\nless\nCough. Although there is interest in using oral goji for cough, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of goji for this purpose.\nDepression. It is unclear if oral goji berry polysaccharide is beneficial for adolescents with subthreshold depression.\nA small clinical study in adolescents aged approximately 15 years with subthreshold depression in China shows that taking goji berry polysaccharide extract 300 mg daily for 6 weeks modestly improves clinician-assessed depression scores (i.e. Hamilton Depression Scale, HAMD-24) but does not improve self-reported depression scores (i.e. Beck Depression Inventory) or scores assessing sleep quality, psychological distress, or anxiety when compared with placebo (110769). However, these results are from an interim analysis, which limits the interpretation of these findings. Furthermore, it is unclear if results can be extrapolated to patients in other geographic locations.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral goji berry polysaccharides improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes.\nOne small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking goji fruit polysaccharide powder 150 mg twice daily for 3 months results in a slightly lower postprandial glucose area under the curve (AUC), but does not seem to affect insulin levels or insulin resistance, when compared with placebo.

Although there is interest in using oral goji root bark for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of goji for this condition.\nObesity. It is unclear if oral goji berry juice improves weight loss.\nPreliminary clinical research in healthy, overweight adults shows that drinking a specific goji fruit juice (GoChi, FreeLife International LLC) 120 mL daily for 14 days while following a weight loss diet and participating in an exercise program decreases waist circumference by about 4.7 cm more than exercise and diet alone. However, drinking goji berry juice along with diet and exercise does not improve body weight, body mass index, or body fat when compared with diet and exercise alone (52536).\nless\nQuality of life. Small clinical studies suggest that oral goji berry juice may modestly improve quality of life in healthy adults.\nSmall clinical studies in healthy adults suggest that taking a specific standardized goji fruit juice (GoChi, FreeLife International LLC) 120 mL daily for 14-30 days improves subjective measures of energy levels, athletic performance, sleep quality, mental acuity, calmness, feelings of well-being, and gastrointestinal regularity when compared with placebo (17082, 52532, 52542). These studies were funded by the juice manufacturer.\nless\nSunburn. It is unclear if oral goji extract can prevent sunburn.\nA small clinical study in healthy Japanese adults shows that taking goji extract 900 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces and accelerates resolution of erythema after exposure to a standard dose of UVB irradiation when compared with placebo (110770). All study participants were highly UV-sensitive; it is unclear whether these results can be extrapolated to individuals less sensitive to UV irradiation.\nless\nTinnitus.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nFollowing oral intake of goji polysaccharides 100, 50, or 25 mg/kg in rats, the peak plasma concentration is around 7.4, 6.6, and 5.3 mg/L, respectively. These concentrations occur approximately 2 hours post-ingestion (110766).\nExcretion\nFollowing oral intake of goji polysaccharides 100, 50, or 25 mg/kg in rats, the half-life is approximately 31, 38, and 46 hours, respectively. This rat model also suggests that elimination of goji polysaccharides following oral administration is primarily in the feces and is mostly complete within 72 hours post-dose (110766).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of goji are the berries and root bark. Both contain beta-sitosterol and betaine (5814, 7123, 7126). The root bark also contains the constituent kukoamine (7123, 7126). Goji berries contain carotenoids, primarily lutein, zeaxanthin, p-coumaric acid, beta-carotene, niacin, pyridoxine, ascorbic acid, and various minerals (7123, 17082, 40451, 52493, 52518, 52522, 52545, 52552). Goji berries also contain polysaccharides, which comprise 5% to 8% of the dried fruits (92118). These polysaccharides are complex glycopeptides containing monosaccharides, amino acids, and galacturonic acid (17082). Goji berries also contain ascorbic acid. The content of ascorbic acid in the dried fruit is 0.5%, which is equivalent to the vitamin C content of fresh lemons (52490, 52515).\nAnticancer effects\nEvidence from in vitro and animal research shows that goji fruit polysaccharide can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines, including breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, leukemia, and sarcoma cell lines (52469, 52473, 52492, 52507, 52523, 52530, 92118). Other in vitro research shows that goji fruit polysaccharide can inhibit the growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells by changing the metabolism of estradiol (92118). Animal research shows that the anticancer effects of goji may be due to immunostimulant effects. Evidence from one animal model shows that goji fruit polysaccharide can increase macrophage phagocytosis of transplantable sarcoma cells (52492). Evidence from another animal model shows that goji fruit polysaccharide can increase the numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, which may enhance the antitumor function of the immune system (52513).\nAntidiabetic effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that goji fruit polysaccharide can reduce postprandial blood glucose without significantly affecting postprandial insulin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (92117). There is some speculation that goji fruit polysaccharide may reduce blood glucose without affecting insulin levels by improving beta-cell responsiveness (92117). Other evidence from animal research suggests that goji fruit polysaccharides improve blood glucose levels by upregulating the expression and improving the trafficking of glucose transporter type-4 (GLUT4). GLUT4 is the carrier that transports glucose from the blood into muscle and adipose cells (52516, 92118).\nAntifatigue effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that goji fruit polysaccharide may prevent fatigue after exercise by enhancing storage of glycogen, increasing the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, and accelerating the excretion of blood urea post-exercise (52479, 92118).\nAntimicrobial effects\nGoji root bark shows antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and C. albicans in vitro. This effect has been attributed to the lignan constituent, (+)-lyoniresinol-3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (52514). Also, phenolic amides isolated from goji root bark show antifungal activity against Candida albicans in vitro (52496).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn laboratory research and preliminary clinical studies, goji fruit has shown antioxidant activity (52529, 52534, 92118, 105555). The effect has been attributed to polysaccharide, flavonoid, and carotenoid constituents (52461, 52462, 52488, 52497, 52534, 92118, 105555). Some evidence from animal research shows that the antioxidant activity of goji fruit polysaccharides may help attenuate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (92118).\nCardiovascular effects\nGoji root bark contains the constituent kukoamine, which might have cholesterol lowering effects and antihypertensive effects (7123, 7126). Also, beta-sitosterol, a component of goji, can reduce cholesterol levels by preventing cholesterol absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (5814, 7123, 7126).Goji fruit contains polysaccharides. Animal research shows that goji fruit polysaccharides can protect the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury by decreasing the level of myocardium lactate dehydrogenase, increasing the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase and Ca-ATPase, and inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis (92118). However, early clinical research has not shown cardiovascular benefits. A small clinical study in healthy older adults shows that consuming boiled or steamed goji fruit 15 grams daily for 16 weeks does not seem to reduce blood pressure or lipid levels, or improve flow mediated dilation or other outcomes, when compared with baseline or control (105489).\nCytochrome P450 (CYP) effects\nIn vitro research shows that goji berry tea, tincture, and juice inhibit CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, CYP4A11, and CYP19 enzymes. Goji berry juice showed high-moderate inhibition of all enzymes, while goji berry tincture (80% ethanol extract) strongly inhibited CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and goji berry cold and hot water extracts showed low inhibition of most enzymes (105486).\nDermatologic effects\nIn vitro evidence suggests that glycoconjugates from goji can protect the skin cells from suboptimal conditions by decreasing the level of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (52501). Other evidence from in vitro research shows that goji berries may help protect skin cells from ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced apoptosis. This effect is attributed to the antioxidant activity of goji (52543).\nFertility effects\nGoji fruit has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat infertility. In vitro research shows that goji fruit polysaccharides can reduce time- and hypothermia-induced testicular degeneration. This effect is attributed to the antioxidant activity of goji polysaccharides (52465). Animal research shows that goji fruit polysaccharides protect against bisphenol A (BPA)-induced sperimatogenic damage. LBP also improve sexual inhibition caused by chronic corticosterone in animals (92118).\nHepatic effects\nAnimal research shows that goji fruit polysaccharides can protect the liver from alcohol- or carbon tetrachloride-induced damage. It also appears to reduce the likelihood of hepatic steatosis in animals fed a high-fat diet. These effects are attributed to the antioxidant activity of goji fruit polysaccharides (92118). Other constituents of goji fruit, including zeaxanthin, cerebrosides, and pyrrole derivatives, also seem to have hepatoprotective effects. (7125, 52452, 52468, 52552). Additionally, a clinical study in adults with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels between 35 and 105 IU/L shows that taking goji 1760 mg capsules daily for 12 weeks decreases ALT and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels when compared with placebo (112172).\nImmunologic effects\nAnimal research shows that goji fruit polysaccharide can increase peripheral white blood cells, increase peripheral platelet counts, and attenuate the decrease in peripheral red blood cells in irradiation- or chemotherapy-induced myelosuppressive mice. This effect is attributed to goji fruit polysaccharide-induced stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to produce granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (52503, 52508, 92118).\n\nOther animal research shows that goji fruit polysaccharides can stimulate cytokine production and enhance macrophage activity (92118). Also, goji fruit polysaccharides appear to increase antibody and immune responses to vaccines in animals (92118).\n\nLaboratory research shows that LBPs enhance natural killer (NK) cell function, and can promote maturation of bone marrow dendritic cells (92118).\nOphthalmic effects\nThere is interest in using goji for glaucoma. In animals using an ocular hypertension (OH) model, oral administration of goji significantly reduced the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), although elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) was not significantly altered (52525). LBPs also minimized the loss of RGCs, inhibited vascular damage and neuronal degeneration, and minimized apoptosis in both acute and chronic ocular hypertension (92118). LBPs may modulate the activation of microglia, which may lead to neuron protection. In animals, LBPs may also protect against retinal degeneration via increased levels of antioxidants and decreased oxidative stress. In retinal injuries, LBPs appear to play a protective role and increase the number of viable cells and reduce apoptosis as well as decrease oxidative stress (92118).\n\nThere is interest in using goji for macular degeneration. Lutein and zeaxanthin, both constituents of goji, are oxygenated carotenoids that have antioxidant and blue light-absorbing properties. These compounds accumulate in the macula, where they may help to prevent age-related macular degeneration (52493, 52502, 52522)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of goldenrod are the above ground parts. Goldenrod contains carbohydrates, protein, uronic acids, and inorganic material. The five main monosaccharide components identified in goldenrod are rhamnose, arabinose, uronic acid, galactose, and glucose residues (92889). Species of goldenrod contain terpenoids, saponins, phenolic acids, phenolic glycosides and high amounts of flavonoids, mainly quercetin, kaempferol, and rutin (92888). Thymol, alpha-cubebene, leiocarposide, and carvacrol are also found in goldenrod (92888, 52573). The aerial parts of European goldenrod contain virgaureasaponin 3 (52561).\nAnalgesic effects\nIn vitro, European goldenrod extract demonstrated biological activity with receptors implicated in the mediation of pain (52556).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro, a hydroalcoholic extract of goldenrod has shown anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in inflammation models (52568). In animal research, an ethanolic extract from goldenrod significantly reduced the intensity of inflammation in Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis of rat paw (52563). The anti-inflammatory effects of goldenrod may be due to the saponin and flavonoid constituents (8, 512). Leiocarposide, a constituent of goldenrod, showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects after subcutaneous administration to rats and mice (52573).\nAntifungal effects\nIn vitro, triterpenoid glycosides obtained from European goldenrod inhibited the growth of Candida and Cryptococcus species (34188, 52557). Oil made from the roots of Canadian goldenrod exhibited moderate activity against C. albicans and mild activity against A. niger. This antifungal activity is possibly attributed to thymol, carvacrol, and other terpenes present in Canadian goldenrod (92888).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, extracts of European goldenrod demonstrated amebostatic activity against pathogenic Acanthamoeba spp. (52566).\n\nOil made from the roots of Canadian goldenrod demonstrated bactericidal activity against S. aureus, B. subtilis, S. faecalis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. typhi. This antibacterial activity is possibly attributed to thymol, carvacrol, and other terpenes present in Canadian goldenrod (92888).\nAntitumor effects\nIn vitro, goldenrod species have demonstrated immunomodulatory effects on murine spleen and thymus cells and on human mononuclear cells (52580). Virgaureasaponin E, a constituent found in goldenrod, has shown in vivo antitumor effects in mice (52584). In vitro, saponins from European goldenrod showed cytotoxicity in lymphoma and mastocytoma tumor cells (52579). An active, water soluble component from European goldenrod leaves exhibited strong cytotoxic activities on various tumor cell lines, including human prostate, breast, melanoma, and small cell lung carcinoma (52560). These results were supported in a rat prostate cancer model with intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administration of a European goldenrod fraction.\nCardiovascular effects\nIn animal research, goldenrod extract demonstrated hypotensive effects (52574, 52585).\nDental effects\nThere is interest in using goldenrod extract to reduce dental plaque buildup. Some researchers have suggested that goldenrod extract inhibits genes that improve the adhesion of Candida albicans to teeth. This is also believed to reduce bacterial adherence to teeth. A small study in healthy adults shows that using a specific toothpaste (Bucovia, Givaudan) containing goldenrod extract 0.3% and sodium fluoride 0.15% twice daily for 4 weeks reduces total bacterial load and gingival index scores when compared with baseline. However, these effects were no different than a toothpaste containing only sodium fluoride 0.15% (105115).\nDiuretic effects\nIn animal research, goldenrod extract containing 0.3% flavonoids has demonstrated a significant diuretic effect in rats (52582). In one study, oral European goldenrod flavonoids stimulated a 57-88% increase in overnight diuresis, with an overnight decrease in potassium and sodium excretion and an increase in calcium excretion (52565). Leiocarposide, a constituent of goldenrod, has demonstrated a diuretic effect after oral or intraperitoneal administration to rats. This constituent has also inhibited growth of implanted human urinary calculi in the rat bladder (52583, 52570, 52571, 52572). The aquaretic effects of goldenrod may be due to the saponin and flavonoid constituents (8, 512).\nMuscular contraction activity\nIn vitro, European goldenrod extract inhibited carbachol-induced muscarinic receptor-mediated contraction of rat and human bladder tissues (52562). In animal research, a hydroethanolic extract from goldenrod inhibited acetycholine-induced contractions of guinea pig ileum (52575).\nNeurological effects\nIn animal research, goldenrod demonstrated sedative effects (52574, 52585).\nRespiratory effects\nIn guinea pigs, a complex made of the flowers of Canadian goldenrod decreased the number of cough efforts in a cough-induced model in a dose dependent manner. The effect lasted 2 hours after application with a dose of 25 mg/kg and 5 hours with doses of 50 and 75 mg/kg. However, the cough suppression was less than codeine. Intraperitoneal administration of this complex decreased specific airway resistance with a longer duration of effect when compared to intraperitoneal salbutamol. The polysaccharide components of Canadian goldenrod may contribute to the cough suppressant activity; the polyphenolic compounds could be responsible for the bronchodilation effects (92889)."

However, in one small clinical study, goldenseal did not affect the levels of indinavir, a CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy volunteers (10690, 93578). This is likely due to the fact that indinavir has a high oral bioavailability, making it an inadequate probe for CYP3A4 interactions (13536, 91740) and/or that it is primarily metabolized by hepatic CYP3A, while goldenseal has more potential to inhibit intestinal CYP3A enzyme activity (111725).

In vitro research suggests that berberine, a constituent of goldenseal, modestly inhibits P-gp efflux. Other evidence suggests that berberine induces P-gp. In healthy volunteers, goldenseal modestly increases peak levels of the P-gp substrate digoxin by about 14%. However, it does not seem to affect other pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve (AUC) (15132). This suggests that goldenseal is not a potent inhibitor of P-gp-mediated drug efflux. Until more is known, goldenseal should be used cautiously with P-gp substrates.\nless\nPENTOBARBITAL (Nembutal)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, goldenseal might increase the sedative effects of pentobarbital.\nAnimal research shows that berberine, a constituent of goldenseal, can prolong pentobarbital-induced sleeping time (13519).

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of goldenseal are the dried rhizome and root. The alkaloids hydrastine, berberine, canadine, and canadaline are the principle active constituents in goldenseal (7265, 8012). However, these alkaloids are poorly absorbed when given orally (2591) and might not reach adequate concentrations to have significant pharmacological activity in humans. The isolated constituents have a variety of pharmacological effects.\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that berberine can reduce chemical-induced swelling, possibly by inhibiting the expression of various cytokines (13529, 33639, 34298). Preliminary research suggests that berberine blocks production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL1)-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB, the transcription factor responsible for regulation of cytokine production. Berberine has potential usefulness in treating alcoholic liver disease, which is associated with increased levels of IL1-beta and TNF-alpha (13522, 33674, 34258). Berberine also appears to decrease the production of IL-8, which is involved in inflammatory processes (33592). Preliminary research suggests berberine selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression (12488, 33582, 34258). Whether goldenseal has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nAnticancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that berberine can reduce the proliferation of leukemia, myeloma, oral squamous cell, esophageal, prostate, gastric, and cervical cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and/or causing apoptosis (34196, 34202, 34219, 34222, 34229, 34233, 34236, 34237, 34238, 34315)(34323). Some preliminary research suggests that berberine can also inhibit the growth of leukemia, colon adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, astrocytoma, and glioblastoma multiform cells by inhibiting the activity of arylamine N-acetyltransferase (34197, 34198, 34206, 34214). Arylamine N-acetyltransferase has been shown to be involved in the growth and chemotherapy drug resistance of cancer (91947). Berberine also appears to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in vitro by inducing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha repression (34226).\n\nIn addition to preventing the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, berberine may also inhibit the ability of cancer to metastasize. Evidence from animal research shows that berberine can inhibit the metastasis of lung cancer to the lymph nodes (33587). In vitro research also shows that berberine can inhibit the metastasis of melanoma cells (34284).\n\nIn addition to its anticancer effects, berberine appears to enhance the effects of radiation against some types of cancer. In vitro research shows that berberine can enhance the sensitivity of glioblastoma multiforme cells to ionizing radiation (34227).\n\nWhether goldenseal has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nAntidiabetes effects\nIn humans, berberine and berberine hydrochloride have been shown to lower fasting plasma glucose (34245, 34247, 34265, 34282), post-prandial plasma glucose (34247), post-load plasma glucose (34245), and HbA1c levels (34245, 34247, 34265). The ability of berberine to lower fasting blood glucose and HbA1c appears to be similar to the effects of metformin and rosiglitazone (34265, 34282). Berberine hydrochloride has also been shown to reduce both fasting insulin level and insulin resistance (34282). The blood-glucose lowering effect of berberine has been attributed to its ability to increase insulin receptor expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with type 2 diabetes (34265). Also, evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that berberine increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity (34240, 34242, 34243). Activation of AMPK can stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscles, increase the oxidation of fatty acids in adipose tissue, and reduce the production of glucose in the liver (91948). Other evidence from animal research suggests that berberine increases glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion (34254). GLP-1 is an incretin that plays a role in the maintenance of glycemic control (91949). Also, some animal research shows that berberine can increase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and PPAR-delta expression, although berberine also appears to reduce PPAR-gamma expression in the liver of diabetic rats (34249).\n\nIn addition to lowering blood glucose, berberine might also inhibit aldose reductase (13520). This might prevent nerve and eye damage in people with diabetes.\n\nWhether goldenseal has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nAntidiarrheal effects\nSome clinical evidence shows that berberine may be effective for treating diarrhea (262, 34325, 34327, 34328). Preliminary research in healthy individuals suggests that the antidiarrheal effect of berberine results from its ability to delay small intestinal transit time (33659). Also, evidence from animal research shows that berberine can inhibit the intestinal secretion of water, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate in response to enterotoxin from Vibrio cholera and Escherichia coli (33596, 33651, 33654, 33655, 33714, 34309).\n\nWhether goldenseal has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nAntimicrobial effects\nThe berberine constituent of goldenseal has antimicrobial effects including antibacterial, antifungal, and some antimycobacterial and antiprotozoal activity (7258, 7259). Berberine has activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Shigella boydii, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporotrichum schenckii, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia lamblia (2530, 2587, 2588, 7258, 7259, 8012). The constituents canadine and canadaline have activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both berberine and canadaline have similar activity against Escherichia coli, but canadaline has been shown to have more activity against gram-positive organisms than berberine (8012). Preliminary research suggests berberine might inhibit bacterial sortase, a protein responsible for anchoring gram-positive bacteria to cell membranes (13540). The antiplasmodial activity of berberine against Plasmodium falciparum might result from its ability to inhibit telomerase activity (34213). These effects have not been demonstrated specifically for goldenseal. Due to the poor oral absorption of these alkaloids, goldenseal preparations might not be capable of achieving alkaloid serum concentrations high enough to be effective in humans. However, berberine from goldenseal is thought to concentrate in the bladder. Theoretically, goldenseal could potentially have activity against the binding of urinary tract pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, to bladder walls (2583). There is preliminary evidence goldenseal might stimulate immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody production (2530).\nAntiplatelet effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that berberine inhibits platelet aggregation (33660). In vitro research suggests that the antiplatelet effects of berberine result from its ability to inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane A2 (91950). Whether goldenseal has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nBone effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that berberine can inhibit parathyroid hormone-stimulated bone resorption (33580). In doses of 30-50 mg/kg daily, berberine has demonstrated an ability to prevent a decrease in bone mineral density of lumbar vertebra in ovariectomized rats and induce apoptosis of osteoclastic cells (33580). Whether goldenseal has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nCardiovascular effects\nBerberine also has antihypertensive, inotropic, and antiarrhythmic properties. Berberine appears to have alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. Preliminary clinical research suggests that berberine might reduce arrhythmias and improve left ventricular function in patients with heart failure (13526).\n\nIn humans, berberine has been shown to reduce levels of triglycerides (19195, 34245, 34247, 34265, 34282, 34286, 34293), total cholesterol (19195, 34245, 34247, 34282, 34286, 34293), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (19195, 34245, 34282, 34286). Some clinical studies of berberine have also observed increased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (19195, 34282, 34286), although similar effects have been inconsistent following berberine combination therapy (19195, 34283). Animal research shows that the hypocholesterolemic effects of berberine result from its ability to inhibit cholesterol absorption and increase bile acid synthesis (34264). Other animal research shows that berberine may improve lipid dysregulation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in the liver and muscles (34257).\n\nBerberine also appears to have an antihypertensive effect, which has been attributed to its ability to block alpha-adrenergic activity (13520). Other evidence from in vitro research suggests that berberine possesses partial alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist activity similar to that of clonidine (33606).\n\nBerberine may increase the elasticity of the small arteries by increasing the mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (34244). Other evidence from animal research suggests that berberine can reduce oxidative stress and vascular inflammation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase activity (34281).\n\nEvidence from animal research shows that berberine can improve neointima formation following balloon injury in rats. This suggests that berberine might be able to help control restenosis after balloon angioplasty (34231).\n\nWhether goldenseal has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nGastrointestinal effects\nBerberine appears to reduce the secretion of gastric acid (13537). Whether goldenseal has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nHepatic effects\nPreliminary research suggests berberine might protect the liver from hepatotoxins. In an animal model, berberine reduced N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced liver injury, as evidence by the attenuation of increased liver weight, elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, and increased glutathione S-transferase levels (13521). Other animal research shows that berberine prevents elevations in levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) when administered prior to exposure to acetaminophen or carbon tetrachloride (13519).\n\nOther animal research suggests that berberine has antifibrotic effects and can increase the excretion of bilirubin from the liver. This suggests that berberine may have beneficial effects in treating liver fibrosis (34302).\n\nWhether goldenseal has the same effects as berberine is unknown.\nMuscle relaxant effects\nIn vitro research shows that goldenseal extract has muscle relaxant effects (52588, 52609, 52613). This relaxation was partly blocked by the addition of propranolol to the medium, suggesting a mechanism partially mediated through beta-adrenoreceptors (52613). Also, evidence from animal research suggests that berberine, a constituent of goldenseal, can block acetylcholine-induced contraction of smooth muscles (33646, 33692)."

Long-term use of gossypol has also been reported to cause long-term, and potentially permanent, infertility in males (52743, 52749, 52706, 52817, 52813, 52746, 52745, 52739, 52756, 52824, 52795, 52819, 52711, 52630, 52689, 52817). The risk of permanent infertility appears to correlate with the dose and duration of gossypol use and may be related to smaller testicular volume and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations (52867, 52739, 52756). Several studies have also found a limited association between gossypol use and libido loss, which occurred in conjunction with loss of sperm motility and density and was correlated with dose and time of exposure to gossypol (8466, 52824, 52819). However, other human studies have not found this same association (8290, 52634, 46316, 52749, 52743).\n\nOrally, gossypol use was associated with amenorrhea in 10 of 12 patients with endometriosis (52714).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, two cases of mild thrombocytopenia have been reported after taking high doses of gossypol (52616).\nless\nHepatic\nOrally, gossypol has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity (52657, 52692). In one study, three out of 72 patients developed grade two hepatotoxicity (52616).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, several studies have found a limited association between gossypol use and fatigue (52819, 52749, 52634, 52824), while another study found no correlation (46316).\nless\nRenal\nOrally, gossypol can cause hypokalemia (46313, 52616, 52624, 52656, 52721, 52732, 52771, 52806, 52824, 52844, 52848). Hypokalemia occurs more frequently in people with potassium-deficient diets (8290, 5914, 8288) and may be caused by renal loss of potassium. Rarely, gossypol use has been reported to cause hypokalemic paralysis (46319, 52779, 52851, 52699, 52777).\n\nOrally, gossypol has been reported to exhibit a toxic effect on the renal tubules that may be caused by renal leakage of potassium (52779, 52787, 52754, 52751, 52819).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nContraception. Oral gossypol seems to reduce sperm count and inhibit sperm motility, suggesting that it may be an effective contraceptive. While these effects appear to be reversible in most patients, permanent infertility is possible.\nSeveral clinical studies show that taking gossypol 15-20 mg daily for 7-17 weeks inhibits sperm motility and production in 60% to 100% of individuals (8290, 46316, 52698, 52809, 52819). Spermatogenesis suppression is also achieved with loading doses as low as 10-12.5 mg daily, although the effect is not seen until 3-6 months of treatment (52630). Spermatogenesis suppression has been maintained for up to 22 months at maintenance doses of 7.5-10 mg daily or 20 mg given 1-5 times weekly (8290, 46316, 52698, 52809, 52819). Normalization of sperm function returns within three months to two years after discontinuation of treatment in about 50% to 77% of individuals (8290, 52698, 52809). However, due to the risk for permanent infertility, gossypol is not recommended for use as a contraceptive (5914, 52803).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nLung cancer.

Also, a small clinical study in adults with recurrent NSCLC shows that taking this same gossypol product 20 mg daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle does not inhibit tumor progression or induce tumor regression (99816). Another small clinical study in patients with advanced NSCLC shows that taking gossypol acetate 20 mg daily for the first 2 weeks of each 4-week chemotherapy cycle, which included docetaxel and cisplatin, does not improve progression-free survival or overall survival when compared with placebo plus chemotherapy (107925).\nless\nProstate cancer. Clinical research suggests that oral gossypol does not improve survival rates or prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients with prostate cancer.\nOne clinical study in patients with progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer shows that taking a product containing the R-(-)-enantiomer of gossypol (AT-101, Ascenta Therapeutics) 40 mg twice daily for the first 3 days of each 3-week treatment cycle, which included treatment with docetaxel and prednisone, does not improve overall survival when compared with placebo (99820). Also, a small clinical study in patients with metastatic prostate cancer shows that taking the same gossypol product 20 mg daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle of androgen deprivation therapy does not increase the number of patients with an undetectable PSA level (99818).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nCancer. It is unclear if oral gossypol is beneficial in patients with advanced cancer.\nA small clinical study in patients with advanced cancer of various origins shows that taking gossypol 30-180 mg weekly for up to 21 weeks, followed by escalating doses of gossypol 30 mg twice weekly to 30 mg twice daily, does not increase tumor regression (52654).\nless\nEndometriosis. Although there has been interest in oral gossypol for endometriosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gossypol for this purpose.\nHead and neck cancer. It is unclear if oral gossypol is beneficial in patients with head and neck cancer.\nA small clinical study in adults with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma shows that taking a product containing the R-(-)-enantiomer of gossypol (AT-101, Ascenta Therapeutics) 40 mg twice daily for the first 3 days or 20 mg daily for the first 2 weeks of each 3-week treatment cycle, which also included treatment with docetaxel, does not improve response rate or clinical benefit rate when compared with docetaxel alone (99819).\nless\nHIV/AIDS.

Toxic effects of gossypol are more likely in patients using gossypol long-term or at doses greater than 20 mg daily.\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with gossypol.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAfter oral administration, gossypol is absorbed through the intestine as well as through the epithelial lining of the stomach (46318).\nDistribution\nGossypol is highly bound to amino acids and to dietary iron (52760). It competes with bilirubin for a high-affinity binding site on human serum albumin, and similar competition between bilirubin and gossypol occurs with binding to the glutathione S-transferases from human liver and placenta (52823, 52655, 52760). (-)-Gossypol, but not (+)-gossypol, binds to free amino groups on protein, which may account for some of the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic differences between the two isomers (52705).\nExcretion\nConjugation, metabolism, and urinary excretion of gossypol is limited; most is eliminated in the feces (52752). In humans, the elimination half-life of (+)-gossypol is up to 29 times longer than that of (-)-gossypol. The peak plasma concentration and area under the curve of (-)-gossypol is significantly greater than that of (+)-gossypol (52766). The average elimination half-life of racemic gossypol in humans is 286 hours (52766).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGossypol is a pigment that occurs in nature as a racemic mixture of enantiomers (52639, 52819).\nAbortifacient effects\nIn animal research, gossypol disrupted estrous cycles, pregnancy, and early embryo development (52665). Luteolytic activity is proposed to be the main mechanism of action for the termination of early pregnancy by gossypol, although the direct damaging effects on decidual cells and cytotrophoblasts may also play a role (52636).\nAnticancer effects\nStudies show that gossypol slows the growth of cancer in vitro and in animals (52635, 5915, 52677, 52719, 52641, 52621, 52861, 52671, 52643, 52657, 52652, 52672, 52833, 52719, 52647, 52869, 52683, 52862, 52843, 52773, 52700, 52728, 52670, 52815, 52627, 52769, 52669, 8294, 52822). However, clinical research in humans has found no benefit of gossypol or a specific standardized gossypol product (AT-101, Ascenta Therapeutics) for various forms of advanced cancer (52654, 99816, 99817, 99818, 99819, 99820).\n\nIn vitro and in animals, tumor cells were found to be more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of gossypol than normal cells (52759). Gossypol treatment is associated with the following apoptosis-related events: DNA fragmentation, poly(ADP) ribose polymerase cleavage, truncation of Bid protein, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release from mitochondria into cytosol, nuclear condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies, membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage and loss of adherence, involvement of c-fos protein, down-regulation of Bag-1 and Mcl-1, up-regulation of Fas/FasL, activation of caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, and -9, up-regulation of Apaf-1, and activation of DFF45 (52647, 52864, 8289, 52671, 52663, 52832, 52659, 52677, 52628, 52868, 52673, 52669). There is disagreement in the literature regarding whether the p53 and p21/WAF1 pathways are involved (52669, 52670, 52628). It is also unclear whether Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Bax, and Bak are involved (52677, 52647, 52661). Gossypol treatment is also associated with cell cycle arrest involving an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase (52860, 52683, 52862, 8291, 52815), although there is some evidence of arrest of cells in mid-S phase (52712).\n\nIn vitro, (-)-gossypol exhibits stronger antiproliferative activity than (+)-gossypol (52759, 52769, 52639, 52700). However, clinical research on a standardized product (AT-101, Ascenta Therapeutics) containing only R-(-)-gossypol has not shown benefit for various forms of advanced cancer in humans (99816, 99817, 99818, 99819, 99820).\nAntifertility effects\nGossypol has been extensively studied as a male contraceptive (52744, 52801, 52826, 52820, 52695, 52790, 52798, 52746, 52745, 52829, 52784) (52778, 52702, 52701, 52617, 52686, 46318, 52800, 52631, 52682, 52664, 52668). Gossypol produces a high degree of antifertility activity in male and female animals (46318, 52845, 52687, 52755, 52774, 52828, 52663, 52830). Inhibition of both acrosomal plasminogen activator and plasmin activity is a possible mechanism by targeting ovum fertilization (52620). In humans, gossypol has been found to reduce the sperm count by 99% (52717, 52819, 52758).\n\nGossypol inhibits basal secretions of progesterone (52636, 52693) and alters the binding capacity of the cytosolic progesterone receptor (52838). In vitro, gossypol inhibits testosterone synthesis in interstitial cells (52813, 52852).\n\nMany studies indicate that gossypol interferes with spermatogenesis (8290, 52748, 52850, 52726), although some research shows that gossypol also affects the locomotory system of mature spermatozoa and causes sperm to become immotile (52825, 52696, 52819, 52718, 52772, 52758, 52733, 52805, 52802, 52813, 52797, 8466), which may occur through inhibition of cAMP formation (52726, 52842, 52680, 52853). There is evidence that inhibition of sperm motility after gossypol treatment may be due to inhibition of the ATPase activity in the spermatozoa (52733, 52805, 52632, 52713). In animal research, gossypol reduced the velocity and frequency of sperm head rotation, as well as the linearity of sperm progression, and also altered the ability of human spermatozoa to penetrate cervical mucus (52824). In rats, exposure to gossypol reduced the content of cellular and microtubular tubulin found in sperm (52856). The liquefaction of freshly ejaculated human semen was delayed by gossypol (52775). In clinical research, after application of a gossypol gel, sperm cells were immobilized in human cervical mucus and total sperm count was reduced (52790, 8906).\n\nOf the many gossypol analogs evaluated in various studies, none exhibit the same magnitude of antifertility effect as gossypol itself (52764, 52867). Examples of such analogs include gossypolone (a proposed major gossypol metabolite) (52810), gossypol ethylimine (52662), and dithiane or dithiolane derivatives (52646). It is believed that the isopropyl moiety of the gossypol molecule is essential for its mechanism of action and that the whole ring structure of gossypol is required for effective inhibition of spermatozoal energy metabolism (52770). (-)-Gossypol seems to be more potent than (+)-gossypol as an antifertility agent (52759, 52769, 52639, 52726, 52864, 52752).\nAntimalarial effects\nIn vitro, gossypol exhibits antimalarial activity (52666, 52695).\nAntiparasitic effects\nIn vitro, gossypol inhibits Trypnosone and Plasmodium, which cause chagas disease and malaria, respectively (52695). The periacylated gossylic nitriles inhibit parasite lactate dehydrogenase (52762).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, gossypol is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase inhibitor (52644, 8462, 52839, 52865, 46290, 52715). There are conflicting reports on the ability of gossypol to limit multiplication of herpes virus (52798, 52653). Certain gossypol derivatives have strong antiviral activities (52685); (-)-gossypol has been suggested to be the most potent antiviral enantiomer (52715).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that gossypol alters vasodilation and vasorelaxation (52708, 52747, 52723, 52709, 52854). In vitro, gossypol is an irreversible inhibitor of the production or release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) that is involved in endothelium-dependent vasodilation (52710).\nIon transport effects\nGossypol seems to affect the transport of various ions. Laboratory research shows that gossypol inhibits ion transport of phosphate, sulfur, and chloride by approximately 90% (52786). In rats fed a low potassium diet, gossypol reduced the intracellular magnesium and potassium concentrations of the skeletal muscle, although this effect was not observed in regularly fed rats (52777). Gossypol is noncompetitive with ATP, magnesium, sodium, and potassium (52721, 52732). There is conflicting evidence regarding whether gossypol inhibits the sodium potassium ATPase (52720, 52722, 52734, 52713, 52796).\n\nGossypol also affects calcium transport. Gossypol inhibited calcium influx through channels in sperm cells in a noncompetitive manner (52863, 52834, 11132, 52713), and there are conflicting opinions on whether this affects sperm motility (11132, 52660). In human cell types, gossypol induced significant calcium increases in cells by releasing calcium from intracellular pools and from the external space (52640, 52622, 52658). Gossypol was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of calcineurin (52637).\n\nThe most common side effect reported during gossypol use is hypokalemia (52754, 46317, 46316, 52757, 46316, 52751). Suggested mechanisms include inhibition of sodium potassium ATPase activity, modification of membrane transport, and damage to the renal tubule (52777, 166, 52719).\nMembrane effects\nMost biological activities of gossypol are caused by inhibition of dehydrogenases (52621). Gossypol has inhibitory actions on many membrane-associated enzymes, suggesting that this agent might have a generalized effect on cell membranes. It is soluble in lipids and binds to cell membranes (52699). Gossypol alters cell membrane viscosity (52719, 52703). By inhibiting ion transport pumps, gossypol may induce changes in the lipid microenvironment of membranes (52713).\nMetabolic effects\nGossypol binds covalently to microsomal proteins, which may affect metabolism of sterols, steroids, or fatty acids (52678). Gossypol inhibits the activity of phospholipase (52785), human class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase (52858), angiotensin converting enzyme (52724, 52735), liver NADP-glutamate dehydrogenase (52768), lipoxygenase (52859, 52857, 52855, 52835, 52648), aldose reductase (52615, 52691), dioxygenase (52623, 52846), LDH (52619), glucelaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (52619), hydroperoxidase (52846), sialyl transferase (52690), 11(-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) (52624, 52656), the proenzyme form of human seminal plasma acidic proteinase (52737), 3(-HSD (52636), adenyl cyclase (52636), human sperm acrosomal proteinase (52818), acid phosphate (52714), protein kinase C (52619), nonspecific esterase (52714), alkaline phosphate (52714), glutathione-S-transferase (52700), malate dehydrogenase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (52622, 52694, 52768).

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally and topically, gotu kola seems to be well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Gastric irritation and nausea.\n\nTopically: Eczema.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Hepatotoxicity.\nDermatologic\nTopically, gotu kola may cause eczema (10277, 10278). Also, gotu kola can cause allergic contact dermatitis, characterized by erythema, itching, papules, and a burning sensation (4, 6887, 9789, 52875, 52887, 52896, 52902). One specific gotu kola product (Blasteostimulina,Almirall, S. A.) has been reported to cause allergic contact dermatitis. However, not all patients with reactions to this product are sensitive to gotu kola; some patients are sensitive to neomycin, another ingredient in the product (52875). Madecassol ointment (Rona Laboratories Limited) is another gotu kola product that has resulted in allergic contact dermatitis. Controlled testing suggests that this product can cause this adverse effect in about 8% of patients (9789). Centellase cream has also caused allergic contact dermatitis in at least two cases (52887, 52888).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nIn some patients, gotu kola can extract cause gastrointestinal upset and nausea (780, 6887, 52894).\nless\nHepatic\nThere is concern that gotu kola may cause liver toxicity in some patients. There are at least four case reports of hepatotoxicity associated with gotu kola; however, hepatotoxic contaminants cannot be ruled out, as laboratory analysis was not conducted on the products used. Additionally, the doses of gotu kola used in these cases were not reported (13182, 92506). In a clinical trial where liver function was monitored, taking gotu kola 120 mg daily for 6 months was not associated with changes in liver function (11065).\n\nIn one case of hepatotoxicity, a 61-year-old female developed elevated liver transaminase and total bilirubin levels after taking gotu kola tablets for 30 days. Liver biopsy showed granulomatous acute hepatitis. Months later, the patient took gotu kola again and developed elevated liver transaminases after 2 weeks. In another case, a 52-year-old female developed symptoms of hepatitis and increased liver transaminases after taking gotu kola for 3 weeks. Biopsy indicated chronic hepatitis and granulomas, areas of necrosis, and cirrhotic transformation. Liver function normalized after discontinuation of gotu kola. In a third case, a 49-year-old female developed symptoms of hepatitis after taking gotu kola for 2 months. Biopsy revealed granulomatous hepatitis. Liver function normalized after discontinuation of gotu kola (13182). In a fourth case, a 15-year-old female taking an unknown dose of gotu kola and lymecycline for 6 weeks for acne experienced acute liver failure with abdominal pain and vomiting, as well as elevated liver transaminases, bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), and prothrombin. Liver function returned to normal after both products were discontinued (92506).\nless\nImmunologic\nTopically, gotu kola can cause allergic contact dermatitis, characterized by erythema, itching, papules, and a burning sensation (4, 6887, 9789, 52875, 52887, 52896, 52902).

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nBurns. Topical gotu kola seems to improve the rate of burn healing.\nClinical research shows that applying a cream containing gotu kola 3% once daily to second degree burns increases the rate of re-epithelialization and complete healing by about 7 days when compared with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) 1% cream. Gotu kola cream also seems to reduce dryness, itching, irritation, and scar severity when compared with SSD (97027). Other research in adults with second degree burns shows that applying a gauze dressing containing gotu kola 5% and aloe 2.5%, covered with absorbent cotton wool and changed every 3 days, reduces time to healing by 1.5 days and length of hospital stay by 1.7 days when compared with the use of a gauze dressing containing chlorhexidine acetate 0.5% (97028).\nless\nVenous insufficiency. Oral gotu kola seems to improve symptoms of venous insufficiency.\nClinical research shows that taking gotu kola or a specific extract of gotu kola (Centellase) 60-180 mg daily orally for 4-8 weeks seems to improve measures of circulation and decrease symptoms such as edema in patients with venous insufficiency (6887, 9786, 11063, 11064, 11066, 11070, 52894, 52909).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nCognitive function. Oral gotu kola does not seem to be beneficial for cognitive function.\nA meta-analysis of a small number of generally moderate quality clinical trials shows that taking a single dose of gotu kola, alone or in combination with other ingredients, does not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo (105334). In one study, gotu kola was taken in combination with ginkgo and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for 4 months by healthy, cognitively intact older adults (52880).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. Topical gotu kola does not seem to reduce symptoms of radiation dermatitis.\nClinical research in females undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer shows that applying a cream containing gotu kola extract 7% once daily during and up to 4 weeks following radiotherapy does not reduce the severity of dermatitis when compared with no treatment or applying a moisturizing cream (102792).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAging skin. Oral gotu kola has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small clinical study in healthy, middle-aged females shows that applying a topical emulsion containing extracts of gotu kola 3% and Indian gooseberry 3% twice daily for 60 days improves skin hydration, some measures of skin wrinkles, and elasticity of the cheek (but not the eye) when compared with placebo (111571). It is unclear if these effects are due to gotu kola, Indian gooseberry, or the combination.\nless\nAlzheimer disease. Although there is interest in using oral gotu kola for Alzheimer disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gotu kola for this condition.\nAnal fissures. It is unclear if topical gotu kola is beneficial for anal fissures.\nIn patients with chronic anal fissures who are using standard dietary and hygiene treatments, preliminary clinical research shows that taking gotu kola extract 60 mg twice daily for 8 weeks and locally applying an ointment containing gotu kola does not reduce the mean time to bleeding cessation when compared with standard treatments alone. However, pain may be modestly improved. Also, gotu kola was less effective than an unspecified flavonoid mixture used both orally and topically (105332).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. It is unclear if oral gotu kola is beneficial for slowing the progression of atherosclerotic plaques.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking gotu kola extract 60 mg orally three times daily for 12 months helps stabilize low-density atherosclerotic plaques when compared with placebo (11062, 11069).\n\nGotu kola has also been evaluated in combination with a specific maritime pine bark product (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research). A non-randomized clinical trial shows that taking gotu kola 225 mg and Pycnogenol 150 mg in two divided doses daily for 3 months reduces plaque height and length and increases plaque echogenicity and stability when compared to control (97030). Another non-randomized clinical study in adults with atherosclerotic plaques and no other cardiovascular risk factors shows that taking gotu kola extract 100 mg and Pycnogenol 100 mg daily for up to 4 years reduces plaque progression and increases plaque echogenicity when compared with Pycnogenol alone or no treatment at all. Taking gotu kola and Pycnogenol is also associated with a reduced rate of clinical vascular events, including angina, myocardial infarction, minor transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and minor strokes when compared with taking Pycnogenol alone or receiving no treatment at all (97029). It is unclear how these outcomes would compare to the use of gotu kola alone.\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Topical gotu kola has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying an ointment containing 5% each of the extracts of heart's ease, gotu kola, and Oregon grape twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve eczema when compared with a base cream. However, patients with eczema on skin exposed to cold weather might experience some improvement (67372).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there is interest in using oral gotu kola for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gotu kola for this condition.\nDepression. Although there is interest in using oral gotu kola for depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gotu kola for this condition.\nDiabetic foot ulcers. Topical gotu kola has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn patients with deep diabetic foot ulcers, preliminary clinical research shows that applying a cream (WH-1 cream) containing 1.25% of gotu kola and Plectranthus amboinicus extracts in a 4:1 ratio twice daily for 2 weeks after surgical debridement is as effective as the use of a standard hydrocolloid fiber wound dressing for improving wound size. However, when compared with baseline, changes in wound size were not statistically significant (105335).\nless\nDiabetic microangiopathy. It is unclear if oral gotu kola is beneficial for diabetic microangiopathy.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking gotu kola extract 60 mg orally twice daily for 6-12 months helps increase measures of circulation and decrease edema in patients with diabetic microangiopathy (11065, 11068, 52917).\nless\nDry skin. It is unclear if topical gotu kola is beneficial for dry skin.\nIn patients with dry skin associated with type 2 diabetes, clinical research shows that topical application with 0.25 grams of a gotu kola 1% ointment twice daily, either alone or with oral gotu kola 1100 mg twice daily, for 28 days does not improve dry skin when compared with placebo. However, in a sub-group of patients with well-controlled diabetes, the combination of oral and topical gotu kola modestly improved dry skin (105329). Additionally, a small clinical study in individuals with dry skin due to working with synthetic and natural dyes shows that application of a gotu kola 2% ceramide-based cream to the hands and arms twice daily for 4 weeks improves skin barrier hydration, as measured by hydration of the stratum corneum and skin acidity, when compared to baseline. These improvements were similar to those seen with a ceramide 5% cream (109554). As the gotu kola cream was formulated with ceramide, it is unclear if these findings are due to gotu kola, ceramide, or the combination.\nless\nEpilepsy. Although there is interest in using oral gotu kola for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gotu kola for this condition.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is unclear if oral gotu kola is beneficial for GAD.\nIn patients with GAD, preliminary clinical research shows that taking gotu kola extract 500 mg twice daily for 60 days reduces symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress by 22% to 26% when compared with baseline (105333). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHemorrhoids. It is unclear if topical gotu kola is beneficial for hemorrhoids.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with chronic hemorrhoids, as well as patients with acute symptoms following a hemorrhoidectomy or surgical treatment for hemorrhoidal thrombosis, shows that taking gotu kola extract (Centella complex) 60 mg twice daily for 15 weeks and locally applying an ointment (Proctocella) containing gotu kola, arnica, and aloe, in conjunction with standard treatments, does not reduce the mean time to bleeding cessation when compared with standard treatments alone. Anal irritation was modestly improved in the patients with chronic hemorrhoids and in those undergoing treatment for hemorrhoidal thrombosis, but not in those that had undergone a hemorrhoidectomy (105336).\nless\nHerpes zoster (shingles). Although there is interest in using oral gotu kola for shingles, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gotu kola for this condition.\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral gotu kola is beneficial for hypertension.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with hypertension shows that drinking a tea made by boiling gotu kola 4 grams in 250 mL water three times daily for 3 days modestly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with baseline. After consuming the tea, about 40% of patients had normal or high-normal systolic blood pressure and 77% had optimal or normal diastolic blood pressure, compared with 0% and 45%, respectively, prior to consumption (105330). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHypertrophic scars. Topical gotu kola has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that topical use of a specific silicone gel (Bangkok Botanica) containing 15% extracts of gotu kola, onion, aloe, and paper mulberry, starting 2 weeks after surgery and continuing for 6 months, moderately improves the height and pliability of the post-surgical hypertrophic scar when compared with a silicone placebo gel. There was no effect on pigmentation or vascularity (102793). It is unknown whether any benefit is related to gotu kola, other ingredients, or their combination.\nless\nIdiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Oral gotu kola has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small observational registry study in males less than 65 years old with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia has found that taking a specific gotu kola extract (Centellicum; Horphag Research) 225 mg three times daily in combination with a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) 50 mg three times daily for 8 months is associated with a modest improvement in Karnofsky Performance Scale scores and a reduction in fatigue when compared with pirfenidone (108862). However, the validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded, non-randomized nature of the study.\nless\nKeloids. It is unclear if oral or topical gotu kola are beneficial for keloids.\nThere is some early evidence that applying a specific extract of gotu kola (Madecassol) topically might help reduce keloids and hypertrophic scarring (13558). Gotu kola has also been taken orally for keloids. Preliminary clinical research in patients at high risk for keloids shows that taking a specific extract of gotu kola (Centellicum, Horphag Research Ltd) 450 mg daily for 4 weeks starting on the second week after surgery seems to improve scar homogeneity and regularity (99756). However, the reliability of these results is limited because patients in this study were not randomized or blinded to different interventions.\nless\nLaser skin resurfacing. It is unclear if topical gotu kola is beneficial for recovery from laser skin resurfacing.\nA small clinical trial shows that applying a gel containing gotu kola extract (ECa 233) 0.05% four times daily for 7 days, then twice daily for 3 months, improves wound healing following laser resurfacing for facial acne. Redness returned to baseline levels by day 7, in contrast to day 28 on the side treated with a placebo gel. The general wound appearance and crusting were also improved on the side on which the gotu kola extract gel was applied (102794).\nless\nOsteoarthritis. Topical gotu kola has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large, single-blind clinical study in adults with knee osteoarthritis causing moderate pain shows that applying a specific cream (TMP-4) containing extracts of gotu kola leaf, sesame seed, soybean, and mangosteen peel four times daily for 4 weeks provides similar improvement in pain scores when compared with diclofenac 1% gel. Topical TMP-4 cream also seems to improve knee stiffness, stair climbing, and mobility similarly to diclofenac gel. However, patient impression of overall improvement was higher with diclofenac (110128). The validity of this study is limited by inadequate blinding.\nless\nScarring. It is unclear if topical gotu kola is beneficial for scarring or tenderness from scarring.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients without a history of keloid formation suggests that applying a specific cream (Alpha Centella, not available in the US) containing gotu kola and Bulbine frutescens extracts twice daily for 6-8 weeks following suture removal might help to reduce scarring (11072). Also, a large clinical study in adults who underwent carpal tunnel release surgery shows that applying gotu kola cream 1% three times daily for 6 months after suture removal marginally improves self-reported scar tenderness pain when compared with control, and modestly improves scarring scores when compared to baseline (112425). However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by patient-reported outcomes and insufficient validity of the scar scoring tool in this population.\nless\nSkin grafts. Although there is interest in using topical gotu kola for skin graft recovery, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gotu kola for this condition.\nStretch marks (striae distensae). It is unclear if oral gotu kola is beneficial for stretch marks; topical gotu kola has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with stretch marks shows that taking a specific extract of gotu kola (Centellicum, Horphag Research Ltd) 225 mg three times daily for 6 weeks increases skin thickness, elasticity, and perfusion when compared with a stretch mark minimizer cream (Clarins) and regular control cream (99757). The validity of these results is limited by the fact that patients were not randomized or blinded to the different interventions.\n\nGotu kola has also been evaluated topically in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific mixture of gotu kola, vitamin E, and collagen-elastin hydrolysates in a cream (Trofolastin, not available in the US) daily during the second and third trimesters reduces stretch marks when compared with a placebo cream (13559). Another small clinical study shows that applying a specific mixture of gotu kola, vitamin E, essential fatty acids, hyaluronic acid, elastin, and menthol in an ointment (Verum, not available in the US) helps decrease the formation of stretch marks during pregnancy when compared with placebo (11073). Other preliminary clinical research in patients without previous striae shows that applying a specific formula containing hydroxyprolisilane C, rosehip oil, gotu kola triterpenes, and vitamin E (Velastisa Antiestrías, ISDIN) twice daily, beginning at week 10-14 and continuing throughout pregnancy, decreases the severity of both new and old stretch marks and the incidence of stretch marks when compared with placebo (92507). It is unclear if the effects seen in these studies are due to gotu kola, other ingredients, or the combinations.\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although there is interest in using oral gotu kola for SLE, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gotu kola for this condition.\nTonsillitis. Although there is interest in using oral gotu kola for tonsillitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gotu kola for this condition.\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE). It is unclear if oral gotu kola is beneficial for VTE prevention.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that gotu kola decreases edema and improves measures of circulation in patients traveling on airplanes for more than 3 hours when compared to a control group receiving no treatment (11067). However, it is unknown if these changes reduce the incidence of clots.\nless\nWound healing. Although there is interest in using topical gotu kola for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of gotu kola for this purpose.\nWrinkled skin. It is unclear if topical gotu kola is beneficial for wrinkled skin.\nSmall, low-quality studies in healthy adults suggest that topical formulations of gotu kola extract or the constituent asiaticoside 0.1% or 0.2% applied 1-3 times daily have shown modest benefit for wrinkled skin. Cream or gel formulations were used for 12 weeks for periorbital wrinkles and a lipstick was used for 8 weeks for lip wrinkles. However, the extent of benefit is not clear and meta-analyses are limited to a very small number of studies with varied comparator groups, including placebo, vehicle, tretinoin 0.02%, and Pueraria mirifica extract (106639).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate gotu kola for these uses.",

            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with gotu kola.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nAnimal research suggests that the bioavailability of the gotu kola constituents madecassoside, asiaticoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid ranges from 30% and 50% (52923). In humans, asiaticoside and madecassoside from gotu kola are not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. These constituents contain large hydrophilic sugars that do not easily permeate the intestinal barrier and are resistant to gastric acid and digestive enzymes. Clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that the maximum concentration of these poorly absorbed constituents occurs 1-2 hours after ingestion of a standardized gotu kola extract (ECa 233) 250-500 mg (99758, 105331). In cognitively impaired older adults on cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, the time to peak plasma concentration of asiatic acid and madecassic acid is around 2 hours after a single 2-gram or 4-gram dose of a standardized gotu kola extract (109555).\nDistribution\nThe time to peak plasma concentration of the total triterpenic fraction of gotu kola does not appear to differ for single versus chronic doses, but area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours is higher after chronic dosing than single doses (52884). Repeated dosing of a standardized gotu kola extract (ECa 233) over 7 days shows evidence of accumulation of asiatic acid (105331).\nMetabolism\nClinical research in healthy volunteers shows that the gotu kola constituent asiaticoside is converted to asiatic acid by hydrolytic cleavage of the sugar moiety by enzymes from intestinal bacteria (52899, 99758, 105331, 109555). Clinical research also shows that the gotu kola constituent madecassoside is hydrolyzed into madecassic acid (99758, 105331, 109555).\nExcretion\nClinical research in healthy volunteers shows that specific constituents of gotu kola, madecassoside and asiaticoside, but not their metabolites, are excreted in the urine within 4-24 hours after a single dose (105331). However, research in older adults taking a standardized gotu kola extract shows that only trace amounts of asiaticoside, madecassoside, and their metabolites are renally excreted within 10 hours (109555). Most evidence shows that the gotu kola constituents and metabolites are excreted predominantly in feces (13558, 105331, 109555). The half-life of madecassic acid is around 1.7 hours, and the half-life of asiatic acid ranges from 2.2 to 3.8 hours in older adults taking a single 2- or 4-gram dose of gotu kola extract (109555).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of gotu kola are the above ground parts. The primary constituents responsible for the pharmacological effects are thought to be the saponin-containing triterpene acids, 1% to 8%; and their sugar esters, including asiatic acid, madecassic acid, asiaticoside A (madecassoside), and asiaticoside B (6887, 11071). Gotu kola also contains essential oils; flavonoids; and flavone derivatives including quercetin and kaempferol, sesquiterpenes, stigmasterol, sitosterol, and isothankuniside (6887, 10276). Gotu kola leaves contain calcium, phosphorus, iron, potassium, beta-carotene, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C (6887).\nAnti-fertility effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests that purified isothankuniside might decrease fertility. However, a crude extract of gotu kola does not reduce fertility (10276).\nAnticancer effects\nThere is some interest in using gotu kola to treat cancer. Dried powder extracts of gotu kola exhibit cytotoxic and anti-tumor properties in preliminary in vitro studies. Normal lymphocytes are not harmed, which suggests gotu kola exerts selective toxicity towards tumor cells (7692).\nAntimicrobial effects\nGotu kola extracts seem to have antibacterial activity in vitro against Pseudomonas pyocyaneus, Trichoderma mentagrophytes, and Entamoeba histolytica (6887). It also seems to have antiviral activity against Herpes simplex type II (6887, 52872, 52886).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe triterpenoid saponins (e.g., asiaticoside, madecassoside) seem to increase wound healing and decrease venous pressure in venous insufficiency (780, 2700, 9786). The terpenoid extract seems to improve connective tissue remodeling by increasing fibroblast activity, stimulating collagen synthesis, increasing epithelial turnover over, and decreasing capillary permeability (11061, 11062, 11065).\n\nThe terpenoid extract might help stabilize arterial plaques by increasing collagen within plaques. Plaques with low collagen content are structurally weak and are associated with an increased risk of rupture and embolism (11062, 11069).\nGastrointestinal effects\nLaboratory research suggests that asiaticosides might have preventive and therapeutic effects on gastrointestinal ulcers (6887, 7691). Anti-ulcer mechanisms may be due to strengthening action on gastric mucosal lining, increased mucin secretion, and suppression of damaging effects of free radicals (7691, 52873). Also, asiaticoside and other terpenoids in gotu kola might improve gastric ulcer healing through anti-inflammatory activity (13560). In addition, some preliminary research shows that gotu kola reduces physiological stress-induced gastric ulcers by increasing GABA levels (52874).\nHepatic effects\nThere are some case reports of hepatotoxicity with gotu kola. The triterpenoids contained in gotu kola are theorized to be responsible for this adverse effect. These constituents are thought to induce hepatic injury by promoting apoptosis and altering cell membranes (13182). However, the products used by these patients were not tested for hepatotoxic contaminants; it is unclear if gotu kola was the causative factor in these reports.\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nAnimal research shows that gotu kola extract can protect the brain from glutamate-induced oxidative damage and excitotoxicity. This suggests that gotu kola may be beneficial for certain neurodegenerative conditions, such as epilepsy and stroke, in which glutamate is known to play a role in the pathogenesis (52881).\n\nSome researchers think the asiaticoside derivatives, asiatic acid, asiaticoside 6, and SM2, might have a role in Alzheimer disease. Preliminary research also suggests that they might protect neurons from beta-amyloid toxicity (1889).\n\nIn vitro evidence suggests that gotu kola might bind cholecystokinin (CCK) and GABA receptors, which might be responsible for reported anxiolytic effects of gotu kola (6687, 11071). The effects on GABA might also results in sedative, anticonvulsant, and analgesic effects (6887). There is some evidence that taking gotu kola orally might to reduce the startle response in healthy volunteers (11071).\nWound healing effects\nGotu kola is thought to increase the production of type I collagen in scar formation over type II. Type II collagen is associated with hypertrophic scarring (11072, 52901).\n\nThere is also some evidence that asiaticosides might promote wound healing by stimulating collagen and glycosaminoglycan synthesis (1890, 2700, 52889, 52903, 52904). Also, asiaticoside and other terpenoids might have improve healing and scar formation via anti-inflammatory activity (11072). Also, preliminary research shows that asiaticosides increase levels of antioxidants in the wound during the proliferative phase of wound healing, which may prevent oxidative damage during healing (52870)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of grains of paradise are the seeds. The major constituents of grains of paradise seed are the vanilloid compounds 6-gingerol, 6-paradol, and 6-shogaol (99893).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro and animal research shows that grains of paradise seed extract and its constituents 6-gingerol, 6-paradol, and 6-shogaol have anti-inflammatory activity via inhibition of COX-2 activity and pro-inflammatory gene expression. The effect of 6-shogaol on inflammation is similar to aspirin (99889).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research shows that certain labdane diterpenes isolated from the rhizome of grains of paradise have more potent antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus than gentamicin, more potent activity against Listeria monocytogenes than ampicillin, and more potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than vancomycin. The mechanism of these effects is unclear but may include inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis (99891).\nHepatic effects\nAnimal research shows that grains of paradise seed extract, in doses of 450 mg/kg and 1500 mg/kg, causes liver enlargement and an elevation in alkaline phosphatase levels in rats (17207). However, in vitro research suggests that phenolic constituents of grains of paradise have hepatoprotective effects through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (99893). Also, taking grains of paradise extract 30 mg daily for 4 weeks does not seem to adversely affect the liver in humans (99890).\nHypoglycemic effects\nAnimal research shows that grains of paradise seed extract, in doses of 450 mg/kg and 1500 mg/kg, but not 120 mg/kg, causes a significant decrease in blood glucose levels in rats (17207).\nStimulant effects\nThe seeds of grains of paradise are said to have stimulant effects (18).\nWeight loss effects\nGrains of paradise seed extracts are thought to have the potential to reduce body weight, improve body fat content, and increase energy expenditure through activation of the sympathetic nervous system, brown adipose tissue, and vanilloid receptor 1. These effects are purportedly due to the vanilloid moiety found on the structures of 6-paradol, 6-gingerol, and 6-shogaol, the major constituents found in grains of paradise seeds (99890, 99892). However, some animal research suggests that grains of paradise seed extract and the constituent 6-gingerol decrease sympathetic nerve activity in brown adipose tissue (99893).\n\nA small clinical study in healthy non-obese females shows that taking grains of paradise seed extract 10 mg with each meal daily for 4 weeks does not decrease body weight, body mass index, or body fat percentage when compared with placebo. However, it might increase energy expenditure and reduce abdominal fat (99890). Another small clinical study in healthy non-obese males shows that taking a single dose of grains of paradise seed extract 40 mg appears to increase energy expenditure in those with high brown adipose tissue activity (99892). A follow-up study in healthy non-obese males with low brown adipose tissue activity shows that taking grains of paradise seed extract 40 mg daily for 5 weeks appears to have no effect on energy expenditure at thermoneutral conditions, but increases cold-induced thermogenesis and decreases body fat percentage, when compared with placebo (105744). Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of grains of paradise in overweight or obese adults."

Cases of contact dermatitis have been reported in grape workers, including those working in California vineyards (53270, 53272, 53275).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, abdominal pain and nausea have been reported with use of grape seed extract, but these effects typically occur at rates similar to placebo (9182, 13162). In a case report of a 57-year-old man, intermittent nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred over a 10-day period and improved once grape seed extract was stopped (96764). Gastrointestinal adverse effects have also been reported with use of a different grape seed extract (Entelon, Hanlim Pharm). However, the specific types of gastrointestinal effects were not described (100954). A specific grape leaf extract AS195 (Antistax, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG) has reportedly caused flatulence, mild constipation, gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dry mouth, and retching (2538, 52985, 53206). Diarrhea, gastrointestinal distress, indigestion, and aversion to taste have been reported with use of Concord grape juice (52972, 53166, 53175, 53181, 53199). Loose stools have been reported in a clinical trial of grape pomace (99270). Bowel obstruction caused by intact grapes and grape seeds has been described in case reports (53241, 53284, 53278). Excessive consumption of grapes, dried grapes, raisins, or sultanas might cause diarrhea due to laxative effects (4201).\nless\nHematologic\nOrally, one case of leg hematoma following a minor trauma was reported in a person using grape leaf extract (2538).

One case report describes a 16-year-old female who developed increased levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) following skin-prick exposure to grape vine pollen, as well as positive test responses following bronchial and conjunctival provocation (53301). Reduced forced vital capacity has been described in California grape workers (53080, 53081). Occupational eosinophilic lung was diagnosed in a grape grower with a history of asthma. Respiratory exposure to sulfites in grape was implicated as the cause of the adverse reaction (53285).\nless\nOther\nOrally, grape products can cause adverse effects due to contamination with pesticides or mycotoxins. Some evidence has shown that pesticides used in vineyards may remain on grape surfaces post-harvesting. For example, the fungicide folpet sprayed on grapevines has been shown to remain on the grape surface. Although there was minimal penetration of the epicuticular wax, it showed high resistance to washing (52935). Carbaryl has been identified in over 58% of juice samples collected in Canada. This pesticide reportedly occurred more frequently in grape than in other juices. However, estimates of short-term intake were below proposed acute reference doses (53003).\n\nOchratoxin A is a mycotoxin that is suspected to be nephrotoxic, teratogenic, hepatotoxic and carcinogenic and has been identified in grape juice, frozen grape pulps, and red and white wine sold in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. However, the highest levels identified in grape products were lower than the established virtually safe dose of 5 ng/kg of body weight daily (53010, 53004). Ochratoxin A has also been identified in red, but not white, grape juice marketed in Switzerland, Canada, and the U.S. (53292, 53020).\nless",

It is unknown if other grape products are beneficial for CVI.\nSome clinical trials in patients with CVI show that taking a specific grape leaf extract, known as red vine leaf extract (AS 195, Antistax, Boehringer Ingelheim), seems to improve leg edema after 6 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo. Doses of 360 mg and 720 mg daily were both effective, but the higher dose produced a slightly greater effect. Patients also reported decreases in subjective complaints such as tired or heavy legs, tension, and tingling and pain after 2-12 weeks of treatment (2538, 52985, 53005, 53206).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral grape seed extract does not seem to improve hay fever symptoms.\nA clinical study in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis shows that taking grape seed extract 100 mg twice daily for 8 weeks before ragweed pollen season does not seem to decrease seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms or antihistamine usage when compared with placebo (9182).\nless\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).

Oral grape products do not seem to improve weight loss.\nClinical research in overweight or obese individuals shows that drinking Concord grape juice 480 mL daily for 12 weeks does not improve weight or body composition when compared to baseline (53181). Furthermore, taking grape pomace alone or in combination with schisandra fruit extract daily for 4-10 weeks does not improve body composition, abdominal fat, or body weight when compared with control (96200, 99269, 99270). Taking grape pomace 7-8 grams daily for 4-6 weeks seems to improve insulin resistance by about 33%, but does not affect blood lipids or blood pressure, when compared with placebo in overweight or obese adults with at least one metabolic syndrome factor (99269, 99270).\nless\nLower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Although there is interest in using oral grape seed for AMD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grape for this condition.\nAging skin. Oral grape skin extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small study in adults with signs of aging skin shows that taking a specific combination product (Celergen, Laboratories-Dom) containing grape skin extract 10 mg, marine collagen peptides 570 mg, coenzyme Q10 10 mg, luteolin 10 mg, and selenium 0.05 mg, one capsule with breakfast and dinner for 2 months, might improve skin elasticity when compared with baseline. However, there was no effect on moisture or biological skin age (97930). It is not clear if these effects are due to grape skin extract, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAtherosclerosis. Oral grape seed extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults shows that taking a specific combination product (Karinat, INAT-Farma) containing grape seed extract constituent proanthocyanidin 40 mg, garlic 100 mg, hops 160 mg, green tea 115 mg, vitamin C 30 mg, silicon 8 mg, vitamin E 6.6 mg, and beta-carotene 0.5 mg three capsules daily for 12 months might slow the progression of atherosclerosis as measured by mean carotid intima thickness when compared with placebo. However, the combination product does not seem to affect the growth of existing plaques, and it does not seem to improve lipid parameters (97929). It is not clear if these effects are due to grape seed extract, the other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nAthletic performance. It is unclear if oral grape products are beneficial for athletic performance.\nA small study in elite athletes shows that taking a specific grape extract (Powergrape, Naturex SA) 400 mg daily for one month can increase total power in a jumping task when compared with placebo, but has no effect on initial power and maintenance of power (53310). Another small study in recreationally active young adults shows that drinking juice prepared from 46 grams of a freeze-dried preparation of whole grapes daily for 6 weeks prior to a running exercise test does not improve maximal oxygen uptake or work capacity during exercise when compared with placebo (91540).\nless\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). Topical grape products have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with atopic dermatitis shows that twice daily application with a cream containing grape polyphenols, vitamin E, and epigallocatechin gallate for 28 days does not improve symptoms or reduce the affected area based on physician assessment when compared with placebo (96196).\nless\nAttention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there is interest in using oral grape seed for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grape for this condition.\nCanker sores. Although there is interest in using oral grape seed for canker sores, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grape for this condition.\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral grape products are beneficial for reducing CVD risk.\nThere is preliminary evidence that taking grape products, such as purple grape juice or red grape juice concentrate, might improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation, prevent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, reduce markers of inflammation, and suppress platelet-mediated thrombosis. Theoretically, chronic ingestion of these products might reduce the risk of CVD in various patient populations, including adults with type 2 diabetes or hypercholesterolemia, those undergoing hemodialysis, and children with metabolic syndrome (8745, 8746, 52954, 53030, 53062, 53106, 53155, 53174). However, a large meta-analysis shows that although taking grape products, including grape extract, grape juice, raisins, and grape seed extract, reduces levels of blood fats by a small amount in a mixed population of adults, these effects were not present in a subgroup of patients with CVD when compared with placebo. There was a small benefit on total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (102610).\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral grape products improve cognitive function.\nClinical research in healthy adults aged 55-75 years with no cognitive decline shows that taking a specific grape fruit extract (Cognigrape, Bionap srl) 250 mg daily for 12 weeks improves cognitive functioning by 4.5%, and overall neuropsychological status, including attention, language, and recall, by 6%, compared with no change in the placebo group (96198). Also, a preliminary clinical study in middle-aged women under moderate stress shows that drinking Concord grape juice 355 mL daily for 12 weeks improves immediate spacial memory and may improve executive function and verbal recall when compared with placebo (96195).\nless\nCognitive impairment. Small clinical studies suggest that oral grape products may not slow cognitive decline in older patients with cognitive impairment.\nOne very small study in in patients with mild cognitive decline shows that taking a freeze-dried grape powder 36 grams twice daily for 6 months does not improve most measures of cognitive function and memory, including immediate memory, delayed memory, speed of information processing, cognitive ability, or language, when compared with placebo (96199). Another very small study in older adults with signs of memory decline shows that drinking 100% Concord grape juice 6-9 mL/kg daily for 12 weeks does not improve delayed verbal recall or spatial memory when compared with placebo, although it does seem to moderately improve verbal learning (53166).\nless\nColorectal cancer. Oral grape seed extract is has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research in patients with colorectal cancer shows that taking a product containing grape seed extract, turmeric extract, fermented soybean extract, green tea extract, spirulina, and Taiwanofungus camphoratus, 1920 mg three times daily for 16 weeks during a chemotherapy regimen might modestly increase the effectiveness of treatment when compared with placebo. No patients in the treatment group experienced disease progression, compared with 15.8% (6 patients) of the placebo group. However, there was no significant effect on overall survival or the best response to treatment (96183).\nless\nConstipation. Although there is interest in using oral grape products for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grape for this condition.\nDental caries. Although there is interest in using topical grape seed for dental caries, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grape for this purpose.\nDiabetes. Oral grape extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large clinical study of males with type 2 diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction suggests that an oral combination product containing alpha lipoic acid, Gingko biloba, and grape extract (Blunorm Forte, Uriach S.p.A.) taken for 3 months may decrease fasting plasma glucose and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) score both alone and when combined with avanafil when compared with baseline and placebo (110707).\nless\nDiabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral grape seed extract is beneficial in patients with diabetic retinopathy.\nA preliminary clinical study in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy shows that taking a specific grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (Entelon, Hanlim Pharm) 50 mg three times daily for 12 months reduces the severity of hard exudates when compared with calcium dobesilate or placebo. Grape seed extract had a treatment success rate 3-fold and 5.5-fold higher than those of calcium dobesilate and placebo, respectively. Treatment success was defined as a 2-grade decrease in hard exudate severity. No significant improvements in retinopathy grade or visual acuity were reported (100954). However, the study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes.\nless\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Oral grape extract has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA large study of males with type 2 diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction suggests that a specific combination product containing alpha lipoic acid, grape extract, and gingko biloba (Blunorm Forte, Uriach S.p.A.) administered orally for three months with avanafil prior to sexual acts improves International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scores when compared with either product alone, placebo, and baseline, and may reduce markers of ED including high sensitivity-c-reactive protein, nitrates/nitrites, and metalloproteinases-2 and -9. These results suggest that an oral combination nutraceutical consisting of alpha lipoic acid, grape extract, and gingko biloba (Blunorm Forte, Uriach S.p.A.) may react synergistically with avanafil to enhance sexual performance in males with type 2 diabetes and erectile dysfunction. It is unclear if this effect is due to the alpha lipoic acid, grape extract, or gingko biloba, but researchers theorize that it may be due to the inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 enzymes by grape extract (110707).\nless\nHemorrhoids. Although there is interest in using oral grape seed for hemorrhoids, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grape for this purpose.\nHypercholesterolemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral grape products reduce cholesterol levels by a small amount.\nA large meta-analysis of heterogeneous clinical trials shows that taking grape products, including grape extract, grape juice, raisins, or grape seed extract, for 2-54 weeks reduces levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, by a small amount when compared with placebo in a mixed population of adults. In a sub-group of patients with any hyperlipidemia, the mean decreases in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were 11 mg/dL and 14 mg/dL, respectively. There was no effect on levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the mixed population or in adults with hyperlipidemia (102610). Although some individual studies disagree, the most evidence for benefit is related to use of whole grape extract or grape seed extract. It is not clear if benefit is dependent on dose or duration of use. These results suggest a benefit of grape products in patients with hypercholesterolemia, but any benefit is likely to be small (42585, 96816, 102610).\nless\nHypertension. Some research suggests that oral grape products may modestly lower blood pressure; however, results are inconsistent.\nSome clinical trials have shown modest benefit in patients with prehypertension, mild hypertension, or metabolic syndrome (18228, 53149, 96197), but conflicting results exists (91541, 90079). A 2016 meta-analysis including 16 trials of 810 patients shows that when compared with placebo, grape seed extract or polyphenols reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by about 6 mmHg and 3 mmHg, respectively, with greatest improvements observed in those with obesity or metabolic syndrome. This meta-analysis suggests that a minimum treatment duration of 8 weeks may be necessary before benefit is seen (96194). However, other research in adults with hypertension shows that taking grape seed polyphenols 1000 mg daily for 6 weeks does not alter blood pressure. Also, when grape seed polyphenols were combined with vitamin C 500 mg daily, some patients experienced an increase in blood pressure and worsening of nighttime and daytime variation in blood pressure (13162, 90079).\n\nThe reason for these conflicting findings is unclear but may due to patient characteristics and comorbidities. A meta-analysis of clinical research in various patient populations shows that taking grape seed extract 150-2100 mg for 2-25 weeks improves DBP and heart rate when compared with control, but does not improve SBP or flow-mediated dilation, regardless of dose, duration, sex, BMI, or health status. Additionally, subgroup analyses suggest that blood pressure effects may be greater in patients who are otherwise healthy, female, overweight, and/or under 50 years of age. Also, the use of lower doses and longer treatment durations may be associated with greater benefit (108090). The validity of these findings is limited by the high heterogeneity of included studies. A clinical study in adults with mildly elevated blood pressure shows that a specific grape seed extract (Enovita; Indena SpA) standardized to provide at least 95% oligomeric proanthocyanins, taken as 150 mg twice daily for 16 weeks, does not reduce SBP or DBP when compared with placebo. However, a subgroup analysis suggests that taking grape seed extract improves blood pressure in males, but not in females, when compared with placebo (108091).\n\nSome research has also evaluated the effects of grape juice on blood pressure. Two clinical studies in patients with hypertension show that drinking grape juice can reduce blood pressure when compared to baseline; however, another study shows that drinking grape juice does not reduce blood pressure when compared with placebo in these patients (53018, 53156, 53199).\nless\nMelasma. It is unclear if oral grape seed extract is beneficial in patients with melasma.\nA very small clinical study in Japanese females with melasma shows that taking grape seed extract (Gravinol, Kikkoman Co) containing 54 mg of proanthocyanidins three times daily for 6-11 months reduces skin hyperpigmentation when compared to pretreatment (53016). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nMenopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral grape seed extract is beneficial in patients with menopausal symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research in adults with at least one menopausal symptom shows that taking grape seed extract (Gravinol, Kikkoman Biochemifa Co) containing proanthocyanidin 200 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces anxiety when compared with placebo. It also reduces hot flashes and other physical symptoms when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo. A lower dose of proanthocyanidin 100 mg daily does not appear to improve these outcomes. Neither doses improved insomnia or depression (91542).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Small studies suggest that various oral grape products might improve lipid levels and blood pressure in patients with metabolic syndrome.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome shows that taking grape products, usually grape seed or grape extract, for 4-48 weeks reduces levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, by a small amount when compared with placebo. The mean decreases in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were 2.6 mg/dL and 11 mg/dL, respectively (102610). These findings are limited by significant heterogeneity of the included research. Also, a small clinical study in overweight or obese adults, most with metabolic syndrome, shows that taking grape pomace 8 grams daily for 6 weeks improves insulin resistance by about 33%, but does not affect blood lipids, blood pressure, or fasting glucose, when compared with placebo (99270).\n\nSome grape products have also shown benefit for improving blood pressure in patients with metabolic syndrome. One small clinical crossover study in males with metabolic syndrome shows that taking 46 grams daily of a freeze-dried, dehydrated preparation of grape polyphenols (equivalent to about 250 grams of fresh grapes daily) for 30 days seems to modestly lower systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure, and increase brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) when compared with placebo (18228). Also, a small clinical study in adolescents with metabolic syndrome suggests that drinking natural grape juice 18 mL/kg daily for one month improves FMD when compared with baseline (53174).The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. A very small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific grape seed extract (Meganatural BP, Polyphenolics) 150-300 mg daily for 4 weeks modestly reduces blood pressure when compared with placebo (53149). The validity of this finding is limited due to small study size and because patients in the treatment groups had higher blood pressure at baseline.\nless\nMinor bleeding. Topical grape vine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that topically applying 4 mL of a specific product (Ankaferd blood stopper) containing grape vine, alpinia, licorice, thyme, and stinging nettle reduces bleeding, but does not improve the surgical time for episiotomy repair, when compared with saline (31010). It is unclear if this effect is due to grape vine, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMuscle soreness. It is unclear if oral grape products improve muscle soreness.\nOne small study in active young adults shows that drinking juice, prepared from 46 grams of freeze-dried whole grapes, daily for 6 weeks prior to an eccentric arm exercise test does not reduce muscle inflammation or pain at 24 or 48 hours post-exercise when compared with placebo (91540).\nless\nNight vision. Although there is interest in using oral grape seed extract for improving night vision, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grape for purpose.\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral grape seed extract reverses fatty liver in patients with NAFLD.\nOne small clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking grape seed extract 1000 mg twice daily for 3 months improves some, but not all, markers of liver damage and improves the grade of fatty liver change when compared with vitamin C supplementation (53190).\nless\nOcular stress. Although there is interest in using oral grape seed extract for ocular stress, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grape for this purpose.\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS). Although there is interest in using oral grape seed extract for PMS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grape for this condition.\nWound healing. Limited research suggests that topical grape seed extract might improve wound healing.\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing surgical removal of minor skin lesions shows that applying red grape seed extract 2% cream twice daily to the affected areas reduces the time to complete wound healing by about 6 days when compared with a placebo cream (91539). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients recovering from cesarean section shows that applying grape seed extract 5% ointment twice daily to cesarean section wounds for 14 days improves wound healing, as measured by a scoring system assessing redness, edema, ecchymosis, discharge, and wound closure, when compared with a placebo ointment. A 2.5% ointment did not improve wound healing measures when compared with placebo (100955).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate grape for these uses.",

            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation or treatment of overdose with grape products.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn humans, the aglycone forms of resveratrol and quercetin in grape juice appear to be absorbed more readily than the glycoside derivatives (15145). Proanthocyanidins and flavonoids from grape seed extract and grape juice are absorbed and distributed into serum within two to three hours of ingestion (52956, 52988, 53073). Oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) are poorly absorbed in the human small intestine (53007, 53077). When applied topically, (-)-epicatechin, a constituent of grape seed extract (GSE), penetrates the skin and is retained in the upper part of the skin for approximately 1% and 3% of the dose in formulations containing butylated hydroxytoluene and alpha-tocopherol, respectively (53069).\nDistribution\nProanthocyanidins and flavonoids from grape seed extract and grape juice can be detected in serum within two to three hours of ingestion (52956, 52988, 53073).\nMetabolism\nPolyphenols from grape juice are metabolized to phenolic acids by colonic microbiota (53165, 53197). The most common phenolic acids produced include syringic acid, 3- and 4-hydroxyhippuric acid, 4-hydroxymandelic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (53165, 53251).\nExcretion\nAnthocyanins and phenolic acids formed from polyphenols in grape juice extract are excreted in the urine (52984, 53165, 53251).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of grape are the fruit, fruit skin, seed, and leaf. Grape products contain phenolic compounds including oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs), proanthocyanidins, flavonols, and polyflavan-3-ols. Proanthocyanidins are responsible for producing the red color of grapes (3579). Specific flavonoids in grape products include quercetin, catechin, myricetin, and kaempferol. The red vine grape extract AS 195 (Antistax, Boehringer Ingelheim) used in one clinical trial primarily contains the flavonoids quercetin-3-O-beta-glucuronide and isoquercetin (2538). Red wine contains approximately 10 times the amount of flavonoids of white wine (8745).\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory effects\nIn vitro evidence shows that proanthocyanidins and oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) from grape can inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme activity (53273, 53321). Moreover, OPCs appear to blunt hypertension induced by intravenous infusion of angiotensin I and angiotensin II in a rabbit model (53273).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGrape leaf is reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. These properties appear to be greatest in the red leaves (4201). In various animal models and in a human study, grape seed extract and grape powder have been shown to attenuate inflammation and/or reduce proinflammatory cytokines (53140, 53230, 53237, 53267, 96200).\n\nThe mechanism(s) of action underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of grape constituents reportedly include free radical scavenging, interference with abnormal cell proliferation, and/or reducing cytokine activity and cyclooxygenase-2 (52946, 52982, 53171). Resveratrol, a constituent of grapes, has been shown to interfere with the function of chemoattractant receptors on phagocytic leukocytes in vitro, resulting in anti-inflammatory effects (53033).\nAntiallergic effects\nPreliminary research suggests that grape catechins might inhibit allergen-induced histamine release from mast cells (9182).\nAntiarthritic effects\nAnimal research shows that grape seed extract can improve the symptoms of collagen-induced arthritis. In vitro research indicates that this antiarthritic effect may be due to suppression of interleukin (IL)-17 production and enhancement of Foxp3 expression in splenocytes and CD4+ T cells in joints (53201).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro evidence shows that seed, skin, and whole grape extract can inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus (52930, 53302).\nAnticancer effects\nGrape seed extract and grape seed proanthocyanidins seem to decrease the proliferation of gastric adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, leukemia, and glioblastoma cells by inhibiting cell growth and increasing cell death (10224, 10157, 50780, 52942, 52970, 52978, 52980, 52990, 53009, 53043)(53050, 53056, 53071, 53076, 53095, 53134, 53141, 53193) (96183). One way that grape seed extract appears to inhibit the growth of cancer is by preventing angiogenesis by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (53040, 53131). Grape seed proanthocyanidins and grape polyphenols seem to prevent metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer cells (53050, 53112, 53139). Piceatannol, a polyphenol constituent of grape, appears to decrease the proliferation of bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma cells by increasing cell death (53006, 53103, 53160, 53185). However, preliminary evidence suggests that the proanthocyanidins delphinidin and delphinidin/cyanidin dimer might induce chromosomal damage (4074).\nAntifungal effects\nSome in vitro research suggests that grape extract, applied at concentrations of 1% to 10%, inhibits the growth of Aspergillus niger (53303).\nAntilipemic effects\nSome clinical research shows that grape extracts reduce levels of triacylglycerol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in healthy adults and those with elevated levels at baseline (102610). In animals fed a high-cholesterol diet, intake of polymeric grape seed tannins appears to attenuate increases in plasma total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, LDL cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol concentrations, as well as attenuate decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (53331). In vitro evidence suggests that constituents of grape bark can inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (53100), while grape seed extract appears to inhibit cholesterol uptake in colorectal, hepatic, and duodenal cells (53126). Other in vitro evidence shows that red grape juice polyphenols can alter cholesterol homeostasis and increase LDL-receptor activity in human liver cells and blood cells (53060). The authors suggested that the polyphenols may disrupt or delay trafficking of LDL through the endocytic pathway and therefore prevent its effects on intracellular lipid homeostasis.\nAntioxidant effects\nFree radical-scavenging activity of grape seed extract and grape fruit extract appear to be similar (53326). However, red grape varieties provide more antioxidant protection than white or blush grape varieties (3579). Also, fresh grapes appear to have higher antioxidant activity than grape jam and raisins (53255). A significant correlation appears to exist between total phenol content, proanthocyanidin content, and the antioxidant activity of grape products (3579, 8745, 53326). A specific grape seed extract (Leucoselect) containing an equivalent of 300 mg of grape seed proanthocyanidins seems to increase serum total antioxidant activity in healthy people (10156). Another grape seed extract (Leucoselect-Phytosome) containing 75 mg of grape proanthocyanidins seems to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) susceptibility to oxidation in heavy smokers (52992). Similarly, a grape extract (Biovin, Cyvex Nutrition Inc) 375 mg containing about 40% polyphenols appears to increase serum antioxidant potential and lower protein and LDL oxidation in healthy people (53138). Grape pomace, containing polyphenols and tocopherols, increases serum antioxidant potential and lowers LDL oxidation in overweight or obese men (99269). Preliminary evidence also suggests grape seed proanthocyanidins may provide greater protection against reactive oxygen species, free radical-induced lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage than the combination of vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta-carotene or a combination of vitamin E and vitamin C (10157). Grape flavonoids such as quercetin also have antioxidant activity. Grape flavonoids appear to decrease superoxide production, increase nitric oxide release from platelets, modestly increase the levels of antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol, and decrease platelet protein-kinase C (PKC) activity (8745).\nAntivenom effects\nIn human plasma ex vivo, the methanol extract of grape seed seems to inhibit the procoagulation properties of venom from the saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus) (53110). Also, animal research shows that application of grape seed extract to the bite wound caused by a Russell's viper (Vipera russelli) or saw-scaled viper ameliorates local effects of the venom. Grape seed extract seems to neutralize proteolytic and hyaluronidase activities, hemorrhage and edema-inducing activities, and also partially inhibits procoagulant activity and prevents the degradation of fibrinogen chains (53110, 53146).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro research shows that grape or grape constituents can inhibit the replication of the recombinant adenovirus vector Ad-5 and the secretion of HbsAg, HbeAg, and HBV DNA, as well as reduce the infectivity of the human enteric virus surrogates bacteriophage MS2, feline calicivirus (FCV-F9), hepatitis A virus strain HM175, and murine norovirus (MNV-1) (53202, 53224, 53172).\nBone effects\nIn vitro research shows that syringetin, a constituent of grape, can induce human osteoblast differentiation through the bone morphogenetic protein-2/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway (53158).\nCardiovascular effects\nGrape polyphenols, particularly flavonoids, have a wide variety of effects including antioxidant, vasodilating, anti-lipoperoxidant activity, and antiplatelet properties that might prevent heart disease (8476, 8745, 10156, 52931, 52974, 53102, 53031, 53036, 53087, 53170, 99269). Grape catechins can inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, while grape tannins have endothelium-dependent vasodilating activity. Intake of the grape flavonoids myricetin, kaempferol, and quercetin has been associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (8746). Some evidence suggests that proanthocyanidins from grape seeds can decrease reperfusion injury after cardiac ischemia by removing free radicals. This might also decrease the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias that sometimes occurs in cardiac reperfusion injury (10223).\n\nIn vitro research suggests that grape seed extract may improve vascular inflammation by reducing cell adhesion molecules such as endothelin-1 and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (108091). Additionally, there is speculation that whole grape extracts might improve vascular function in patients with metabolic syndrome. Males with this syndrome who consumed 46 grams/day of a powder prepared from dehydrated red, green and black seeded and unseeded grapes for 30 days had decreased blood pressure, increased brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation, and lowered levels of ICAM-1 (18228). Research suggests that proanthocyanidin-rich grape seed extract can reduce the development of aortic atherosclerosis caused by a diet high in cholesterol, possibly by preventing LDL oxidation (53300). Although some preliminary clinical evidence shows that consuming grape juice does not have additional antithrombotic activity in patients with cardiovascular disease who are taking aspirin, it does appear to suppress platelet-dependent inflammatory indices in these patients (53012).\nDental effects\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are produced in response to pathogens and play a role in the tissue destruction that accompanies periodontal disease. In macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), grape seed extract seems to inhibit the secretion and/or activity of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (53162). Other in vitro evidence shows that treatment of teeth with 5% proanthocyanidin solution after bleaching can improve the bond strength of bleached enamel compared to treatment with sodium ascorbate after bleaching (53239). Also, application of adhesive containing 5% grape seed proanthocyanidins to acid-etched dentin appears to protected collagen fibrils in the hybrid layer from collagenase digestion (53196). Some preliminary research suggests that grape seed extract may decrease demineralization and increase remineralization of root caries (53116, 53245, 53249, 53258, 53266).\nDermatologic effects\nOligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) are thought to inhibit the proteolytic enzymes collagenase, elastase, hyaluronidase, and beta glucuronidase, which are involved in the breakdown of structural components of the vasculature and skin (3900). OPCs are also thought to protect melanocytes from ultraviolet-induced melanogenesis by scavenging intracellular reactive oxidative species, altering the cell cycle, and decreasing levels of enzymes involved in melanin synthesis (53041, 53053, 53078, 53132). Also, grape seed proanthocyanidins seem to inhibit UV-radiation-induced oxidative stress in human skin cells (53053, 53219).\nDrug metabolizing effects\nGrape seed proanthocyanidins seem to inhibit the cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) enzyme, which might protect normal cells against drug and chemical-induced toxicity (10157). Proanthocyanidins might also protect against tobacco-induced and chemotherapy drug-induced damage to normal cells, and minimize liver and kidney damage after overdosage of acetaminophen (10157).\nGastrointestinal effects\nGrape fruit are reported to have laxative and expectorant properties (4201). Also, preliminary research in humans shows that grape seed extract (GSE) may decrease abdominal pain associated with chronic pancreatitis (52950).\nHepatic effects\nHepatoprotective effects of grape pomace extracts observed in animals have been attributed to its antioxidant effects, including decreased lipid peroxidation and restored antioxidant enzyme levels (52966).\nHormonal effects\nAlthough some preliminary evidence from animal studies suggests that grapes may inhibit the enzyme aromatase, decreasing the synthesis of estrogen, hormonal changes were not observed in postmenopausal women taking grape seed extract (96184).\nImmunostimulant effects\nIn vitro research shows that grape seed extract induces the production of Th1-derived interferon (IFN)-gamma (52960). Theoretically, this immunostimulant effect may contribute to the antiviral and anticancer effects of grape seed extract.\nNeurologic effects\nIn a mouse model of Alzheimer disease, grape seed extract has been shown to prevent deposition of beta-amyloid and attenuate brain inflammation (53143). Some in vitro research shows that proanthocyanidins from grape seeds can inhibit the function of 5-hydroxytryptamin (5-HT)(3) receptors in neuroblastoma cells via noncompetitive inhibition. Theoretically, grape seed proanthocyanidins may be useful as therapeutic agents for alleviating symptoms such as vomiting or pain (53233).\nPhotoprotective effects\nAnimal research shows that grape seed proanthocyanidins may inhibit UVB-induced oxidative stress and reduce the incidence, multiplicity, and number of malignant transformation of UV-induced skin cancer (53078, 53105). Also, in vitro research shows that grape seed proanthocyanidins have photoprotective effects in UV-irradiated normal human melanocytes (53132, 53219, 53243).\nWound-healing effects\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying grape seed extract, which contains proanthocyanidins, can reduce the time for complete wound healing (91539). Animal and in vitro research shows that grape seed proanthocyanidin extract may increase wound healing by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tenascin expression (52951, 52968). However, other in vitro research shows that grape seed proanthocyanidin extract can inhibit fibrinolysis and cell migration towards the wounded region. These two steps are necessary for early phases of wound healing (53151)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "The grapefruit is a member of the citrus family. Common grapefruits are white or pinky red in color. The color variance is due to the presence (pinky red) or absence (white) of lycopene (94143). Drug interactions with grapefruit juice are well documented (3775).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Grapefruit has Generally Recognized as Safe status (GRAS) in the US (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately for medicinal purposes. A grapefruit seed extract has been safely used in clinical research (5866). In addition, capsules containing grapefruit pectin 15 grams daily have been used in clinical research for up to 16 weeks (2216).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in excessive amounts. Preliminary population research shows that consuming a quarter or more of a whole grapefruit daily is associated with a 25% to 30% increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (14858). Grapefruit juice is thought to reduce estrogen metabolism resulting in increased endogenous estrogen levels. More evidence is needed to validate this finding.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of using medicinal amounts of grapefruit during pregnancy and lactation; avoid using.",

When large quantities are consumed, arrhythmias, mineralocorticoid excess, QT prolongation, and pseudohyperaldosteronism have been reported. There is also some concern for increased breast cancer risk with grapefruit consumption.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, consumption of pink grapefruit juice 1000 mL can cause QT prolongation and cause arrhythmias in healthy patients and worsen arrhythmias in cardiomyopathy patients (13031, 91424).\nless\nEndocrine\nOrally, high doses of grapefruit juice have been observed to cause pseudohyperaldosteronism and mineralocorticoid excess (53340, 53346).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nIn a case report, grapefruit juice held against the teeth resulted in enamel and tooth surface loss (53368).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, grapefruit can cause allergic sensitization characterized by eosinophilic gastroenteritis, urticaria, and generalized pruritus (53351, 53360).\nless\nOncologic\nPreliminary population research shows that postmenopausal adults who consume a quarter or more of a whole grapefruit daily have a 25% to 30% increased risk of developing breast cancer (14858). Grapefruit is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, which metabolizes estrogen. Consuming large amounts of grapefruit might significantly increase endogenous estrogen levels and therefore increase the risk of breast cancer. More evidence is needed to validate these findings.

Although there has been interest in using topical grapefruit oil for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grapefruit for this purpose.\nAsthma. It is unclear if oral grapefruit is beneficial in patients with asthma.\nThere is some evidence that consumption of vitamin C-rich citrus fruits, including grapefruit and others, might improve lung function in people with asthma. Intake of citrus fruits 1-2 times weekly has produced this benefit in some studies (6049, 6055, 6056). However, other studies have shown no benefit (6057, 6058).\nless\nAtherosclerosis. Although there has been interest in using oral grapefruit to treat or prevent atherosclerosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grapefruit for this purpose.\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral grapefruit seed extract is beneficial in patients with atopic dermatitis.\nOne small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with atopic dermatitis shows that taking a specific grapefruit seed extract product (ParaMicrocidin, Allergy Research Group) 150 mg three times daily for one month can decrease complaints of constipation, flatulence, and abdominal discomfort, possibly due to changes in intestinal microflora (5866). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nDepression. Although there has been interest in using inhaled grapefruit oil as aromatherapy for depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grapefruit oil for this purpose.\nGingivitis.

Although there has been interest in using inhaled grapefruit oil as aromatherapy for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grapefruit oil for this purpose.\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral grapefruit is beneficial in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nOne small clinical study in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking capsules containing grapefruit pectin 5 grams three times daily for 16 weeks decreases total cholesterol by 8% and the ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 10% when compared to baseline (2216). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nHypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral grapefruit is beneficial in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.\nOne small clinical study in patients with hypertriglyceridemia that is not well controlled on statin therapy shows that consuming one red or white grapefruit daily for 30 days reduces total cholesterol by 8% to 15.5% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 11% to 20% when compared with placebo. In addition, consuming one red, but not one white, grapefruit daily reduces triglyceride levels by 17% when compared with placebo in these patients (53352).\nless\nIntestinal parasite infection. Although there has been interest in using oral grapefruit seed extract for intestinal parasite infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grapefruit for this purpose.\nLice. It is unclear if topical grapefruit extract is beneficial in children with head lice.\nOne small clinical study in children aged 2-9 years with head lice shows that applying 50 mL of a specific shampoo containing grapefruit extract (Licatack shampoo) to the hair for 10-20 minutes and then rinsing with water and combing can eliminate adult lice. Applying a second application after 10 days seems to help remove any remaining nits (91417). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group.\nless\nObesity. While some small studies suggest that oral grapefruit extract, taken in combination with other citrus extracts, may modestly improve weight loss, the effect of oral grapefruit alone is unclear.\nOne small clinical study in obese adults shows that consuming one and a half fresh grapefruits daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight by 1.3 kg when compared with placebo. Also, although drinking 8 ounces of grapefruit juice or taking grapefruit capsules three times daily for 12 weeks did not improve body weight when compared with placebo in the overall study population, a sub-group analysis of obese adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking grapefruit capsules or drinking grapefruit juice increases weight loss and improves insulin resistance when compared with placebo (53353).\n\nGrapefruit has also been evaluated in combination with other citrus ingredients. Two clinical studies shows that taking a specific combination product (Sinetrol, Fytexia) containing sweet orange, blood orange, and grapefruit extracts for 12 weeks can decrease body weight, body fat percentage, and body mass index (BMI) in otherwise healthy overweight adults (95517, 95518). In one study, taking this supplement as 450 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduced body weight by 1 kg and body fat percentage by 6.5% when compared with placebo. Hip circumference, waist circumference, and blood glucose were also reduced when compared with placebo (95518). In another study, taking this same supplement as 700 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduced body weight by 5.6 kg, body fat percentage by 5%, and BMI by 2% when compared to baseline. Patients taking placebo experienced no significant improvements from baseline (95517). It is not clear if these effects are due to grapefruit extract, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nPharyngitis.

Although there has been interest in using inhaled grapefruit oil as aromatherapy for stress, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grapefruit oil for this purpose.\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Although there has been interest in using grapefruit oil as aromatherapy for various upper respiratory tract infections, including influenza and the common cold, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grapefruit oil for these conditions.\nVaginal candidiasis. Although there has been interest in using oral and topical grapefruit seed extract for vaginal candidiasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of grapefruit seed extract for this purpose.\nMore evidence is needed to rate grapefruit for these uses",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nVarious formulations of grapefruit have been used, including whole fruit, fruit juice, pectin, freeze-dried whole grapefruit, and grapefruit extracts. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nUse caution when drinking grapefruit juice with tonic water or red wine. Grapefruit's inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes might interfere with the metabolism of quinine in tonic water. This combination should be avoided in people with cardiac rhythm disorders such as long QT syndrome that may worsen with quinine (10158). Additionally, drinking red wine in combination with grapefruit juice appears to have an additive inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, theoretically increasing the risk for interactions with other drugs. White wine does not appear to affect CYP3A4 (7778).\nChildren\nTopical:\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nGrapefruit seed extract is processed from grapefruit seeds and pulp obtained as a byproduct from grapefruit juice production. Vegetable glycerin is added to the final product to reduce acidity and bitterness.\n\nThe chemistry of the grapefruit varies by the species, the growing conditions, the method and temperature of storage, and the process used to extract the juice. White grapefruits contain no lycopene and higher levels of furanocoumarins; red grapefruits contain lycopene and lower levels of furanocoumarins (95973). Since grapefruit juice is not standardized, use as an adjunct to drug therapy is not recommended (3775, 95973, 95977).",

The acebutolol half-life is also extended by 1.1 hours when grapefruit juice is consumed concomitantly (18101). Grapefruit juice is thought to affect OATP for only a short time. Therefore, separating drug administration and consumption of grapefruit by at least 4 hours is likely to prevent this interaction (17603, 17604).\nless\nALISKIREN (Tekturna, Rasilez)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nGrapefruit juice can decrease blood levels of aliskiren, potentially decreasing the clinical effects of aliskiren.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice can decrease aliskiren levels by approximately 60% by inhibiting organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) (91428). Grapefruit juice is thought to affect OATP for only a short time. Therefore, separating drug administration and consumption of grapefruit by at least 4 hours is likely to prevent this interaction (17603, 17604).\nless\nAMIODARONE (Cordarone)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of amiodarone, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of amiodarone.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice inhibits metabolism and increases absorption of amiodarone. Grapefruit juice increases amiodarone plasma levels by 50% and peak concentration by 84% (17601, 17672, 22120).\nless\nAMPRENAVIR (Agenerase)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nGrapefruit juice might decrease blood levels of amprenavir, although this is not likely to be clinically significant.\nSome clinical research shows that grapefruit juice can slightly decrease amprenavir levels (17673); however, this is probably not clinically significant.\nless\nARTEMETHER (Artenam, Paluther)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of oral artemether, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of artemether.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice increases the levels of oral artemether by 90% to 250% in healthy males (5065, 5066).\nless\nBENZODIAZEPINES\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice might increase blood levels of some oral benzodiazepines, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of these drugs.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice can increase plasma triazolam concentrations. Repeated consumption of grapefruit juice greatly increases triazolam concentrations and prolongs the half-life, probably due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (7776, 22118, 22131, 22133). Some studies show that grapefruit juice, particularly when taken in large quantities, reduces the clearance and increases the maximum blood levels, area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC), and duration of effect of midazolam. However, there is no effect on intravenous midazolam (4300, 10159, 11275, 17601, 22117, 22119, 16711, 91427, 95978). Grapefruit juice has also been shown to increase the maximum blood levels and duration of effect of diazepam, but the clinical significance of this is not known (3228). This interaction does not appear to occur with alprazolam (17674).\nless\nBLONANSERIN (Lonasen)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of blonanserin, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of blonanserin.\nBlonanserin is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). A small clinical study shows that taking grapefruit juice along with oral blonanserin increases exposure to blonanserin almost 6-fold due to inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 by grapefruit juice and prolongs the elimination half-life of blonanserin by 2.2-fold due to inhibition of hepatic CYP3A4 by grapefruit juice (96943).\nless\nBUDESONIDE (Entocort, UCERIS)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of budesonide, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of budesonide.\nBudesonide is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). A small clinical study shows that taking grapefruit juice along with oral budesonide increases the plasma concentration of budesonide. This effect is attributed to grapefruit-induced inhibition of CYP3A4 in both the colon and small intestine (91425).\nless\nBUSPIRONE (BuSpar)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of buspirone, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of buspirone.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice increases absorption and plasma concentrations of buspirone (3771).\nless\nCAFFEINE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nGrapefruit juice can decrease the clearance of caffeine, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of caffeine.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice decreases caffeine clearance (4300).\nless\nCALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of oral calcium channel blockers, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of these drugs.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice increases absorption and plasma concentrations of amlodipine (523), nifedipine (528, 22114), nisoldipine (529), verapamil (7779, 8285), felodipine, nimodipine, nicardipine, diltiazem, pranidipine, nitrendipine, and manidipine (524, 528, 1388, 4300, 7780, 11276, 22136, 53338, 22138, 22139) (22140, 22141, 22142, 22143, 22147, 22148, 22149, 53367, 22158),\n\nThis interaction is likely the result of the inhibition of intestinal metabolism of these drugs by CYP3A4 (7779, 7780), although some research suggests grapefruit may alter plasma drug levels by reducing the rate of gastric emptying (22167). Consuming grapefruit juice 1 liter daily increases steady state concentrations of verapamil by as much as 50% (8285). However, some references dispute the clinical relevance of the interactions with amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil (3230, 4300, 22159). Other research in healthy individuals suggests plasma levels of felodipine and nifedipine are not affected when given intravenously (22144, 22146). There is considerable interindividual variability in the effect of grapefruit juice on drug metabolism, which might account for inconsistent study results (7777, 7779, 8285). In healthy older adults, the hemodynamic response to felodipine plus grapefruit juice might be influenced by altered autonomic regulation. In older healthy adults, a single dose of grapefruit juice and felodipine enhanced the blood pressure-lowering effects of felodipine. However, after a week of grapefruit juice and felodipine (steady state), the hypotensive activity was reduced, possibly due to compensatory tachycardia (1392). Research indicates it is necessary to withhold grapefruit juice for as long as 3 days to avoid interactions with felodipine and nisoldipine (5068, 5069, 6453, 22145).\nless\nCARBAMAZEPINE (Tegretol)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of carbamazepine, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of carbamazepine.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice increases absorption and plasma concentrations of carbamazepine (524).\nless\nCARVEDILOL (Coreg)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of carvedilol, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of carvedilol.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice increases the bioavailability of a single dose of carvedilol by 16% (5071).\nless\nCELIPROLOL (Celicard)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can decrease blood levels of celiprolol, potentially decreasing the clinical effects of celiprolol.\nIn human research, taking grapefruit juice within two hours of celiprolol appears to decrease absorption and blood levels of celiprolol by approximately 85% (91421). This interaction is due to grapefruit-induced inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) (17603, 17604, 22161). Grapefruit juice is thought to affect OATP for only a short time. Therefore, separating drug administration and consumption of grapefruit by at least 4 hours is likely to prevent this interaction (17603, 17604).\nless\nCISAPRIDE (Propulsid)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of cisapride, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of cisapride.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice increases the absorption and plasma concentrations of cisapride. According to the cisapride prescribing information, grapefruit juice is contraindicated in patients taking cisapride (1383, 3226, 17601, 22164, 22165).\nless\nCLOMIPRAMINE (Anafranil)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, grapefruit juice might increase blood levels of clomipramine, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of clomipramine.\nCase reports have shown that clomipramine trough levels increase significantly after the addition of grapefruit juice to the therapeutic regimen (5064).\nless\nCLOPIDOGREL (Plavix)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can decrease blood levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel, thereby decreasing the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel.\nClopidogrel is an antiplatelet prodrug that is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to form the active metabolite. A small clinical study shows that taking grapefruit juice with clopidogrel decreases plasma levels of the active metabolite by more than 80% and impairs the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. This effect is possibly due to grapefruit-induced inhibition of CYP2C19 (91419).\nless\nCOLCHICINE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, grapefruit juice might increase blood levels of colchicine, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of colchicine.\nColchicine is an alkaloid that undergoes P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated drug efflux in the intestines, followed by metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). There is concern that grapefruit juice will increase the effects and adverse effects of colchicine due to grapefruit-induced inhibition of P-gp and/or CYP3A4. In vitro evidence shows that grapefruit juice increases absorption of colchicine by inhibiting P-gp (94158). A case of acute colchicine toxicity has been reported for an 8-year-old female who drank grapefruit juice while taking high-dose colchicine, long-term (94157). However, one small clinical study in healthy adults shows that drinking grapefruit juice 240 mL twice daily for 4 days does not affect the bioavailability or adverse effects of a single dose of colchicine 0.6 mg taken on the fourth day (35762).\nless\nCYCLOSPORINE (Neoral, Sandimmune)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of oral cyclosporine, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of cyclosporine.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice increases the absorption and plasma concentrations of cyclosporine (522, 11270, 22113, 22150, 22152, 22153, 22154, 22155). The mechanism of action is unclear. However, there is no effect on intravenous cyclosporine (22151).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, grapefruit juice might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2.\nIn vitro research suggests that grapefruit juice might inhibit CYP1A2 enzymes (12479). So far, this interaction has not been reported in humans.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, grapefruit juice might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.\nIn vitro research suggests that grapefruit juice might inhibit CYP2C19 enzymes (12479). Also, a small clinical study shows that taking grapefruit juice with clopidogrel, an antiplatelet prodrug that is metabolized primarily by CYP2C19, decreases plasma levels of the active metabolite and impairs the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. This effect is likely due to grapefruit-induced inhibition of CYP2C19 (91419).\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, grapefruit juice might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C9.\nIn vitro research suggests that grapefruit juice might inhibit CYP2C9 enzymes (12479). So far, this interaction has not been reported in humans.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice can inhibit CYP3A4 metabolism of drugs, causing increased drug levels and potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects (3227, 3774, 8283, 8285, 8286, 22129, 91427, 104190). When taken orally, effects of grapefruit juice on CYP3A4 levels appear to last at least 48 hours (91427). Grapefruit's ability to inhibit CYP3A4 has even been harnessed to intentionally increase levels of venetoclax, which is metabolized by CYP3A4, in an elderly patient with acute myeloid leukemia who could not afford full dose venetoclax. The lower dose of venetoclax in combination with grapefruit juice resulted in serum levels of venetoclax in the therapeutic reference range of full dose venetoclax and positive treatment outcomes for the patient (112287).\n\nProfessional consensus recommends the consideration of patient age, existing medical conditions, additional medications, and the potential for additive adverse effects when evaluating the risks of concomitant use of grapefruit juice with any medication metabolized by CYP3A4. While all patients are at risk for interactions with grapefruit juice consumption, patients older than 70 years of age and those taking multiple medications are at the greatest risk for a serious or fatal interaction with grapefruit juice (95970, 95972).\nless\nDAPOXETINE (Priligy)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of dapoxetine, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of dapoxetine.\nPharmacokinetic research shows that drinking grapefruit juice 250 mL prior to taking dapoxetine 60 mg can increase the maximum plasma concentration of dapoxetine by 80% and prolong the elimination half-life by 43%. This effect is attributed to the inhibition of both intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by grapefruit (95975).\nless\nDEXTROMETHORPHAN (Robitussin DM, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of dextromethorphan, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of dextromethorphan.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice can inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolism, causing increased dextromethorphan levels (11362).\nless\nEMPAGLIFLOZIN (Jardiance)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, grapefruit juice may increase the levels and clinical effects of empagliflozin.\nAnimal research suggests grapefruit juice increases the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of empagliflozin, possibly due to inhibition of metabolism by uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT) (115467). This effect has not been reported in humans.\nless\nERYTHROMYCIN\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of erythromycin, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of erythromycin.\nClinical research shows that concomitant use of erythromycin with grapefruit can inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolism of erythromycin, increasing plasma concentrations of erythromycin by 35% (8286).\nless\nESTROGENS\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of estrogens, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of estrogens.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit increases the levels of endogenous and exogenous estrogens by inhibiting cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes (525, 526, 14858). Grapefruit juice increases exogenously administered 17-beta-estradiol by about 20% in females without ovaries and ethinyl-estradiol in healthy females (525, 526, 22160).\nless\nETOPOSIDE (VePesid)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can decrease blood levels of etoposide, potentially decreasing the clinical effects of etoposide.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice decreases the absorption and plasma concentrations of etoposide. There is some evidence that grapefruit juice co-administered with oral etoposide can reduce levels of etoposide by about 26% (8744). Grapefruit juice seems to inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP), which is a drug transporter in the gut, liver, and kidney (7046, 17603, 17604). Grapefruit juice is thought to affect OATP for only a short time. Therefore, separating drug administration and consumption of grapefruit by at least 4 hours is likely to prevent this interaction (17603, 17604).\nless\nFEXOFENADINE (Allegra)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can decrease blood levels of fexofenadine, thereby decreasing the clinical effects of fexofenadine.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice can significantly decrease oral absorption and blood levels of fexofenadine. In one study, consuming a drink containing grapefruit juice 25% decreased bioavailability of fexofenadine by about 24%. Consuming a full-strength grapefruit juice drink reduced bioavailability by 67% (7046). In another study, consuming grapefruit juice 300 mL decreased fexofenadine levels by 42%. Consuming 1200 mL of grapefruit juice reduced levels by 64% (17602). Similarly, drinking grapefruit juice 240 mL decreased the oral bioavailability of fexofenadine by 25% in another pharmacokinetic study (112288). Fexofenadine manufacturer data indicates that concomitant administration of grapefruit juice and fexofenadine results in larger wheal and flare sizes in research models. This suggests that grapefruit also reduces the clinical response to fexofenadine (17603).\n\nGrapefruit juice seems to inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP), which is a drug transporter in the gut, liver, and kidney (7046, 17603, 17604, 22161).

Additionally, grapefruit juice might interfere with the bioavailability of statins that are substrates of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP).\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice inhibits metabolism and increases absorption and plasma concentrations of statins that are metabolized by CYP3A4. These include lovastatin (527, 11274), simvastatin (3774, 7782, 22127), and atorvastatin (3227, 12179, 22126). Keep in mind that there is considerable variability in the effect of grapefruit juice on drug metabolism, so individual patient response is difficult to predict (7777, 7781).\n\nSome statins, including pravastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin, are not metabolized by CYP3A4. However, grapefruit juice might still affect the bioavailability of these statins. These statins are substrates of OATP. Grapefruit juice can inhibit OATP. Therefore, grapefruit juice may reduce the bioavailability or increase drug levels of these statins depending on the type of OATP. However, grapefruit juice affects OATP for only a short time. Therefore, separating drug administration by at least 4 hours is likely to avoid this interaction (3227, 12179, 17601, 22126, 91420).\nless\nITRACONAZOLE (Sporanox)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can interfere with itraconazole absorption, although the clinical significance of this interaction is unclear.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice can affect itraconazole absorption and might increase or decrease itraconazole levels (310, 17601, 22123).\nless\nLEVOTHYROXINE (Synthroid, others)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nGrapefruit juice can decrease blood levels of levothyroxine, potentially decreasing the effectiveness of levothyroxine.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice modestly decreases levothyroxine levels by 11% by inhibiting organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) (17604, 22163). Grapefruit juice is thought to affect OATP for only a short time. Therefore, separating drug administration and consumption of grapefruit by at least 4 hours is likely to prevent this interaction (17603, 17604).\nless\nLOSARTAN (Cozaar)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can decrease blood levels of the active metabolite of losartan, potentially decreasing the clinical effects of losartan.\nLosartan is an inactive prodrug which must be metabolized to its active form, E-3174, to be effective. In one human study, grapefruit juice reduced losartan metabolism, increased losartan AUC, and reduced the AUC of the major active losartan metabolite, E-3174 (1391).\nless\nMETHADONE (Dolophine)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of methadone, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of methadone.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice inhibits the metabolism of methadone, increasing methadone levels and peak concentrations (17676). In one case, a 51-year-old male taking methadone 90 mg daily and no other medications was found unresponsive. The patient reported drinking grapefruit juice 500 mL daily for 3 days prior to the event. Methadone is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and grapefruit juice-induced inhibition of CYP3A4 is the likely cause of this interaction (102056).\nless\nMETHYLPREDNISOLONE\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of methylprednisolone, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of methylprednisolone.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice can increase the plasma concentration of orally administered methylprednisolone. Grapefruit juice 200 mL three times daily given with methylprednisolone 16 mg increased methylprednisolone half-life by 35%, peak plasma concentration by 27%, and total area under the curve by 75% (3123).\nless\nNADOLOL (Corgard)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice might decrease blood levels of nadolol, potentially decreasing the clinical effects of nadolol.\nNadolol is a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2) (17603, 17604, 22161). Some research shows that grapefruit juice and its constituent naringin can inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP), which can reduce the bioavailability of OATP substrates (17603, 17604, 22161, 91427). However, preliminary clinical research shows that grapefruit juice containing a low amount of naringin does not significantly affect levels of nadolol (91422). It is not known if grapefruit juice containing higher amounts of naringin reduces the bioavailability of nadolol.\nless\nNILOTINIB (Tasigna)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of nilotinib, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of nilotinib.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice inhibits metabolism and increases absorption of nilotinib.

Various clinical studies have shown reduced absorption of OATP substrates when taken with grapefruit, including fexofenadine, acebutolol, aliskiren, celiprolol, levothyroxine, nadolol, and pitavastatin (17603, 17604, 18101, 22126, 22134, 22161, 22163, 91420, 91427, 91428, 112288). Grapefruit juice is thought to affect OATP for only a short time. Therefore, separating drug administration and consumption of grapefruit by at least 4 hours is likely to prevent this interaction (17603, 17604).\nless\nOXYCODONE (Oxycontin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of oxycodone, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of oxycodone.\nOxycodone is metabolized by both cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). A small clinical study shows that grapefruit juice can increase plasma levels of oral oxycodone about 1.7-fold by inhibiting CYP3A4. While the analgesic effects of oxycodone do not seem to be affected, taking grapefruit juice along with oxycodone may theoretically increase the adverse effects of oxycodone (91423).\nless\nP-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice does not seem to affect renal P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Theoretically, it might inhibit intestinal P-gp, but evidence is conflicting.\nWhile most in vitro research shows that grapefruit products inhibit P-gp, (1390, 11270, 11278, 11362, 95976), research in humans is less clear. Two small clinical studies in healthy adults using digoxin as a probe substrate show that grapefruit juice does not inhibit P-gp in the kidneys (11277, 11282). It is unclear whether this applies to intestinal P-gp, for which digoxin is not considered to be a sensitive probe (105568). Grapefruit juice has been shown to reduce levels of fexofenadine (7046, 17602, 112288), and increase levels of quinidine (5067, 22121). However, as both of these drugs are also substrates of other enzymes and transporters, it is unclear what role, if any, intestinal P-gp has in these findings.\nless\nPITAVASTATIN (Livalo)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of pitavastatin, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of pitavastatin.\nPharmacokinetic research shows that taking grapefruit juice with pitavastatin 2-4 mg can increase blood levels of pitavastatin by 13% to 14%. Unlike simvastatin and atorvastatin, pitavastatin is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes. Grapefruit juice appears to increase levels of pitavastatin by inhibiting its uptake by organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) into hepatocytes for metabolism and clearance from the body (22126, 91420). Grapefruit juice seems to increase levels of pitavastatin to a greater degree in patients homozygous for a specific polymorphism (388A>G) in the OATP1B1 gene compared to those heterozygous for this polymorphism (91420).\nless\nPRASUGREL (Effient)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can decrease blood levels of the active metabolite of prasugrel, thereby decreasing the antiplatelet effect of prasugrel.\nPrasugrel is a prodrug that is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) into its active metabolite. A small pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers shows that drinking grapefruit juice 200 mL three times daily for 4 days and taking a single dose of prasugrel 10 mg with an additional 200 mL of grapefruit juice on day 3, results in a 49% lower peak plasma level and a 26% lower overall plasma exposure to the active metabolite when compared with drinking water. However, despite the reduced exposure, platelet aggregation seems to be reduced by an average of only 5% (105567). The clinical significance of this interaction is unclear.\nless\nPRAZIQUANTEL (Biltricide)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice can increase blood levels of praziquantel, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of praziquantel.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice can inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolism of praziquantel. Plasma concentrations of praziquantel can increase by as much as 160% when administered with 250 mL of commercially available grapefruit juice (8282).\nless\nPRIMAQUINE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice may increase blood levels of primaquine, potentially increasing the effects and adverse effects of primaquine.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice increases the bioavailability of primaquine by approximately 20% (22130). The clinical significance of this interaction is not clear.\nless\nQT INTERVAL-PROLONGING DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit or grapefruit juice, especially if consumed in large amounts, can cause additive QT interval prolongation when taken with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potentially increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.\nClinical research in healthy volunteers shows that drinking 6 liters of grapefruit juice over 6 hours prolonged the QTc by a peak amount of 14 milliseconds (ms). This prolongation was similar to the QT prolongation caused by the drug moxifloxacin. In individuals with long QT syndrome, a smaller dose of grapefruit juice, 1.5 liters, resulted in a greater peak QTc prolongation of about 30 ms (100249). The effect of smaller quantities of grapefruit juice on the QT interval is unclear.\nless\nQUETIAPINE (Seroquel)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGrapefruit juice may increase blood levels of quetiapine, increasing the effects and adverse effects of quetiapine.\nQuetiapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Grapefruit can inhibit CYP3A4 (3227, 3774, 8283, 8285, 8286, 22129, 91427, 104190). In one case report, a healthy 28-year-old female with bipolar disorder stabilized on quetiapine 800 mg daily presented with quetiapine toxicity considered to be related to consuming a gallon of grapefruit juice over the past 24 hours (108848).\nless\nQUINIDINE\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nGrapefruit juice can alter blood levels of quinidine, potentially increasing or decreasing the clinical effects of quinidine.\nClinical research shows that grapefruit juice decreases quinidine absorption, clearance, and metabolism, and prolongs the half-life by about 20% (5067, 22121).\nless\nRIVAROXABAN (Xarelto)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, grapefruit juice may increase the concentration and clinical effects of rivaroxaban.\nRivaroxaban is metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).

Grapefruit and grapefruit juice can inhibit CYP3A4 and increase levels of some drugs metabolized by this enzyme. One small clinical study shows that drinking 200 mL of grapefruit juice three times daily can increase the bioavailability of sunitinib by 11% (91429). While this effect is unlikely to be clinically significant, patients should use caution when using grapefruit along with sunitinib.

Advise postmenopausal adults to avoid consuming large amounts of grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which metabolizes estrogen. Some population research has found that consuming a quarter or more of a whole grapefruit daily is associated with a 25% to 30% increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal adults (14858).\nless",
            "Interactions with Lab Tests": "None known.",
            "Overdose": "There is insufficient reliable information available about presentation or treatment of overdose with grapefruit.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nNaringenin, naringin, hesperidin, other flavanones, and furanocoumarins have been identified in human plasma following grapefruit juice consumption (53374, 91424, 95977). However, bioavailability is thought to be low (53374, 95977). Furanocoumarins reach peak plasma concentrations within 30 to 60 minutes after grapefruit juice or whole grapefruit consumption (95977).\nMetabolism\nIn human research, citrus flavanones and furanocoumarins absorbed after drinking grapefruit juice undergo glucuronidation (53374, 95977).\nExcretion\nIn humans, consumption of grapefruit juice results in urinary excretion of flavanone, furanocoumarins and their metabolites, and other constituents (53374, 95977). Furanocoumarins appear in the urine as soon as 1 hour after grapefruit juice or whole grapefruit consumption, reach peak urine concentrations within 2 to 4 hours, and remain in the urine in small but measurable concentrations at 24 hours (95977).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of grapefruit are the fruit, juice, oil from the peel, and seed extract. Grapefruit is high in fiber and contains significant amounts of potassium, vitamin C, pectin, and other nutrients. In addition to these nutrients, active constituents include flavonoids such as naringin and furanocoumarins including bergamottin, bergaptol, and bergapten (3769, 7778, 13031, 53338, 95973). Grapefruit seeds contain numerous constituents including naringin, nomilin, deacetyl-nomilin, nomilinic-acid-17-O-beta-D-glucoside, deacetyl-nomilinic-acid-17-O-beta-D-glucoside, limonol, deoxy-limonol, 7-obacunol, obacunone, epi-iso-obacunoic-acid-17-O-beta-D-glucoside, iso-obacunoic-acid-17-O-beta-D-glucoside, and trans-obacunoic-acid-17-O-beta-D-glucoside (513).\nAnti-asthmatic effects\nThe potential benefits of grapefruit in asthma might be due to antioxidant properties of vitamin C or other grapefruit constituents (6049, 6054, 6055).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn vitro data suggests that grapefruit juice may have anti-inflammatory effects. The furanocoumarin components of grapefruit juice demonstrate modest anti-inflammatory activity in laboratory research (95973).\nAnticancer effects\nMultiple components of grapefruit juice, including naringin, hesperidin, and furanocoumarins, have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity in breast cancer, skin cancer, and leukemia. In vitro studies of bergapten and bergamottin show that these constituents can suppress STAT3 and nuclear factor kappa B expression, activate p53 and caspases, inhibit activation of benzo[a]pyrene (BAP) in skin cancer cells, and deplete estrogen receptors in breast cancer cells (95973).\nAntimicrobial effects\nA commercial citrus seed extract used at a concentration of 0.5% has been reported to inhibit the in vitro growth of some bacteria, yeasts, and molds (Streptococcus species, Staph. aureus, enterococci, Enterobacter, E. coli, Candida, Geotrichum, Aspergillus, and Penicillium species) (5866). Grapefruit seed extracts have been reported to reduce counts of Salmonella typhimurium when sprayed on chicken skins (5862), but to have no effect in controlling fungal growth on unshelled peanuts (5864, 5865).\n\nHowever, antimicrobial activity of grapefruit seed extract products may be due to preservatives in the products. When examined by HPLC, a commercial grapefruit seed extract was found to contain significant amounts of the preservatives methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate and triclosan, which were not present in an ethanol extract of grapefruit seeds (5863). In another study, five of six commercial grapefruit seed extracts tested contained significant amounts of the preservative benzethonium chloride, and three of these extracts contained triclosan and methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate. These five extracts had significant antibacterial activity, as measured by in vitro tests, but a sixth commercial extract that was preservative-free had no in vitro antibacterial activity (5867). It has therefore been hypothesized that the reported antimicrobial activity of grapefruit seed extract products is due to the preservative content (5867).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant activity of grapefruit is possibly due to a number of components, including flavonoids and furanocoumarins, which have been shown to scavenge free radicals in laboratory research (95973).\nBone density effects\nLaboratory research suggests that grapefruit juice may affect bone density. In vitro and animal research has demonstrated that bergapten, a furanocoumarin found in grapefruit juice, might promote bone formation and inhibit bone resorption (95973).\nCardiovascular effects\nDue to their flavonoid content, grapefruit and other citrus fruits are being investigated for preventing cardiovascular disease. Healthy volunteers and cardiomyopathy patients who consume grapefruit juice seem to have a prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiogram (ECG). Grapefruit flavonoids, specifically naringenin, are thought to antagonize cardiac potassium channels and therefore decrease cardiac repolarization. This suggests a possible antiarrhythmic effect of grapefruit juice with a mechanism similar to class III antiarrhythmic drugs (13031, 91424).\n\nIt is possible that there are other beneficial effects of grapefruit constituents not related to effects on heart rhythm. In human research, both grapefruit pectin and whole grapefruit reduce high levels of cholesterol and other lipids (2216, 53352). Also, grapefruit pectin may have a direct beneficial effect on atherosclerosis by a mechanism independent of cholesterol levels as shown in animal research (53370).\nCortisol metabolism effects\nIn human and laboratory research, dietary flavonoids in grapefruit juice inhibit the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which oxidizes cortisol to inactive cortisone. In high doses, this may cause a mineralocorticoid effect resulting in increased potassium clearance (3254, 53345). It has been suggested that although an inhibitory effect on the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase cannot be ruled out, grapefruit juice may also increase the ratio of cortisol to cortisone by increasing cortisol excretion in a manner involving an impairment of cortisol metabolism related to CYP 3A4 (91431).\nDrug metabolism effects\nThe effect of grapefruit juice on drugs is difficult to predict because the uptake of compounds such as naringenin and other constituents varies greatly among individuals (3775, 7777, 7779, 11273). Grapefruit juice flavonoids, including naringin, naringenin, limonin, quercetin, kaempferol, and obacunone, inhibit human hepatic microsomes (7778). Grapefruit juice furanocoumarins, including bergamottin and dihydroxybergamottin, inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (3769, 5070, 5071, 11273). In addition, bergamottin inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 (5072, 53344). However, it is likely that multiple constituents of grapefruit juice are responsible for its inhibition of CYP3A4 (11276). In some studies, bergamottin has not been confirmed as the primary constituent responsible for CYP3A4 inhibition (11976). One study found that a hybrid grapefruit juice containing low levels of furanocoumarins, including bergamottin, did not have the same magnitude of effect on CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of midazolam as a standard grapefruit juice, but the clinical significance of this difference is unclear (95978). Early in vitro research indicates that naringenin and dihydroxybergamottin do not measurably alter the activity of human CYP1A1 (95979).\n\nGrapefruit juice selectively inhibits gut wall CYP3A4 and increases bioavailability and plasma concentrations of numerous drugs (1386). In higher doses, it may also inhibit hepatic CYP3A4 (7776, 11275). Human research indicates that blended grapefruit segments, and an extract of grapefruit core and peel, also inhibit CYP3A4 activity (1388). Research on triazolam suggests that single doses of grapefruit juice increase plasma concentrations by inhibiting intestinal CYP3A4 during first pass metabolism. Repeated consumption of grapefruit juice inhibits hepatic CYP3A4 and prolongs elimination half-life (7776). Grapefruit juice appears to irreversibly inhibit CYP3A4, possibly leading to a down-regulation of CYP3A4. Within 4 hours, grapefruit juice reduces intestinal CYP3A4 by 47% (11273). The maximum effect on drug metabolism appears to be within 24 hours of grapefruit consumption, but reduced drug metabolism can occur to a lesser degree for 3-7 days (7778, 7782, 11362). Research on midazolam suggests that recovery of gut wall CYP3A4 function occurs 3 days after a single exposure to grapefruit juice (10159). For some drugs, such as felodipine and nisoldipine, it may be necessary to allow a 3-day interval between grapefruit juice and drug administration to avoid interactions (5068, 5069). Therefore, separating drug administration from grapefruit consumption will not prevent these potential interactions (17601).\nDrug transporter effects\nMost in vitro research shows that grapefruit products inhibit the drug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (4736, 1390, 11270, 11278, 11362, 95976). However, research in humans using digoxin as a probe for P-gp shows that grapefruit juice has little effect on this transporter in the kidneys (11277, 11282). It is unclear whether this applies to intestinal P-gp, for which digoxin is not considered to be a sensitive probe (105568). Grapefruit juice has been shown to reduce levels of fexofenadine (7046, 17602, 112288), and increase levels of quinidine (5067, 22121), but since these drugs are also substrates of other enzymes and transporters, it is unclear what role, if any, intestinal P-gp plays. Further research is needed to determine if grapefruit inhibits intestinal P-gp.\n\nResearch also shows that consuming grapefruit juice inhibits organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs), which results in reduced bioavailability of some oral drugs (11278, 17601, 17602). It is thought that the flavonoid naringin is responsible for most of this inhibitory activity (17606). The effect on OATP1A appears to be short-term. Separating drug administration and grapefruit consumption by at least 4 hours likely will prevent this interaction (17603, 17604).\nWeight loss effects\nIn human and laboratory studies, grapefruit flavonoids have demonstrated activity as catalysts of lipolysis, breaking down triglycerides stored in fat cells and stimulating the release of fatty acids and glycerol. Flavonoid-induced lipolysis occurs through inhibition of cAMP-phosphodiesterase and maintenance of lipolysis-inducing cAMP levels. Stimulation of adipose tissue lipolysis may upregulate the use of lipid energy by the body. This effect was demonstrated in the laboratory setting with a compound (Sinetrol, Fytexia) containing naringin (16.7%), polyphenols (60%), anthocyanins (2%), and caffeine (3.6%) (95517). Administration of a similar compound to human subjects resulted in a significant increase in serum free fatty acids compared to placebo (95518)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of graviola are the fruit, seeds, leaves, roots, and bark. Many active constituents have been identified, including over 220 types of acetogenins (7857, 95045). The most common acetogenin is annonacin (95045). Acetogenins may be responsible for the toxic effects of graviola, such as myeloneuropathy. Methanolic extracts of the seed, fruit pulp, or pericarp of graviola are the most toxic (95045). Graviola leaf extracts have been reported to contain acetogenins in concentrations of approximately 3 to 15 mg/grams. Other animal research suggests that an acetogenin-enriched leaf extract is more toxic than a non-enriched extract (95045). Graviola also contains isoquinolone compounds, alkaloids such as reticuline and coreximine, flavonoids, sterols, and phenols such as quercetin and gallic acid (7876, 95045). A higher concentration of alkaloids is found in the leaves (95045).\n\nOther constituents include vitamins, carotenoids, essential oils, and triterpenoids (95045, 95047).In an oil seed extract, the highest fatty acid concentrations consisted of linoleic acid and palmitic acid (95047). Flavonoids, volatile compounds, and tocopherols have also been found in the pulp (95045). Amide and cyclopeptides have also been found in graviola (95045).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGraviola may attenuate tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta protein expression (92875). In laboratory research, graviola extract lead to decreased levels of inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide and interleukin-6. In animals, similar efficacy to indomethacin has been reported (95045).\n\nGraviola, possibly due to the presence of flavonoids, has also been reported to possess anti-nociceptive effects in animals, possibly via inhibition inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases (95045).\nAntibacterial effects\nLaboratory research suggests that extracts of graviola are effective against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Methanolic and ethanolic extracts may be more effective than aqueous extracts. Flavonoids, steroids, and alkaloids are thought to be the constituents responsible for this action. Alkaloids may inhibit glycosidase and bind the DNA of some bacteria leading to inhibition of RNA synthesis. Flavonoids may inhibit DNA synthesis and cytoplasmic membrane function (95045).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn an animal model of diabetes, leaf extracts lowered blood glucose and increased antioxidant activity. These extracts also exhibited a protective effect on beta-cells (95045). Leaf extract of graviola may also promote regeneration of beta-cells in the pancreas (92875). Laboratory research suggests that flavonoids in graviola inhibit alpha-glucosidase, decreasing carbohydrate metabolism and absorption. The alkaloids in graviola may also be responsible for these effects (95045).\nAntineoplastic effects\nThere is interest in using graviola for its antineoplastic effects. Graviola extracts have exhibited antineoplastic effects against many cancer cell lines in laboratory research (95045, 112852). Additionally, in vitro experiments suggest there may be additive cytotoxic effects when used in combination with valproic acid but antagonistic cytotoxic effects with carbamazepine (112852). In animals, graviola extracts have reduced tumor size in various cancer models.\n\nGraviola extracts made with organic solvents may be more active than those made from aqueous solvents (95045). Acetogenins including annomuricin E, bullatacin, squamocin, and annonacin are reported to be responsible for these effects (95045). The cytotoxic action of the acetogenins is mediated via inhibition of the mitochondrial complex and suppression of phosphorylation of key molecules involved in proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Additionally, acetogenins disrupt the mitochondrial membrane leading to cell cycle arrest and induce apoptosis via reactive oxygen species. Acetogenins also decrease glucose uptake and adenosine triphosphate production. Annomuricin E has been reported to alter the mitochondrial membrane potential leading to leakage of pro-apoptotic proteins. It also causes downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and mRNA and increases pro-apoptotic proteins and mRNA . It has also been reported to restore levels of antioxidant enzymes and reduce the production of lipid radicals caused by reactive oxygen species (95045, 95048). Flavonoids and alkaloids may also play a role in these effects and may act synergistically (95045).\nAntioxidant effects\nGraviola may possess antioxidants including catalase and superoxide dismutase (92875). It is believed the phenols are responsible for this effect. Of note, different infusions may possess different amounts of phenols (95045).\nAntiparasitic effects\nExtracts of the leaf, root, stem, and bark of graviola are toxic to snails in concentrations of 60 to 100 parts per million. This action may be useful for controlling a vector for schistosomiasis (10379). Laboratory research also suggests activity against protozoans responsible for human diseases including malaria, leishmaniasis, chagas, and amebiasis (95045). Graviola seed extracts have shown higher activity, and components such as alkaloids, acetogenin, anonaine, and gallic acid have exhibited anti-plasmodial effects. Acetogenins may inhibit nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase leading to inhibition of mitochondrial complex I. This damages the respiration chain and function of the cell (95045). Phenolic compounds in graviola also inhibited the activity of enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and growth in Plasmodium falciparum (95045).\n\nIn mice infected with Plasmodium berghei, an aqueous leaf extract of graviola exhibited dose dependent inhibition with prolonged survival time (95045). Alkaloids in graviola may inhibit an antioxidant enzyme found in Leishmania and Trypanosoma that normally protects the parasites from reactive oxygen species (95045).\n\nIn animals, extracts of graviola seeds have also been reported to be effective against lice infestation (95045).\n\nIn a laboratory setting, adult mosquitos of both Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus were exposed to various concentrations of aqueous and oil extracts of graviola seed. Results of this study suggest that both aqueous and oil extracts are effective against adult and larval stages of these two types of mosquitos. The dichloromethane graviola extract may be more effective than the reference drug tested, deltamethrin. Additionally, aqueous extracts appear to have higher insecticidal effects at higher concentrations, due to the alkaloids present. Overall, Aedes albopictus mosquitos appear to be more sensitive for all extracts and concentrations. Acetogenins, alkaloids, and flavonoids all are reported to contribute to these effects (95047). Additionally, fatty acids may be toxic for numerous reasons through inhalation, aggregation on the surface of water not allowing respiration for aquatic organisms, and by penetration (95047).\nAntiviral effects\nLaboratory research suggests an ethanolic extract of graviola bark has activity against Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1 mg/mL. This extract does not exhibit toxicity toward uninfected cells in culture (7855). Polyphenol compounds are possibly responsible for this effect (95045).\nCardiovascular effects\nThere is interest in using graviola leaf extract to treat hypertension. Animal research in normotensive and hypertensive rats and cats shows that taking oral graviola leaf extract 50-150 mg/kg daily for 1-14 days, alone or in combination with avocado leaf extract, reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate when compared with control (106053).\nGastroprotective effects\nIn rats, graviola leaf extracts have exhibited gastroprotective effects in ethanol induced models of ulcerogenesis, possibly via its antioxidant effects. It restores the activity of antioxidant enzymes reducing reactive oxygen species damage to the gastric wall. It also attenuates acidity and decreases the loss of gastric wall mucus that may occur with excessive gastric acid production in patients with ulcers (95045).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nLaboratory research suggests that extracts of graviola possess immunomodulatory activity. Extracts enhanced immunity via activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. This lead to increases in transcriptional expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1alpha (95045). In mice, graviola led to increases in white cells, T-cells, and natural killer cells (95045). This suggests graviola may boost the innate immune system in patients who are immunocompromised.\nNeurologic/CNS effects\nGraviola contains isoquinolone compounds, which contribute to the neurotoxicity caused by preparations containing this plant (95045).The toxicity varies depending on which part of the plant is used as well as which solvent (95045).\n\nThe alkaloids contained in graviola are toxic to dopaminergic and GABAnergic neurons in extremely low concentrations. The chloroform extract, which contains all of the alkaloids found in graviola, is toxic to dopaminergic neurons at a concentration of 10 mcg/mL (7876). Acetogenins have also been shown to be toxic to dopaminergic cells via impairment of energy production (95045). They inhibit the first complex within the mitochondrial respiratory chain (95046). In animals, annonacin, the major acetogenin in graviola, entered the brain and decreased levels of adenosine triphosphate leading to neurodegeneration. However, one study in animals suggested that this neurodegeneration did not lead to changes in behavior or locomotor activity (95045, 95046).\n\nThe alkaloids in graviola however, may also and be involved in dopamine biosynthesis and thus have a role as an antidepressant or sedative. Alkaloids, including anonaine and asimilobine reportedly have relaxant effects via the 5-HT1A receptor which binds with serotonin (95045). In rats, graviola leaf extract exhibited sedative and antidepressant effects in an open field and swim test, and when combined with imipramine or sertraline, exhibited further efficacy (95045)."

            "Overview": "Great plantain is a perennial plant with broad leaves. It originated in Europe as well as northern and central regions of Asia, but it is now commonly found around the world as a weed. Great plantain has traditionally been used as medicine for wound healing and treating various dermatological, gastrointestinal, and respiratory conditions (97739, 97741, 97742, 104213, 104214).",

            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nBurns. It is unclear if topical great plantain is beneficial for burns.\nA very small clinical study in hospitalized adults with bilateral second degree burns shows that applying great plantain extract 10% ointment to burns on one side of the body is similarly effective to applying silver sulfadiazine 1% ointment daily to burns on the other side of the body in relation to healing time, pain intensity, and rate of wound infections (110088). Due to its small size, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nCough. Oral great plantain has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small study in children 3-6 years of age with acute cough shows that taking a specific syrup (KalobaTUSS, Schwabe Pharma Italia Srl) based on acacia honey with extracts of great plantain, elecampane, mallow, and sandy everlasting, as 5 mL four times daily for 8 days, produces rapid and sustained reductions in both nighttime and daytime cough scores when compared with placebo (105734). It is unclear if these findings are due to great plantain, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if topical great plantain is beneficial for diabetic foot ulcers.\nA small unblinded clinical study in hospitalized adults in Iran with Wagner's stage 1 or 2 diabetic foot ulcers or stage 2 or 3 pressure ulcers based on the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel system shows that applying great plantain extract 10% gel for 14 days reduces wound size and erythema when compared to treatment with various standard wound dressings. Complete wound healing may also occur more frequently at 2 weeks with topical great plantain extract (110090). Poor study methodology and a lack of sub-analysis by ulcer type limits the reliability of these findings. Another small clinical study in patients with a Wagner's stage 1 or 2 diabetic foot ulcer receiving oral antibiotics shows that applying a topical product containing great plantain and aloe twice daily for 4 weeks reduces ulcer surface area and healing time when compared with antibiotics alone. However, the combination product has no effect on ulcer depth (97323). It is unclear if these findings are due to great plantain, aloe, or the combination.\nless\nMenorrhagia. It is unclear if oral great plantain leaf extract is beneficial in patients with menorrhagia.\nA small clinical trial in adults with abnormal uterine bleeding shows that taking a syrup containing great plantain leaf 12% extract 3 times a day for the first 5 days of menstruation and repeating over 3 cycles reduces bleeding severity, but not bleeding duration, similarly to mefenamic acid 250 mg taken every 8 hours (104214).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral great plantain seed is beneficial in patients with NAFLD.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with NAFLD shows that taking great plantain seed 1000 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves fatty liver grade on ultrasound and reduces levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and triglycerides when compared with placebo (106645).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral great plantain leaf is beneficial in patients with obesity.\nOne small clinical trial in females with obesity shows that taking powdered great plantain leaf 400 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight or body mass index when compared with placebo (106642).\nless\nOral mucositis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral great plantain extract might reduce the severity of oral mucositis, but rinsing with great plantain solution does not seem to be superior to sodium bicarbonate or chlorhexidine for improving healing time.\nA small clinical study in adults undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer shows that taking a syrup containing great plantain extract 7.5 mL three times daily for 7 weeks reduces the severity of oral mucositis when compared with placebo. Patients taking great plantain syrup also reported lower pain scores as measured on a visual analogue scale when compared with those taking placebo (104213). However, a small clinical trial in cancer patients with oral mucositis shows that there is no difference in the healing time of lesions for patients rinsing with either sodium bicarbonate 5%, great plantain 5%, or chlorhexidine 0.12% solutions. All three solutions were used as a rinse for 2 minutes every 6 hours for up to 2 weeks (98209).\nless\nPressure ulcers. It is unclear if topical great plantain is beneficial in patients with pressure ulcers.\nOne small clinical trial in patients with pressure ulcers being treated with topical phenytoin cream shows that application of great plantain 10% cream 12 hours after application of phenytoin daily for 2 weeks improves healing rate when compared with phenytoin and placebo (106643). Another small, unblinded clinical study in hospitalized adults in Iran with stage 2 or 3 pressure ulcers based on the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel system or Wagner's stage 1 or 2 diabetic foot ulcers shows that applying great plantain extract 10% gel for 14 days reduces wound size and erythema when compared to a treatment with various standard wound dressings.

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of great plantain.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of great plantain are the leaf and seed. Great plantain contains alpha-linolenic acid; flavonoids including luteolin, apigenin, and quercetin; alkaloids such as indicain and plantagonin; terpenoids such as ursolic acid and oleanolic acid; caffeic acid derivatives including plantamajoside; and iridoid glycosides such as aucubin (97741, 97742, 104213, 106643). The leaves also contain relatively high concentrations of vitamins K and C, as well as carotenoids (97741). Polysaccharides of interest are found in the seeds and leaves of great plantain (97741, 97742).\nAnti-diarrheal effects\nGreat plantain is traditionally used for diarrhea. In animal models, great plantain extract was shown to reduce gastrointestinal motility. The constituent tannins, flavonoids, and alkaloids might play a role (97741).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn laboratory models, great plantain extract inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators, such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and interleukins. Constituent iridoid glycosides, ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, caffeic acid derivatives, and flavonoids likely play a role, including inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (97741, 97742, 104213). Polysaccharides in plantain leaves also have anti-inflammatory effects (97742).\nAnticancer effects\nGreat plantain leaf extract inhibits carcinogenesis and mammary tumor formation in experimental animals. In vitro, great plantain extract has cytotoxic effects against at least some cell lines. Ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and flavonoids are thought to be involved (97741, 104213). The major flavonoid constituent, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, interferes with DNA topoisomerase I and inhibits leukemic cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis. Suppression of leukocyte migration may also occur (104214).\nAntimicrobial effects\nPreliminary laboratory research suggests great plantain leaf has antibacterial, anti-parasitic, and antifungal activity (12666, 97741, 97742). However, an extract of the great plantain husk does not have antibacterial activity against common periodontal pathogens (97738).\nCardiovascular effects\nIn animals, great plantain extract lowers blood pressure, and decreases total plasma lipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides (4).\nGastrointestinal effects\nThere is interest in using great plantain for ulcerative colitis. In rats with induced ulcerative colitis, great plantain leaf extract injection improved markers of colon damage and oxidative stress and lowered levels of interleukins, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and prostaglandin E2. However, effects were larger in animals that were treated with sulfasalazine (110089).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nIn vitro, there were dose-dependent effects of extracts of great plantain resulting in changes to cell-mediated immunity. How this translates to changes in animal models or humans is unclear (97739).\nRespiratory effects\nGreat plantain is used traditionally for respiratory illnesses. In guinea pigs, an aqueous extract had bronchodilator effects; however, effects were less and had shorter duration than salbutamol or atropine (4).\nWound healing effects\nGreat plantain leaves are traditionally used for wound healing. Polysaccharides, polyphenols, and allantoin in the leaves are thought to be involved with the wound healing effects in laboratory models, possibly related to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity (97741, 97323)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of greater burnet are the flowering above ground parts and the roots (4, 37452). Greater burnet contains tannins; phenolic acids; catechins; proanthocyanidins; flavonols; sanguiins, including sanguiin H-6, a cytotoxic dimeric ellagitannin; triterpenes, such as rosamultin, ziyuglycoside I, and alpinoside; and terpenoids (37452, 37453, 103054, 107908).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro research shows that greater burnet extracts have activity against various cancer cell lines, including pancreatic, colorectal, bladder, and leukemia. Leaf extracts appear to have the greatest anti-cancer effects, followed by flower and root extracts. Stem extracts have marginal anti-cancer activity. The precise mechanism of action is unknown (107908).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nIn a mouse model of ulcerative colitis, greater burnet reduces interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (115620). Additionally, in various animal models, application of, a greater burnet extract, or of its major flavonoid rhoifolin, reduces pro-inflammatory markers in wound tissues (115622, 115623).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research shows that greater burnet root extract has activity against Helicobacter pylori, including multi-drug-resistant strains of H. pylori. When combined with clarithromycin, metronidazole, amoxicillin, or levofloxacin, greater burnet appears to have additive antimicrobial activity (107909). Additionally, in vitro research shows that the major flavonoid present in greater burnet, rhoifolin, has antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (115622).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn vitro research shows that greater burnet extracts have antioxidant effects. The antioxidant activity appears to be greater with flower and leaf extracts when compared with root or stalk extracts (107908). In animal research, greater burnet extract reduces malondialdehyde levels and increases expression of antioxidant enzymes and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) (115621). Furthermore, in a rat model of obesity,greater burnet extract increases antioxidant enzymes and PPAR-α in a dose-dependent manner (115625).\nBleeding effects\nGreater burnet is traditionally used for external and internal bleeding. It appears to have antihemorrhagic, antihemorrhoidal, astringent, and styptic properties (4).\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using greater burnet to improve wound healing and reduce wrinkle formation. In various animal models of wounds, application of the major flavonoid, rhoifolin, or purified polysaccharide extract of greater burnet reduces wound size, speeds epithelialization, and increases growth factors when compared with no treatment (103057, 115622). Other animal research shows that applying a cream containing the greater burnet constituent ziyuglycoside I reduces UVB-induced wrinkle formation, wrinkle depth, and collagen degradation in hairless mice (103056).\nEnzymatic effects\nIn vitro research shows that greater burnet extracts inhibit the activity of alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase, suggesting some potential for these extracts in the management of diabetes and obesity. Flower extracts appear to have the greatest inhibitory effect on alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activity, while leaf extracts appear to the have greatest effect on pancreatic lipase activity (107908).\nErgogenic effects\nIn vitro research shows that greater burnet reduces the activity of lactate dehydrogenase A and decreases lactate levels, suggesting that supplementation with greater burnet might decrease the build-up of lactic acid in muscles and improve fatigue during exercise. This is supported by animal research showing that greater burnet improves endurance in mice during a treadmill test (107910).\nGastrointestinal effects\nIn a mouse model of ulcerative colitis, greater burnet demonstrates a reparative and protective effect via increasing goblet cells and mucin glycoproteins and regulating the P13K-AKT pathway (115620). Additionally, in a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, greater burnet extract reduces gut microbiota diversity while increasing Lactobacillus (115621).\nWeight loss effects\nIn an animal model of obesity, greater burnet extract reduced body weight and white adipose tissue in a dose-dependent manner (115625)."

Greater celandine can also cause rash (13410). Greater celandine extract has caused a single case of hemolytic anemia (53508).\n\nTopically, greater celandine can cause contact dermatitis (13411).\n\nIntravenously, a derivative of the greater celandine constituent chelidonine (Ukrain) can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, increased body temperature, general burning sensations, and bleeding (13409, 53460).\nDermatologic\nOrally, greater celandine can cause rash (13410).

The cause is unknown, but appears to be idiopathic. It seems to be independent of dose, and the amount of time before development of liver disease is generally long and variable (363, 53506). The main symptom is usually jaundice (53506). Liver enzymes are elevated at least two-fold in all cases where measurements were completed (53506). Although other causes of liver toxicity cannot be ruled out in some cases, many reported cases of hepatotoxicity are probably or likely associated with the use of greater celandine. Recurrence of hepatitis with unintentional re-exposure has also been reported (53506, 94282). Discontinuation of greater celandine usually results in a fairly rapid recovery although liver enzymes need months to return to normal (53506, 94282). Death has occurred in one patient with hepatitis due to bleeding associated with colonic diverticulitis. Causality was described as possible, not probable, in this case (53506).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nIntravenously, a derivative of the greater celandine constituent chelidonine (Ukrain) can cause increased body temperature and general burning sensations (13409).\nless",

Preliminary clinical research suggests that injecting a specific semi-synthetic derivative of the greater celandine constituent chelidonine (Ukrain; not available in North America) intravenously helps improve survival of some patients with colorectal, bladder, pancreatic, lung, or breast cancer. However, poor study design makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the efficacy of Ukrain for cancer (13409, 53460, 53472, 53473, 53497, 53498). Also, some researchers suggest that doses sufficiently high to shrink tumors might be too toxic for clinical use (13412). In addition to assessing Ukrain, some research has assessed the effects of a greater celandine decoction in cancer patients.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of greater celandine are the dried above ground parts and to a lesser extent the rhizome and root. The above ground and the underground parts contain similar constituents, but in different proportions. The above ground parts contain the benzophenanthridine alkaloids chelidonine (up to 1.4% dry weight), berberine, and coptisine. Chelerythrine and sanguinarine (pseudochelerythrine) are the main alkaloids in the roots (13408).\nAnti-cancer effects\nIn vitro and animal research suggests that greater celandine might be useful for some types of cancer. Cytotoxic alkaloids found in greater celandine seem to promote apoptosis in cancer cells (13412, 48716, 53517, 53537). Furthermore, animal research has found that greater celandine extract reduces growth of glandular stomach cancer (53504, 94282). Preliminary research suggests that chelidonine, sanguinarine, and chelerythrine might have activity against cells of uveal melanoma, a particularly difficult cancer to treat (13407).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research suggests that greater celandine might have anti-inflammatory effects, possibly reducing symptoms of arthritis and pain. Greater celandine appears to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and modify the activity of T cells and B cells (53504, 53538, 94282). The constituent stylopine inhibits inflammation by reducing the activity of cyclooxygenase-2 and the levels of nitrous oxide (53490). Sanguinarine and chelerythrine also seem to have anti-inflammatory effects (13407, 53538).\nAntimicrobial effects\nGreater celandine and some alkaloid constituents have antibacterial and antifungal effects (13407, 13408, 53434, 53504).\nAntispasmodic effects\nThere is some evidence from laboratory research that greater celandine might reduce smooth muscle spasms, potentially reducing symptoms of gastrointestinal pain. The antispasmodic effects appear to be related to constituent alkaloids (53523, 53541).\nAntiulcer effects\nGreater celandine reduces the risk of ulcers in an animal ulcer model. This appears to be related to antioxidant effects of the plant (39761).\nAntiviral effects\nPreliminary research suggests that greater celandine extracts have activity against viruses such as HIV, adenoviruses, herpes virus, and polio virus. Alkaloids in greater celandine seem to inhibit viral reverse transcriptase (13408, 53494).\nCholeretic effects\nAn ethanolic extract of greater celandine increases bile flow (13408). Greater celandine extract seems to reduce slow wave frequency and amplitude in the small intestine, which slows peristaltic movement (13398).\nNeurological effects\nA derivative of chelidonine (Ukrain), which is used intravenously in cancer treatment, also seems to have central nervous system effects. Preliminary research suggests that it stimulates dopaminergic activity and inhibits serotonergic activity, and might have central analgesic activity (13408). Other chemicals from greater celandine might also affect the central nervous system. Some research in vitro shows that chelerythrine, an isoquinoline alkaloid from greater celandine, strongly, selectively, and reversibly inhibits an isoform of recombinant human monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) (99454)."

    "Green Coffee": {
        "sections": {
            "Overview": "\"Green coffee\" refers to the raw or unroasted seeds (beans) of the fruits or berries of Coffea. The beans are processed by drying and hulling without heat or roasting (53631, 104829). Green coffee beans are rich in chlorogenic acids which are present in roasted coffee in much lower quantities due to destruction during the roasting process (17977, 17979).",
            "Warnings": "Up to 67% of ground and instant green coffee samples have been found to be contaminated with the mycotoxin, ochratoxin A. Ochratoxin A is found rarely, and in much lower levels, in raw green coffee beans (104829).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Green coffee extracts taken in doses up to 1000 mg daily, providing up to 500 mg chlorogenic acid, have been used with apparent safety for up to 12 weeks in clinical research (17971, 17972, 103954). A specific green coffee extract (Svetol, Naturex) has been used with apparent safety in doses up to 200 mg five times daily for up to 12 weeks (17981, 17982, 17983).\n\nGreen coffee also contains caffeine, although in lower amounts than regular coffee. One cup of green coffee contains about 20-50 mg of caffeine, compared with about 100 mg in one cup of regular coffee. According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, doses of caffeine up to 400 mg daily are not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults (11733, 98806). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults (98806). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as green coffee, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, green coffee appears to be well-tolerated. Although green coffee contains caffeine, it is present in small quantities which are less likely to cause adverse effects. Green coffee contains about 20-50 mg caffeine per cup, compared with about 100 mg caffeine per cup of brewed coffee.\nCardiovascular\nAlthough acute administration of caffeine, a constituent of green coffee, can cause increased blood pressure, regular consumption does not seem to increase either blood pressure or pulse, even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722, 13739). Drinking one or more cups daily of caffeinated coffee, such as green coffee, also doesn't seem to increase the risk of developing hypertension in habitual coffee drinkers (8033, 13739).\n\nChlorogenic acids found in green coffee extracts may adversely affect plasma homocysteine levels. In one randomized controlled trial, 2 grams of chlorogenic acids (the amount found in about 1.5 L of strong coffee) daily for one week resulted in a 12% increase in plasma homocysteine levels (8035). However, in another trial of green coffee extract in a dose equivalent to 140 mg of chlorogenic acids daily for 4 months, there was a slight decrease in plasma homocysteine levels from baseline, but this did not differ significantly from placebo treatment (17970).\n\nThe diterpenes cafestol and kahweol found in green coffee beans have been implicated in the hypercholesterolemic effects of unfiltered coffee (19336, 53599). However, these compounds are removed from some green coffee extracts. For instance, Svetol (Naturex, South Hackensack, NJ) is reported to contain less than 4 ppm of cafestol and kahweol (88171).\nless\nDermatologic\nPositive skin tests and symptoms of contact allergy have been reported in workers exposed to green coffee bean dust (53568, 53653).\nless\nEndocrine\nSome evidence shows that caffeine, a constituent of green coffee, is associated with fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer, and endometriosis in females; however, this is controversial since findings are conflicting (8043). Restricting caffeine in females with fibrocystic breast conditions doesn't seem to affect breast nodularity, swelling, or pain (8996). A population analysis of the Women's Health Initiative observational study has found no association between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors (108806). Also, a dose-response analysis of 2 low-quality observational studies has found that high consumption of caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (108807).\n\nClinical research in healthy adults shows that increased consumption of caffeine results in increased insulin resistance (91023).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, stomach irritation was reported by one person in a clinical trial of green coffee extract (104831).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the relationship between caffeine, which is found in green coffee, and the risk of osteoporosis is contradictory. Caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium (2669, 10202, 11317). Females identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to be at an increased risk of the detrimental effect of caffeine on bone mass (2669). However, moderate caffeine intake, less than 300 mg per day, does not seem to significantly increase osteoporosis risk in most postmenopausal adults with normal calcium intake (2669, 6025, 10202, 11317).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, dizziness was reported by one person in a clinical trial of green coffee extract (104831).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nConjunctivitis caused by green coffee bean dust in coffee workers has been described in case reports (53657, 53589).\nless\nPsychiatric\nChronic use of caffeine, especially in large amounts, may produce tolerance, habituation, and psychological dependence (3719). Abrupt discontinuation of caffeine may result in physical withdrawal symptoms, including headache, fatigue, drowsiness, decreased physical energy, difficulty concentrating, depression, anxiety, irritability, and reduced alertness (13738). Certain populations such as children and the elderly may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of caffeine (13736).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOccupational exposure to green coffee beans has been documented to cause numerous adverse respiratory reactions, including bronchial reactivity, asthma, and rhinitis (53589, 53641, 53644, 53648, 53650, 53665). Healthy subjects exposed experimentally to green coffee dust displayed acute decreases in expiratory flow rates (53653). In one study, green coffee workers displayed numerous acute respiratory symptoms when exposed to dust; these included coughing, increased sputum, sneezing, difficulty in breathing, running nose, and wheezing; these symptoms resolved after leaving work (53647).\nless",

Although there has been interest in using oral green coffee for diabetes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green coffee for this condition.\nHypercholesterolemia. It is unclear if oral green coffee is beneficial for hypercholesterolemia.\nA meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that taking green coffee extract modestly reduces levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and increases levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), when compared to placebo. There was no effect on triglyceride levels (111048). These changes are unlikely to be clinically significant. In addition, this analysis is limited by the significant heterogeneity of the patient populations and any effect of green coffee extract in patients with hyperlipidemia is unclear. A small preliminary clinical study included in this meta-analysis in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that drinking a beverage containing soluble green coffee 0.7 grams and soluble roasted coffee 1.3 grams (containing chlorogenic acids 148.4 mg per serving) three times daily for 8 weeks reduces LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with baseline (103957). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Furthermore, it is unclear if the benefits are due to green coffee, roasted coffee, or the combination.\nless\nHypertension. It is unclear if oral green coffee extract is beneficial for lowering blood pressure.\nTwo small clinical studies in Japanese adults with mild, untreated hypertension show that taking green coffee extracts providing 50-140 mg chlorogenic acids daily for 4-12 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by 5-10 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3-7 mmHg when compared with placebo (17971, 17972).\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. Oral green coffee extract seems to improve some, but not all, measures of metabolic syndrome.\nIn patients with metabolic syndrome, clinical research shows that taking green coffee extract (Arjuna Natural Extracts Ltd) 400 mg twice daily for 8 weeks improves some measures of metabolic syndrome when compared with placebo. Systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and waist circumference were reduced by a small amount, but there was no effect on glycated hemoglobin, lipid profile, or diastolic blood pressure (104831).\nless\nObesity. Oral green coffee extract may have a small effect on weight loss.\nA meta-analysis of 13 clinical studies in patients with overweight or obesity shows that taking either green coffee extract 90-1000 mg, containing chlorogenic acids 30-500 mg, or pure chlorogenic acid 1200 mg daily for 8-12 weeks reduces weight by about 2 kg and body mass index (BMI) by 0.56 kg/m2 when compared with placebo (103954). Individual clinical studies have used a specific green coffee extract (Svetol, Naturex) (17982, 17983). In the meta-analysis, there was no clear dose-response relationship (103954). This weight loss is unlikely to be clinically significant. In addition, this analysis is limited by the significant heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations.\n\nIn 2014 a trial reporting efficacy of a green coffee extract for treatment of obesity was determined to be \"seriously flawed\" by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), resulting in its retraction by the authors and payment of a significant fine by the sponsoring company (Applied Food Sciences, Inc.) (88168, 88169). This flawed study was not included in the 2020 meta-analysis (103954).\n\nIn contrast to these findings, some clinical research has shown that taking green coffee does not reduce body weight. In one study, taking polyphenols 300 mg twice daily alone or in combination with oat-derived beta-glucans does not affect body weight or body composition when compared to baseline (109208). Also, in overweight or obese patients with breast cancer, a small clinical trial shows that taking green coffee extract (Arjuna Natural Extracts Ltd) 400 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not affect body weight, body composition, or glycemic indices, when compared with placebo (111046).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral green coffee extract is beneficial for PCOS.\nA small clinical trial in patients with PCOS shows that taking green coffee extract (Bonyan Salamat Kasra Company, Iran) 400 mg daily for 6 weeks modestly decreases total cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared with taking placebo. However, there was no effect on glycemic indices, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or body weight (111047).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate green coffee for these uses.",

Caffeine can increase the effects and toxicity of clozapine. Caffeine doses of 400-1000 mg daily inhibit clozapine metabolism (5051). Clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Researchers speculate that caffeine might inhibit CYP1A2. However, there is no reliable evidence that caffeine affects CYP1A2.

There is some concern that combining caffeine, ephedra, and creatine might increase the risk of serious adverse effects. There is a report of ischemic stroke in an athlete who consumed creatine monohydrate 6 grams, caffeine 400-600 mg, ephedra 40-60 mg, and a variety of other supplements daily for 6 weeks (1275). Caffeine might also decrease creatine's possible beneficial effects on athletic performance.

Caffeine can prolong bleeding time and increase the results of a bleeding time test (1701).\nless\nDIABETES\nGreen coffee might interfere with glucose control in patients with diabetes. Until more is known, use with caution. Green coffee contains caffeine. Some research suggests that caffeine might impair postprandial glucose metabolism in people with diabetes and contribute to insulin resistance. The effect of caffeinated beverages and herbs has not been studied (12374, 12375). The caffeine in coffee may enhance the frequency and intensity of hypoglycemic warning symptoms in patients with type 1 diabetes. Theoretically, this may increase the ability of diabetics to detect and treat hypoglycemia early. However, it might also increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740).

Use with caution in patients with urinary incontinence.\nless\nIRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS)\nGreen coffee can contain caffeine, which might exacerbate diarrhea and worsen symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS, especially when caffeine is taken in large amounts (100526).\nless\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nGreen coffee can contain caffeine, which might increase the risk of osteoporosis. Consuming caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium, although it usually remains within the normal range (98806). Some sources suggest that caffeine consumption should be limited to less than 300 mg daily, unless there is adequate calcium supplementation to compensate for calcium losses (2669, 10202, 11317). However, according to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US and Europe, healthy adults with adequate or undetermined calcium intake are not at increased risk of decreased bone mineral density, osteoporosis, or fractures with daily caffeine intakes up to 400 mg (11733, 98806, 100867, 100868). Postmenopausal adults identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to have an 8% higher risk of bone loss from caffeine and should use caffeine with caution (2669).\nless",

Caffeine is a competitive antagonist at adenosine receptors (11771). It is recommended that caffeine and caffeine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, caffeine appears more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine (Adenocard) stress testing (11771). The interaction between caffeine and dipyridamole is unlikely to be significant in stress testing if the heart rate increase is greater than 5% after dipyridamole infusion (11772). Additionally, clinical research shows that caffeine 200 mg and 400 mg given 90 minutes before stress testing, significantly impairs the ability of regadenoson, an adenosine receptor agonist, to detect existing ischemia (91083).\nless\nPHEOCHROMOCYTOMA TESTS\nGreen coffee can contain caffeine, which can increase urine catecholamine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) concentrations (15) and might cause false-positive diagnosis of pheochromocytoma when diagnosis is based on tests of urine VMA or catecholamine concentrations.\nless\nPULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS\nGreen coffee can contain caffeine.

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the presentation of overdose with green coffee. However, green coffee contains caffeine. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine in adults is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram), although fatality has occurred at lower doses (11832, 37908, 37925, 38228, 38229, 91025, 91052, 91070, 97454). In fatal caffeine overdose, the cause of death is usually ventricular fibrillation (11838, 97454). Additional findings on autopsy after fatal overdose have identified acute cardiopulmonary failure and extensive congestion of the internal organs (95956).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with green coffee.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nThe chlorogenic acids (CGAs) are a complex mixture of compounds. In one study, concentrations of CGAs peaked 30-60 minutes after ingestion, and again 90-240 minutes after ingestion, with values varying widely between individuals (53626). Using a specific green coffee extract (Svetol, Naturex), the apparent bioavailability of the CGAs ranged from 7.8% to 72.1%, with a mean of 33 ± 23% (17977). In humans, chlorogenic absorption increased when chlorogenic acid was taken with coconut oil or soybean oil (107666).\n\nFeruloylquinic acids have poor oral bioavailability and are not detected in human plasma. This may be due to limited absorption, presystemic metabolism, or hepatic uptake (17977).\nMetabolism\nAfter ingestion of CGAs, hydrolysis by the gut microflora produces free hydroxycinnamates, including caffeic, ferulic, and p-coumaric acids (53559). Over 50% of ingested CGAs are metabolized by gut bacteria (53579). In the colon, the end-product of this metabolism is hippuric acid (53578).\n\nIn studies using cultured hepatocytes, the green coffee constituents caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and dihydrocaffeic acid were metabolized by cytochrome P450, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and beta-oxidation enzymes. COMT formed ferulic acid and dihydroferulic acid by O-methylation, and O-demethylation occurred via CYP1A1/2 (53567).\nExcretion\nIn humans, about 6% of ingested chlorogenic acid and 11% of ingested caffeic acid were excreted in the urine (18031). The main metabolites excreted in the urine are dihydrocaffeic, gallic, isoferulic, ferulic, vanillic, caffeic, 5-caffeoylquinic, sinapic, p-hydroxybenzoic, and coumaric acids, with considerable interindividual variation (17977, 53626).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGreen coffee beans are coffee beans that have not yet been roasted. The fruits are processed by two different methods, referred to as \"wet\" or \"dry.\" In wet processing, the ripe fruits are mechanically depulped, and mucilaginous residues are removed by fermentation before the beans are dried and hulled. Dry processing involves drying of the whole fruits, then mechanical hulling. The precise chemical composition of the green coffee beans depends on the processing method and duration of storage (53631). The roasting process of coffee beans reduces the levels of chlorogenic acids (17977, 17979). Green coffee extracts therefore contain a higher level of chlorogenic acids compared to regular, roasted coffee. Typically, green coffee beans provide approximately 2-12 grams of chlorogenic acids per 100 grams of beans (17978, 104830).\n\nOther constituents of green coffee beans include caffeine and trace amounts of other methylxanthines such as theobromine and theophylline (53655). Green coffee beans also contain disaccharides, arabinogalactans, galactomannans, cellulose, catechin, epicatechin, chicoric acid, and the amino acids alanine and asparagine (53558, 53564, 53600, 53609, 53668).\n\nSome coffee products may be contaminated with ochratoxin A, a mycotoxin. In one analysis of coffee products, levels of ochratoxin A were highest in green coffee, ranging from 0.3 to 257 mcg/kg. Levels of ochratoxin A seem to be related to the average amount of rainfall, which increases the risk of fungal growth (105309). In another analysis, up to 67% of ground and instant green coffee samples were contaminated with ochratoxin A. This mycotoxin is found rarely, and in much lower levels, in raw green coffee beans (104829).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGreen coffee extract is of interest for its anti-inflammatory effects due to its chlorogenic acid content. In human research, taking green coffee extract 100-6000 mg daily has been shown to reduce levels of C reactive protein (CRP) by 0.017 mg/dL (104830). However, this is unlikely to be clinically significant. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with overweight or obesity or patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) shows that green coffee extract reduces levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), but has no effect on levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), CRP, or other biomarkers of liver function, when compared with placebo (108015).\nAntibacterial effects\nGreen coffee extracts have displayed anti-adhesive effects against Streptococcus mutans, a strain of bacteria commonly found in the mouth that contributes to tooth decay (53562). Caffeic acid, caffeine, trigonelline, and protocatechuic acid from green coffee beans have antimicrobial effects in vitro against Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Salmonella enterica (49665). These strains of bacteria are involved in hospital-acquired infections, urinary tract or respiratory infections, and food poisoning, respectively.\nAntidiabetic effects\nCaffeine has been presumed to contribute to green coffee's antidiabetic effects (53630). Caffeine is thought to reduce glucose storage by increasing epinephrine release in humans (19329, 19331) or by antagonizing the adenosine receptor (19330, 19331). Chlorogenic acids, quinides, and other cinnamates are also thought to be major antidiabetic compounds in green coffee. Meta-analyses in non-diabetic patients show that chlorogenic acid-containing green coffee extract slightly reduces fasting blood glucose and may reduce insulin resistance when compared with placebo (103958, 111049). Chlorogenic acid might reduce hepatic glucose output by inhibiting the glucose-6-phosphate transporter T1 in vitro and in vivo (53551, 53666) and inhibiting hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity in vitro (17981, 50799). Animal studies also suggest that green coffee extracts reduce glucose absorption in the intestines by promoting dispersal of the sodium electrochemical gradient, resulting in an influx of glucose into the enterocytes (17981, 17982, 50799).\nAntihypertensive effects\nCoffee consumption has conflicting effects on blood pressure. Caffeine and caffeinated coffee are known to acutely increase blood pressure; however, green coffee extracts have been shown to have hypotensive effects. This paradox may be explained in part by hydroxyhydroquinone (HHQ), which is produced by roasting and has been shown to inhibit the beneficial effects of chlorogenic acids on blood pressure in a mouse model of hypertension (53601). In a rat model of hypertension, HHQ interfered with the ability of 5-caffeoylquinic acid to improve blood pressure and endothelial function (53636). The hypotensive effects of green coffee extract are thought to be due to ferulic acid, a metabolite of 5-caffeoylquinic acid, which decreases blood pressure and improves vasoreactivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (17971, 19328).\nAntioxidant effects\nGreen coffee has antioxidant activity and scavenges free radicals (17981).Green Coffea robusta beans displayed higher antioxidant activity than green Coffea arabica beans; however, this difference became negligible after roasting (53560). Overall, in vitro antioxidant capacity was found to be higher for green coffee than for roasted samples (53554). The major chlorogenic acid found in green coffee, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, has been shown to have the highest antioxidant activity among several chlorogenic acids tested (53583, 53607). Chlorogenic acid has been shown to prevent the formation of dinitrogen trioxide by scavenging nitrogen dioxide in the human oral cavity (53627). Green coffee extracts have also been shown in vitro to protect against oxidative stress from hydrogen peroxide (53620).\nCardiovascular effects\nA meta-analysis of small clinical studies in a mixed population of mostly healthy adults, as well as patients with overweight or obesity, shows that taking green coffee extract modestly improves some cardiovascular risk factors, including total cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, and body weight, but not high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, when compared with control (108014).\nWeight loss effects\nIn addition to caffeine, chlorogenic acid and quinides found in green coffee are thought to promote weight loss (53611). In mice, a green coffee bean extract had an inhibitory effect on body fat accumulation and weight gain. Caffeine suppressed fat absorption, and chlorogenic acid was found to reduce hepatic triglyceride levels. The phenolic compounds, neochlorogenic acid and feruloylquinic acid were found to enhance hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity (17979). In human research, green coffee extract reduced appetite by a small amount (104831). However, other human research shows that green coffee extract does not result in changes in levels of appetite hormones, including adiponectin, leptin, and neuropeptide Y (111046)."

            "Overview": "Camellia sinensis is a woody plant (89481). The dried leaves and leaf buds are used to produce various types of teas (4218, 89481). Green tea, which accounts for approximately 20% of world tea production, is prepared by steaming and pan-frying these leaves and then drying them (4218). Other teas such as black tea and oolong tea, which are also prepared from Camellia sinensis, involve processes in which the leaves are fermented (black tea) or partially fermented (oolong tea) (4218).",
            "Warnings": "Due to the potential risk for hepatotoxicity with green tea extracts, products claiming compliance with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) quality standards for green tea extract must include the following text on the label: \"Do not take on an empty stomach. Take with food. Do not use if you have a liver problem and discontinue use and consult a healthcare practitioner if you develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)\" (102722).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when green tea is consumed as a beverage in moderate amounts (733, 6031, 9222, 9223, 9225, 9226, 9227, 9228, 14136, 90156)(90159, 90168, 90174, 90184, 95696). Green tea contains caffeine. According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, drinking up to 8 cups of green tea daily, or approximately 400 mg of caffeine, is not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults (11733, 98806). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults (98806). ...when green tea extract cream or ointment is used topically and appropriately, short-term. A green tea extract 3% cream, applied twice daily, has been used with apparent safety for up to 8 weeks, and a specific green tea extract ointment (Veregen, Bradley Pharmaceuticals) providing 15% kunecatechins has been safely used for up to 16 weeks (15067). The safety of treatment for longer durations or multiple treatment courses is not known.\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when green tea extract is used orally. Green tea extract containing 7% to 12% caffeine has been used safely for up to 2 years (8117, 37725). Also decaffeinated green tea extract up to 1.3 grams daily enriched in EGCG has been used safely for up to 12 months (90158, 97131). In addition, green tea extract has been safely used as part of an herbal mixture also containing garcinia, coffee, and banaba extracts for 12 weeks (90137). ...when used topically and appropriately as a cream or mouthwash (6065, 11310, 90141, 90150, 90151).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when consumed as a beverage in large quantities. Green tea contains a significant amount of caffeine. Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, psychological dependence, and other significant adverse effects. Doses of caffeine greater than 600 mg per day, or approximately 12 cups of green tea, have been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmias and sleep disturbances (11832). These effects would not be expected to occur with the consumption of decaffeinated green tea. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as green tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. There is also some speculation that green tea products containing higher amounts of the catechin epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) might have increased risk of adverse events. Some research has found that taking green tea products containing EGCG levels greater than 200 mg is associated with increased risk of mild adverse effects such as constipation, increased blood pressure, and rash (90161). Other research has found that doses of EGCG equal to or above 800 mg daily may be associated with increased risk of liver injury in humans (95440, 95696, 97131).\nLIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in very high doses. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram). Serious toxicity can occur at lower doses depending on variables in caffeine sensitivity such as smoking, age, and prior caffeine use (11832).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally by children and adolescents in amounts commonly found in foods and beverages (4912, 11833). Intake of caffeine in doses of less than 2.5 mg/kg daily is not associated with significant adverse effects in children and adolescents (11733, 98806). ...when used for gargling three times daily for up to 90 days (90150).\nCHILDREN: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of green tea extract when used orally in children. However, taking green tea extract orally has been associated with potentially serious, albeit uncommon and unpredictable cases, of hepatotoxicity in adults. Therefore, some experts recommend that children under the age of 18 years of age do not use products containing green tea extract (94897).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of green tea, pregnant patients should closely monitor their intake to ensure moderate consumption. Fetal blood concentrations of caffeine approximate maternal concentrations (4260). The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects (2708, 2709, 2710, 2711, 9606, 11733, 16014, 16015, 98806). In some studies consuming amounts over 200 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage (16014). This increased risk may be most likely to occur in those with genotypes that confer a slow rate of caffeine metabolism (98806). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, most healthy pregnant patients can safely consume doses up to 300 mg daily without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations (11733, 98806). Advise keeping caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 6 cups of green tea. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as green tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. Based on animal models, green tea extract catechins are also transferred to the fetus, but in amounts 50-100 times less than maternal concentrations (15010). The potential impact of these catechins on the human fetus is not known, but animal models suggest that the catechins are not teratogenic (15011).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in amounts providing more than 300 mg caffeine daily. Caffeine from green tea crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels (4260). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 300 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage in some studies (16014, 98806). Advise keeping caffeine consumption from all sources below 300 mg daily. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 6 cups of green tea. High maternal doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have also resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants (9891). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight (2709, 2711). However, some research has also found that intrauterine exposure to even modest amounts of caffeine, based on maternal blood levels during the first trimester, is associated with a shorter stature in children ages 4-8 years (109846). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as green tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product.\nPREGNANCY: There is also concern that consuming large amounts of green tea might have antifolate activity and potentially increase the risk of folic acid deficiency-related birth defects. Catechins in green tea inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase in vitro (15012). This enzyme is responsible for converting folic acid to its active form. Preliminary evidence suggests that increasing maternal green tea consumption is associated with increased risk of spina bifida (15068). Also, evidence from epidemiological research suggests that serum folate levels in pregnant patients with high green tea intake (57.3 mL per 1000 kcal) are decreased compared to participants who consume moderate or low amounts of green tea (90171). More evidence is needed to determine the safety of using green tea during pregnancy. For now, advise pregnant patients to avoid consuming large quantities of green tea.\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of green tea, nursing parents should closely monitor caffeine intake. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of maternal serum concentrations (9892).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Consumption of green tea might cause irritability and increased bowel activity in nursing infants (6026). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of green tea extracts when applied topically during breast-feeding.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, green tea is generally well tolerated when consumed as a beverage in moderate amounts. Green tea extract also seems to be well tolerated when used for up to 12 months.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Bloating, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, and nausea.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Hepatotoxicity, hypokalemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura have been reported rarely.\nCardiovascular\nAcute or short-term oral administration of green tea may cause hypertension (53719, 54014, 54065, 54076, 102716). The risk may be greater for green tea products containing more than 200 mg epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (90161). However, consumption of brewed green tea does not seem to increase blood pressure or pulse, even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452). In fact, some evidence suggests that habitual tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing hypertension (12518). Also, epidemiological research suggests there is no association of caffeine consumption with incidence of hypertension or with cardiovascular disease mortality in patients with hypertension (13739, 111027). Rarely, green tea consumption may cause hypotension (53867).\n\nEpidemiological research suggests that regular caffeine intake of up to 400 mg per day, or approximately 8 cups of green tea, is not associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (38018, 38076, 91028, 91034, 97451, 97453), atherosclerosis (38033), cardiac ectopy (91127), stroke (37804), ventricular arrhythmia (95948, 97453), and cardiovascular disease in general (37805, 98806).\n\nCombining ephedra with caffeine can increase the risk of adverse effects. Jitteriness, hypertension, seizures, and temporary loss of consciousness has been associated with the combined use of ephedra and caffeine (2729). There is also a report of ischemic stroke in an athlete who consumed ephedra 40-60 mg, creatine monohydrate 6 grams, caffeine 400-600 mg, and a variety of other supplements daily for 6 weeks (1275). In theory, combining caffeinated green tea with ephedra would have similar effects.\n\nIn a case report, the EGCG component of a specific weight loss supplement (Hydroxycut) was thought to be responsible for atrial fibrillation (54028). The patient was given two doses of intravenous diltiazem and was loaded with intravenous digoxin. Thirty-six hours after the last product dose, she spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm. The authors suggested that the block of the atrial-specific KCNA5 potassium channel likely played a role in this response.\n\nA case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported for a patient who consumed a weight loss product containing green tea (53978). She presented at the emergency department with a one-week history of malaise, fatigue, and petechiae of the skin. Twelve procedures of plasmapheresis were performed, and corticosteroid treatment was initiated. She was discharged after 20 days.\nless\nDermatologic\nOrally, green tea may cause skin rashes or skin irritation (53731, 54038, 90161, 90187, 102716). Topically, green tea may cause local skin reactions or skin irritation, erythema, burning, itching, edema, and erosion (53731, 54018, 97136, 104609, 111031). A green tea extract ointment applied to the cervix can cause cervical and vaginal inflammation, vaginal irritation, and vulval burning (11310, 36442, 36438). When applied to external genital or perianal warts, a specific green tea extract ointment (Veregen, Bradley Pharmaceuticals) providing 15% kunecatechins can cause erythema, pruritus, local pain, discomfort and burning, ulceration, induration, edema, and vesicular rash (15067, 53907).\nless\nEndocrine\nThere is some concern that, due to its caffeine content, green tea may be associated with an increased risk of fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer, and endometriosis. However, this is controversial since findings are conflicting (8043). Restricting caffeine in females with fibrocystic breast conditions doesn't seem to affect breast nodularity, swelling, or pain (8996).\n\nA population analysis of the Women's Health Initiative observational study has found no association between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages, such as green tea, and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors (108806). Also, a dose-response analysis of 2 low-quality observational studies has found that high consumption of caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (108807).\n\nA case of hypoglycemia has been reported for a clinical trial participant with type 2 diabetes who used green tea in combination with prescribed antidiabetes medication (54035).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, green tea beverage or supplements can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and pain, constipation, dyspepsia, reflux, morning anorexia, increased thirst, flatulence, and diarrhea. These effects are more common with higher doses of green tea or green tea extract, equivalent to 5-6 liters of tea per day (8117, 11366, 36398, 53719, 53867, 53936, 54038, 54076, 90139, 90140)(90161, 90175, 90187, 97131, 97136, 102716).\nless\nHepatic\nThere is concern that some green tea products, especially green tea extracts, can cause hepatotoxicity in some patients. In 2017, the regulatory agency Health Canada re-issued a warning to consumers about this concern. The updated warning advises patients taking green tea extracts, especially those with liver disease, to watch for signs of liver toxicity. It also urges children to avoid taking products containing green tea extracts (94897). In 2020, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) formed an expert panel to review concerns of green tea extract-related hepatotoxicity. Based on their findings, USP determined that any products claiming compliance with USP quality standards for green tea extract must include a specific warning on the label stating \"Do not take on an empty stomach. Take with food. Do not use if you have a liver problem and discontinue use and consult a healthcare practitioner if you develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)\" (102722).\n\nNumerous case reports of hepatotoxicity, primarily linked to green tea extract products taken in pill form, have been published. A minimum of 29 cases have been deemed at least probably related to green tea and 38 have been deemed possibly related. In addition, elevated liver enzymes have been reported in clinical research (14136, 15026, 53740, 53746, 53775, 53859, 54027, 90139, 90162, 90164)(93256, 94898, 94899, 102716, 102720, 102722, 107158, 111020, 111644). Most cases of toxicity have had an acute hepatitis-like presentation with a hepatocellular-elevation of liver enzymes and some cholestasis. Onset of hepatotoxic symptoms usually occurs within 3 months after initiation of the green tea extract supplement, and symptoms can persist from 10 days to 1 year (95439, 94897, 94898, 107158). Some reports of hepatotoxicity have been associated with consumption of green tea-containing beverages as well (15026, 53742, 54016, 90125, 90143).\n\nIn most cases, liver function returned to normal after discontinuation of the green tea product (14136, 15026, 53859, 93256, 107158). In one case, use of a specific ethanolic green tea extract (Exolise, Arkopharma) resulted in hepatotoxicity requiring a liver transplant. Due to concerns about hepatotoxicity, this specific extract was removed from the market by the manufacturer (14310). Since then, at least 5 cases of liver toxicity necessitating liver transplantation have been reported for patients who used green tea extracts (94898, 107158).\n\nThere are also case reports of hepatotoxicity in green tea combined with other ingredients. In one case, use of green tea (Applied Nutrition Green Tea Fat Burner) in combination with whey protein, a nutritional supplement (GNC Mega Men Sport), and prickly pear cactus resulted in acute liver failure (90162). Whether the hepatotoxicity in these cases is related to green tea, the other products, or their combination is unclear.\n\nDespite the numerous reports of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of green tea products, the actual number of hepatotoxicity cases is low when the prevalence of green tea use is considered. From 2006 to 2016, liver injury from green tea products was estimated have occurred in only 1 out of 2.7 million patients who used green tea products (94897, 95440).\n\nIn addition to the fact that green tea hepatotoxicity is uncommon, it is also not clear which patients are most likely to experience liver injury (94897, 95440). The hepatotoxicity does not appear to be an allergic reaction or an autoimmune reaction (94897). It is possible that certain extraction processes, for example, ethanolic extracts, produce hepatotoxic constituents. However, in most cases, the presence of contaminants in green tea products has not been confirmed in laboratory analyses (90162).\n\nAlthough results from one analysis of 4 small clinical studies disagrees (94899), most analyses of clinical data, including one conducted by the European Food Safety Association, found that hepatotoxicity from green tea products is associated with the dose of EGCG in the green tea product. Results show that daily intake of EGCG in amounts greater than or equal to 800 mg per day is associated with a higher incidence of elevated liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT) (95440, 95696, 97131). However, it is still unclear what maximum daily dose of EGCG will not increase liver enzyme levels or what minimum daily dose of EGCG begins to cause liver injury. In many cases of liver injury, the dose of green tea extract and/or EGCG is not known. Therefore, a minimum level of green tea extract or EGCG that would cause liver injury in humans cannot be determined (102722). Keep in mind that daily intake of green tea infusions provides only 90-300 mg of EGCG daily. So for a majority of people, green tea infusions are likely safe and unlikely to cause liver injury (95696). Also, plasma levels of EGCG are increased when green tea catechins are taken in the fasting state, suggesting that green tea extract should be taken with food (102722).\n\nUntil more is known, advise patients that green tea products, especially those containing green tea extract, might cause liver damage. However, let them know that the risk is uncommon, and it is not clear which products are most likely to cause the adverse effect or which patients are most likely to be affected. Advise patients with liver disease to consult their healthcare provider before taking products with green tea extract and to notify their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of liver damage, including jaundice, dark urine, sweating, or abdominal pain (102722).\nless\nImmunologic\nOrally, matcha tea has resulted in at least one case of anaphylaxis related to green tea proteins. A 9-year-old male experienced systemic redness and hives, nausea, and anaphylaxis 60 minutes after consuming matcha tea-flavored ice cream (107169). The caffeine found in green tea can also cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals, although true IgE-mediated caffeine allergy seems to be relatively rare (11315).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nOrally, the ingestion of the green tea constituent epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or a decaffeinated green tea polyphenol mixture may cause mild muscle pain (36398).\n\nThere is some concern regarding the association between caffeinated green tea products and osteoporosis. Epidemiological evidence regarding the relationship between caffeinated beverages such as green tea and the risk for osteoporosis is contradictory. Caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium (2669, 10202, 11317). Females with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to be at an increased risk for the detrimental effect of caffeine on bone mass (2669). However, moderate caffeine intake of less than 400 mg per day, or about 8 cups of green tea, doesn't seem to significantly increase osteoporosis risk in most postmenopausal adults with normal calcium intake (2669, 6025, 10202, 11317).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, green tea can cause central nervous system stimulation and adverse effects such as headache, anxiety, dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, agitation, tremors, restlessness, and confusion. These effects are more common with higher doses of green tea or green tea extract, equivalent to 5-6 liters of tea per day (8117, 11366, 53719, 90139, 102716). The green tea constituent epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or decaffeinated green tea may also cause mild dizziness and headache (36398).\n\nCombining ephedra with caffeine can increase the risk of adverse effects. Jitteriness, hypertension, seizures, temporary loss of consciousness, and hospitalization requiring life support has been associated with the combined use of ephedra and caffeine (2729).\n\nTopically, green tea extract (Polyphenon E ointment) may cause headache when applied to the genital area (36442).\nless\nPsychiatric\nGreen tea contains a significant amount of caffeine. Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, and psychological dependence (11832). The existence or clinical importance of caffeine withdrawal is controversial. Some researchers think that if it exists, it appears to be of little clinical significance (11839). Other researchers suggest symptoms such as headache; tiredness and fatigue; decreased energy, alertness, and attentiveness; drowsiness; decreased contentedness; depressed mood; difficulty concentrating; irritability; and lack of clear-headedness are typical of caffeine withdrawal (13738). Withdrawal symptoms such as delirium, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea, nervousness, restlessness, anxiety, muscle tension, muscle pains, and flushed face have been described. However, these symptoms may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects. Clinically significant symptoms caused by caffeine withdrawal may be uncommon (2723, 11839).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nA case of granulomatous alveolitis with lymph follicles has been reported for a 67-year-old female who used green tea infusions to wash her nasal cavities for 15 years (54088). Her symptoms disappeared 2 months after stopping this practice and following an undetermined course of corticosteroids. In a case report, hypersensitivity pneumonitis was associated with inhalation of catechin-rich green tea extracts (54025). Occupational exposure to green tea dust can cause sensitization, which may include nasal and asthmatic symptoms (11365).\nless\nRenal\nThere are two cases of hypokalemia associated with drinking approximately 8 cups daily of green tea in an elderly couple of Asian descent. The hypokalemia improved after reducing their intake by 50%. It is possible that this was related to the caffeine in the green tea (98418).\nless\nOther\nOrally, intake of a specific green tea extract product (Polyphenon E) may cause weight gain (90139).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nLIKELY EFFECTIVE\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV). A specific green tea extract ointment (Polyphenon E ointment 15%) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating external genital warts caused by HPV.\nA specific green tea extract ointment (Veregen, Bradley Pharmaceuticals; Polyphenon E ointment 15%, MediGene AG) providing 150 mg of sinecatechins per gram of ointment, applied three times daily to external warts, completely clears external genital and perianal warts in 24% to 60% of patients after 10-16 weeks of treatment (15067, 36438, 36442, 53777, 53907, 54018). This green tea extract is an FDA-approved prescription product (15067).\nless\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nCardiovascular disease (CVD). Drinking green tea seems to reduce the risk of CVD and CVD-related mortality.\nLarge-scale population research in Japan suggests that consuming at least 3-5 cups of green tea daily is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily. This association appears to be primarily related to a decrease in risk for cerebral infarction and heart disease. This association appears to be stronger in females than in males (14498, 53789, 100202). Population research also suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of CVD. One meta-analysis suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a 28% reduced risk of CAD (54017). Another meta-analysis suggests that consuming small to moderate amounts of green tea, 1-5 cups or 300 to 1500 mL daily, is associated with an 8% to 16% reduced risk of coronary heart disease over 5 to 13 years when compared with consuming no green tea (111017). One meta-analysis suggests that a 1 cup increase in green tea consumption is associated with a 5% reduced risk of CVD mortality and a 3% reduced risk of CVD events (102728). When compared with drinking less than 1 cup of green tea daily, epidemiological research in a population at high risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) suggests that drinking more than 3 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 46% reduced odds of having CAD, especially severe CAD, as determined by a coronary angiography (104588). A sub-group analysis suggests that these odds only occurred in individuals consuming fruits more than 4 times weekly and not in individuals consuming fruits less often (104588). However, some population research suggests that any association seems to be greater for males than females (53691). Other population studies suggest that general tea consumption might protect against ischemic heart disease or death from CVD; however, many of the tea drinkers in some of these studies consumed black tea rather than green tea (8119, 8120, 8121, 102728).\nless\nEndometrial cancer. Drinking green tea seems to be beneficial for endometrial cancer prevention.\nMeta-analyses of epidemiological research have found that people who drink green tea often, usually more than once daily, have a 21% to 23% reduced risk of developing endometrial cancer when compared with those who never or rarely drink green tea (53919, 92409, 102716). One of these meta-analyses also found that increasing green tea intake by one cup per day is associated with an 11% reduced risk of developing endometrial cancer (92409).\nless\nHyperlipidemia. Oral green tea seems to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by a small amount.\nClinical research and a meta-analysis of clinical research in people with or without hyperlipidemia shows that consuming green tea or green tea extract containing 150-2500 mg catechins daily for up to 24 weeks reduces total cholesterol by about 5-24 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by about 2-25 mg/dL when compared with control (11308, 54038, 54048, 90146, 90161, 97135, 104605). There is also preliminary evidence that taking a green tea extract containing catechins 676 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces oxidation of LDL cholesterol when compared with placebo, which might lead to reduced damage to the vascular endothelium and reduced arteriosclerosis (98458). Epidemiological research has found that higher consumption of green tea, especially 10 cups daily or more, is associated with improved serum lipids in males, but not females (6403, 97134).\nless\nOvarian cancer. Drinking green tea seems to be beneficial for ovarian cancer prevention.\nConsuming tea, including green tea or black tea, appears to significantly lower the risk of developing ovarian cancer when compared with never or seldom consuming tea (9228, 13208, 90144, 102716). One meta-analysis of population research suggests that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 36% reduced risk of ovarian cancer when compared with the lowest intake (102716). Also, one prospective population study found that those who consume 2 or more cups of tea daily have a 46% lower risk of ovarian cancer when compared with those who don't regularly consume tea (13208). There also appears to be a trend that suggests higher consumption of tea or longer duration of use further reduces the risk of ovarian cancer (9228, 13208). However, green tea does not appear to prevent ovarian cancer recurrence. Preliminary clinical research shows that drinking 500 mL of double-brewed green tea (DBGT), prepared with 35 grams/L of tea leaves standardized to contain approximately 640 mg/L of EGCG, daily for up to 18 months does not prevent cancer recurrence in adults with a history of advanced stage serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer (90175).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAcne. Topical green tea might reduce acne lesions by a small amount. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for acne.\nA meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research shows that topical application of green tea extract reduces the number of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions by a small amount (104609). In one small study, applying a solution containing the green tea constituent epigallocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 1% or 5% twice daily for 8 weeks was used (54074). However, oral green tea extract had limited or no effect in one study included in a meta-analysis (104609). Higher quality studies are needed to confirm this finding.\nless\nAge-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for cognitive decline associated with age.\nIn elderly individuals living in the community, clinical research shows that taking matcha green tea powder (Yabukita, Kyoeiseicha Co., Ltd.) 3 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve overall measures of cognitive function when compared with placebo. However, a sub-group analysis in females found a small improvement in language, but not other measures, including memory, impulsivity, and attention (104602). Other clinical research in middle aged and older adults shows that taking green tea extract (Thea-Flan 90S, ITO EN Ltd.) providing catechins 336.4 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve most measures of cognitive function, although there was a small effect on one measure of working memory. In addition, a single dose has a small effect on errors during an attention task (104603).\nless\nAmyloidosis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for amyloidosis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis shows that drinking green tea (Green Darjeeling, FTGFOP1, Teekampagne Projektwerkstatt GmbH) 1.5-2 liters standardized to contain epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 340 mg/L and/or taking specific capsules (Praevent-loges, Dr. Loges + Co. GmbH) containing 300 mg green tea extract standardized to contain EGCG 75 mg/capsule for 12 months protects against an increase in left ventricular wall thickness and left ventricular myocardial mass (54064).\nless\nAnxiety. Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for anxiety, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition.\nAthletic performance. The evidence on the effects of green tea constituents for athletic performance is conflicting.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea extract containing up to 572.8 mg of catechins as a beverage does not improve respiration efficiency, maximal oxygen uptake, or time trial performance in individuals undergoing endurance training when compared with beverages without catechins (53987, 53991). However, other preliminary research shows that taking specific pills (Teavigo, Healthy Origins) containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 135 mg/pill, taken three times daily with meals for a total dose of seven pills, improves maximal oxygen uptake but not maximum work rate or respiration efficiency, in healthy adults when compared with placebo (53944). Also, a small study in untrained adults shows that taking a single dose of green tea polyphenols 640 mg, 90 minutes before exercise, increases maximal oxygen uptake. However, the effect on athletic performance was not determined (104606).\nless\nBeta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing iron accumulation in beta-thalassemia.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking green tea 3 cups daily after meals for 12 months, in addition to usual treatment with blood transfusions and deferasirox, an iron chelator, reduces levels of liver iron and serum ferritin by moderate amounts when compared with usual treatment alone. Hemoglobin values did not differ between groups. Each green tea bag contained 2 grams green tea (Lipton, Unilever Gulf) (104601).\nless\nBladder cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for bladder cancer prevention.\nSome epidemiological evidence suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer (1458, 1459, 90179). However, conflicting evidence exists. A meta-analysis of some epidemiological evidence suggests that drinking green tea is not associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer (54077, 90166, 102716).\nless\nBreast cancer. Evidence evaluating the association between green tea intake and breast cancer risk is inconsistent; any association may be dependent on genotype and menopausal status.\nMeta-analyses of cohort and case-control studies have found that green tea intake is not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (98460, 102716). However, some individual population studies suggests that green tea intake is associated with a reduced odds of developing breast cancer in Asian-American (14427, 53866), but not Asian (13189, 14426, 90181), populations. Any protective effect of green tea on breast cancer risk might depend on patient genotype or menopausal status. Green tea consumption does not seem to lower breast cancer risk in Asian females with low-activity angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype, although it does seem to decrease breast cancer risk in Asian females with high-activity ACE genotype (14430). Similarly, Asian-American females who drink green tea seem to have a lower breast cancer risk if they have low-activity catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype. However, they do not seem to benefit if they do not have the low-activity COMT genotype (14431). Additionally, some observational research suggests that there is a link between green tea and modestly reduced breast cancer risk in pre-menopausal, but not postmenopausal, females (99788).\n\nSome research has evaluated the effect of green tea on breast cancer recurrence. Population research suggests that Asian females who have had stage I or II breast cancer who drink at least 3 cups of green tea daily seem to have reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence (3926, 13189, 54112). However, drinking green tea does not seem to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence of later-stage breast cancer.\n\nIn April 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming green tea may reduce the risk of breast cancer, although the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence to support this claim (102106).\nless\nCervical cancer. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for cervical cancer.\nClinical research in adults with persistent high-risk HPV (HR HPV) infection and concomitant low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia shows that taking a specific green tea extract (Polyphenon E), four capsules standardized to contain epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 200 mg/capsule, once daily for 4 months does not affect HR HPV-positive status or histological outcomes when compared with placebo (90145).\nless\nCervical dysplasia. It is unclear if topical green tea is beneficial for cervical dysplasia.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific ointment (Polyphenon E ointment 15%, MediGene AG) containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to human papilloma virus (HPV)-infected cervical lesions twice weekly and/or taking a specific green tea extract (Polyphenon E) 200 mg daily containing EGCG by mouth for 8-12 weeks can improve lesion appearance when compared with control (11310).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if drinking green tea reduces the risk of COPD.\nOne prospective, observational study in older adults has found that consumption of at least 3 cups daily of tea, including green tea, oolong tea, and black tea, is associated with a 23% reduction in COPD prevalence and a 65% reduced risk of developing COPD in models adjusted for potential confounders when compared with the lowest tea consumption (107201). However, green tea was only consumed by about 19% of the population included in this study and consumption of green tea itself was not associated with a reduced risk of COPD.\nless\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral green tea improves cognitive function in healthy adults.\nA small clinical study in adults ages 50-69 years shows that taking matcha powder (Hojin no shiro, Ito En, Ltd.) 9 capsules daily for 12 weeks, providing 170 mg total catechins daily, modestly improves some measures of attention and work performance when compared with taking placebo or caffeine. However, there was no effect on other measures of these outcomes, or on verbal memory tasks, visual information processing, working memory, motor function, or facial expression recognition (107168). Another small clinical study shows that taking a single dose of the green tea constituent, epigallocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG), 135 or 270 mg does not seem to improve mood or cognitive performance in healthy adults (54059).\n\nGreen tea has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that consuming a multi-ingredient beverage containing green tea powder 50 mg, elderberry extract, carob extract, and guarana seed extract improves some measures of cognitive function such as rapid visual information processing and multitasking, but not others, 120 minutes later when compared with placebo (113940). It is unclear if this effect is due to green tea, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of mild cognitive impairment in elderly adults.\nSome population research in elderly individuals has found that drinking green tea at least once per week is associated with a 53% reduced incidence of dementia or mild cognitive impairment when compared to not consuming green tea (104598). In addition, drinking at least two cups of green tea daily was associated with a 54% lower prevalence of cognitive impairment (104611).\n\nA clinical study in adults with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline shows that taking oral matcha green tea powder capsules 2 grams daily for 12 months does not improve activities of daily living scores or measures of cognitive function compared with placebo (116753).\n\nGreen tea has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Some clinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product containing green tea extract 360 mg/capsule and L-theanine 60 mg/capsule (LGNC-07, LG Household & Health Care, Ltd) twice daily after meals for 16 weeks improves memory and attention in patients with mild cognitive impairment when compared with placebo (54019). It is unclear if this effect is due to green tea, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nColorectal adenoma. It is unclear if oral green tea extract is beneficial for reducing colorectal adenoma recurrence.\nA large clinical trial in patients with previously removed colorectal adenomas shows that taking green tea extract (Dr. Loges + Co. GmbH) standardized to epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 150 mg twice daily for 3 years does not affect the risk of developing new metachronous adenomas when compared with taking placebo (111020). However, a sub-group analysis shows that taking green tea extract results in a 10% absolute reduction in risk of adenoma formation in males, but not females (111020). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with previously removed colorectal adenomas shows that taking green tea extract 1.5 grams daily for 12 months reduces the incidence of metachronous adenomas when compared with placebo (53816).\nless\nColorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention.\nAlthough evidence from individual population studies is mixed (9222, 9223, 14498, 90176, 90178, 90181, 102718), meta-analyses of population research suggest that a high intake of green tea is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (36416, 102716). The highest intake of green tea is associated with a 16% reduced risk when compared with the lowest; however, the benefit appears to be specific to colon cancer, not rectal cancer (102716). When subdivided according to gender, evidence from case-control research suggests that green tea is associated with a reduced risk of colon and rectal cancer for females (54096).\nless\nCommon cold. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for the common cold.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific formulation (ImmuneGuard, Nutraceutical Holdings LLC) containing L-theanine (Suntheanine, Taiyo International) plus epigallocatechin gallate (Sunphenon, Taiyo International) twice daily for 3 months reduces cold or flu symptoms and duration of symptoms when compared with placebo in healthy adults (53754).\nless\nCrohn disease. Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for Crohn disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition.\nDementia. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for dementia prevention.\nA meta-analysis of observational studies in over 20,000 adults suggests that the risk of any cognitive deficit (including mild cognitive impairment and dementia) is associated with a 6% reduction per cup of green tea consumed daily (107829). Some population research in elderly individuals suggests that drinking green tea at least once per week is associated with a 53% reduced incidence of dementia or mild cognitive impairment when compared to not consuming green tea (104598). Other population research in adults ages 40-74 years suggests that drinking at least 600 mL of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia when compared with drinking less than 60 mL daily. However, there is a modest reduction in dementia risk specifically in individuals ages 60-69 years (107164). A prospective, observational study suggests that consumption of tea, including both green and black tea, of at least 4 cups, in conjunction with 0.5-1 cups of coffee, daily is associated with a 30% reduced risk of dementia when compared with not drinking tea or coffee. Also, drinking 2-3 cups daily of both tea and coffee is associated with a 28% reduced risk of dementia when compared with not drinking tea and coffee (107204). Any association between drinking green tea specifically and developing dementia cannot be determined from this study.\nless\nDental plaque. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for reducing dental plaque.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that use of oral or topical products containing green tea modestly reduces dental plaque when compared with control products, including triclosan toothpaste, placebo, and chlorhexidine rinse. However, a sub-group analysis shows that a green tea rinse is no more effective than a chlorhexidine rinse. Green tea products in these studies included mouth rinse, paste, tea, capsules, and strips (107156). Many of these studies are limited by a lack of clear blinding. A more recent clinical study in children ages 10-14 years with plaque and gingivitis shows that using a mouthwash containing green tea extract 5% twice daily, alone or at half strength with ginger extract, for 30 days reduces plaque and gingivitis severity. The mouthwash containing the combination of green tea and ginger extract was most effective, and the green tea extract alone was at least as effective as chlorhexidine (107163).\nless\nDepression. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for depression prevention.\nEpidemiological research suggests that consuming green tea is associated with a reduced prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms. In Japanese adults, drinking four or more cups of green tea daily is associated with a 44% to 51% lower prevalence of mild to severe depression when compared to consuming one cup or less daily (90160, 90163). A meta-analysis suggests that the highest green tea consumption is associated with a 34% reduced risk of depressive symptoms when compared with the lowest (111024). Other research in a general population of Chinese adults suggests that consuming at least 1 cup of green tea daily is associated with a 22% decreased risk of depressive symptoms over 2 years when compared with almost never consuming green tea. However, there is no association between depressive symptoms and less frequent green tea consumption in this population (111023).\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if drinking green tea or taking green tea extract is beneficial for the prevention of diabetes or the improvement of glycemic control.\nEpidemiological research has found that Japanese adults who consume 6 or more cups of green tea daily have a 33% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to those who consume one cup or less daily. The risk reduction appears to be more pronounced in females when compared with males (14313). Also, epidemiological research has found that Chinese adults who consume at least one cup of green tea per week have a 59% to 77% lower risk of impaired fasting glucose when compared to those who consume less than one cup per week (90149). Other epidemiological research has found that consumption of any amount of green tea daily by Chinese adults is associated with an 8% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with never drinking green tea (107165). In contrast, some epidemiological research in Chinese adults has found that green tea consumption is associated with a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with non-green tea drinkers. A dose-response relationship was found for both the amount and duration of tea consumed (107170). Also, clinical research in patients with prediabetes shows that drinking one cup of green tea three times daily for 14 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared to control (90174).\n\nThere is inconsistent evidence regarding the effects of green tea in patients with type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological research suggests that drinking at least 4 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 40% reduction in mortality risk when compared to not drinking green tea (104589). Other epidemiological research in patients with type 2 diabetes has found that consumption of any amount of green tea daily is associated with a 10% reduction in mortality risk when compared to never drinking green tea. However, there was no association between green tea intake and the incidence of developing macrovascular or microvascular complications (107165).\n\nMeta-analyses of clinical research show that green tea extract and green tea catechins reduce fasting blood glucose when compared to control when patients with type 2 diabetes, borderline diabetes, or normal blood glucose status are evaluated together (90154, 90187). However, a meta-analysis of up to 15 mainly small clinical trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking green tea does not affect fasting blood glucose or insulin or improve insulin resistance or glucose control when compared with placebo. Most included studies used green tea or its extract in doses of 400-10,000 mg daily for 8-16 weeks (104604). Also, clinical research shows that taking green tea extract daily for up to 16 weeks does not improve blood glucose, HbA1c, or insulin when compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes or borderline diabetes (37678, 37781, 54035).\n\nSome research has evaluated the effect of green tea on other outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. One meta-analysis shows that taking green tea extract modestly reduces fasting triglyceride levels when compared with control. This benefit was seen with doses of at least 800 mg daily taken for longer than 8 weeks. This dose and duration reduces levels of total cholesterol, but not low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (102715). Another meta-analysis shows that taking green tea modestly reduces body weight, body mass index (BM), and body fat. A sub-analysis shows that these benefits occur in studies lasting more than 8 weeks, using doses of up to 800 mg daily, and in patients who were overweight. There was no effect on waist circumference. Most patients included in the analysis were overweight or had obesity (104610).\nless\nDiabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for improving diabetic neuropathy symptoms.\nClinical research in patients with mild-to-moderate diabetic peripheral neuropathy shows that taking decaffeinated green tea extract 500 mg three times daily for 16 weeks modestly reduces neural pain and dysfunction, as well as overall symptom severity, when compared with placebo (107159).\nless\nDown syndrome. It is unclear if oral green tea is able to alter facial morphology in children with Down syndrome.\nA small case series has found that taking green tea extract daily, starting during the first 3 years of life, is associated with reduced facial dysmorphology in six of seven children with Down syndrome. There was no effect in children aged 4-18 years (107167). This study is limited by its observational design. The dosage, time of onset, and duration of treatment differed between individuals.\nless\nDry eye. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for improving dry eye symptoms.\nIn patients with mild to moderate dry eye and meibomian gland dysfunction, preliminary clinical research shows that applying green tea extract into the eyes three times daily for one month, in addition to artificial tears three times daily, improves symptoms of dry eye. Symptoms of itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and redness were improved by a moderate amount over artificial tears alone (104612).\nless\nDysmenorrhea. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for preventing dysmenorrhea symptoms.\nPopulation research has found that drinking green tea is associated with a 37% reduced odds of experiencing dysmenorrhea and a 58% reduced odds of having moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhea when compared with not drinking green tea (102729).\nless\nEsophageal cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for preventing esophageal cancer; the available research is conflicting.\nAlthough some epidemiological evidence and observational studies have found that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of esophageal cancer, most meta-analyses do not support this finding in a mixed group of adults (1457, 36542, 90169, 90185, 90186, 102004, 102716, 107154). Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies suggest that drinking green tea is associated with a 54% reduction in the risk of esophageal cancer, or a 21% reduced odds per cup of green tea consumed daily, only in females (90169, 90185, 102004, 107154). Also, some epidemiological research found that drinking green tea that is very hot is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer (53828). In addition, drinking decaffeinated green tea 5 mg daily for 12 months does not seem to be an effective treatment for patients diagnosed with esophageal precancerous lesions (53702).\nless\nFractures. It is unclear if drinking green tea reduces fracture risk.\nPopulation research has found that consumption of green tea is associated with a 12% lower risk of any fracture and 20% lower risk of hip fracture when compared with no tea consumption (99800).\nless\nGastric cancer. Evidence evaluating an association between green tea consumption and gastric cancer risk is conflicting.\nMost meta-analyses of epidemiological studies suggest that green tea consumption is not associated with gastric cancer risk (53767, 53813, 90181, 102716). Although the most recent meta-analysis of epidemiological research suggests that drinking green tea regularly is associated with up to a 9% reduced risk of gastric cancer when compared with non-regular consumption, sub-analyses suggest that there is no association between gastric cancer and intake of specific amounts of green tea up to at least 3 cups daily (111025). Also, other population research suggests that drinking 10 or more cups of green tea daily is associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer (8903, 9222, 9225, 9226, 9227), while consuming less than 10 cups daily is not consistently associated with a reduced risk (7033, 9223, 54090). The association between drinking green tea and gastric cancer-related mortality has also been investigated, A large-scale population study in Japan suggests that drinking 5 or more cups of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer-related mortality when compared to drinking less than one cup daily (14498). Discrepancies might be related to the temperature of the green tea. The most recent meta-analysis suggests that intake of cold or warm green tea, and not hot green tea, is associated with a modest reduction in gastric cancer risk (111025).\nless\nGingivitis. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for gingivitis.\nA meta-analysis of clinical research shows that use of oral or topical products containing green tea modestly reduces gingivitis and gingival bleeding when compared with control products, including triclosan toothpaste, placebo, and chlorhexidine rinse. However, a sub-group analysis shows that a green tea rinse is no more effective than a chlorhexidine rinse. Green tea products used in these studies were heterogeneous and included mouth rinse, gel, paste, tea, strips, and capsules (107156). Many of these studies are limited by a lack of clear blinding. A more recent clinical study in children ages 10-14 years with plaque and gingivitis shows that using a mouthwash containing green tea extract 5% twice daily, alone or at half-strength with ginger extract, for 30 days reduces plaque and gingivitis severity. The mouthwash containing the combination of green tea and ginger extract was most effective, and the green tea extract alone was at least as effective as chlorhexidine (107163).\nless\nHeadache. Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition.\nHypertension. The evidence is mixed as to whether drinking green tea reduces the risk of hypertension and whether oral green tea lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertension.\nSome epidemiological research from China shows that drinking 120-599 mL of green tea or oolong tea daily is associated with a 46% lower risk of developing hypertension when compared with non-habitual tea drinkers; drinking more than 600 mL daily is associated with a 65% reduced risk (12518). In contrast, drinking green tea daily is associated with a 38% increased odds of having hypertension when compared with never drinking green tea in elderly Chinese males, but not females (107166).\n\nGreen tea may help lower blood pressure in patients with or without hypertension; however, the evidence is mixed, and any reductions appear to be small. A meta-analysis of two clinical trials in patients with hypertension shows that drinking green tea for 4-16 weeks reduces systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure by about 6 mmHg (104583). Meta-analyses in patients with or without hypertension, including overweight or obese adults, suggest that green tea reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 1-3 mmHg (90146, 90155, 90161, 98423, 102726, 111018). Some studies used green tea, made by boiling a 3 gram tea bag with 150 mL water and then waiting for 5 minutes and consuming three times daily approximately 2 hours after each meal for 4 weeks (90159), or green tea extract up to 1500 mg daily for up to 12 weeks (111018), including a specific product (Olimp Labs) 379 mg, taken daily with the morning meal for 3 months (54068).\nless\nHypotension. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for postprandial hypotension in elderly adults.\nSome research shows that consuming caffeinated beverages increases blood pressure in elderly people with postprandial hypotension (11834, 11835). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that drinking 400 mL of green tea before lunch increases postprandial systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 15 mmHg and 6 mmHg, respectively, in older elderly people with postprandial hypotension (89482).\nless\nInfertility. Oral green tea has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research in females with a history of problems conceiving shows that taking three capsules daily of a proprietary blend of Vitex agnus-castus extract (standardized to 0.5% agnusides), green tea extract (standardized to 50% phenols), L-arginine, vitamins E, B6, and B12, folate, iron, magnesium, zinc, and selenium (FertilityBlend, The Daily Wellness Company) for three menstrual cycles increases the rate of pregnancy at three months by 61% when compared with placebo (41479).\nless\nInfluenza. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing the flu.\nA meta-analysis of five clinical trials in individuals with or without prior influenza vaccination shows that use of green tea catechins, either in capsule form or as a gargled liquid, reduces the rate of influenza infections by 33% when compared with control. Also, a meta-analysis of observational research has found that gargling with or consuming green tea containing catechins is associated with a 48% reduced risk of influenza when compared with not taking green tea catechins. More information is needed to compare the efficacy of the different forms of green tea catechins (107152). Some epidemiological research not included in this meta-analysis has found that drinking at least 5 cups of green tea weekly is associated with a 32% reduced odds of developing confirmed influenza when compared with drinking less than one cup weekly. A sub-group analysis suggests that this association is only evident in individuals who had not received the influenza vaccination (104608). Conversely, other preliminary research shows that gargling with green tea at least three times daily for 90 days does not prevent influenza in high school students when compared with water (90150).\n\nGreen tea has also been evaluated in combination with theanine. One small study shows that taking a combination of green tea catechins (THEA-FLAN 90S, Ito-en Co) 378 mg standardized to 270 mg of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) with theanine 210 mg daily for 5 months reduces the risk of developing clinically defined influenza, but not laboratory-confirmed influenza infection, when compared with placebo (54021). Other preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking two capsules of a specific formulation (ImmuneGuard, Nutraceutical Holdings LLC) containing L-theanine (Suntheanine, Taiyo International) plus EGCG (Sunphenon, Taiyo International) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of subjects with cold or flu symptoms and the number of days with symptoms when compared with placebo (53754).\nless\nJapanese cedar pollinosis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing Japanese cedar pollinosis symptoms.\nIn patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis, clinical research shows that drinking Benifuuki green tea drink 350 mL containing O-methylated catechin 34-40 mg daily beginning 6-10 weeks before pollen exposure until the end of pollen season can reduce nasal and ocular symptoms. Clinical research compared the \"benifuuki\" drink enriched in O-methylated EGCG with that of another green tea \"yabukita,\" containing no O-methylated EGCG (53884, 90156).\nless\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if drinking green tea prevents kidney stones.\nPopulation research suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of having kidney stones. This risk was 22% lower in males and 16% lower in females when compared with never or former green tea drinkers (104613).\nless\nLeukemia. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for leukemia prevention.\nAlthough some large epidemiological studies suggest that drinking green tea reduces the risk of leukemia by 51% to 80% (53799, 90183, 102723), a meta-analysis of generally low-quality population research shows a variable association between green tea intake and risk of leukemia (102716).\nless\nLiver cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for liver cancer prevention.\nTwo meta-analyses of epidemiological research suggest that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer (97132, 111016). The most recent meta-analysis in approximately 1.5 million adults in Asia, North America, and Europe suggests that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 20% reduced risk of liver cancer when compared with the lowest. The most benefit was associated with consumption of at least 4 cups daily (111016). Another meta-analysis that included studies conducted in Japan, China, or Singapore suggests that higher green tea consumption is associated with a 12% reduced incidence of liver cancer when compared with the lowest consumption of green tea. However, the benefit appears to be limited to females; green tea consumption was not associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer in males (97132). A large epidemiological study in Chinese females also suggests that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer. Consuming a cumulative intake of 30 kg dried green tea leaves is associated with a 46% reduced risk of primary liver cancer over a median of 18 years when compared with never drinking green tea (111030). In contrast, some individual epidemiological studies suggest that green tea consumption is not associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer in Japanese individuals (90181, 102716).\nless\nLung cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for lung cancer prevention.\nIndividual observational studies and meta-analyses of population research have yielded conflicting evidence about the effects of green tea on lung cancer risk (13190, 14498, 53829, 90177, 102716). Although one meta-analysis of population research suggests that the highest intake of green tea does not reduce lung cancer risk when compared to the lowest intakes (102716), other analyses suggest that increasing green tea consumption by two cups daily is associated with an 18% decreased risk of lung cancer, and that drinking 7-10 cups of green tea daily is associated with an 18% to 33% reduced risk of lung cancer when compared with drinking less than one cup daily (53829, 90177).\nless\nMental alertness. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for mental alertness.\nGreen tea contains caffeine. Consumption of caffeinated beverages seems to prevent a decline in alertness and cognitive capacity when consumed throughout the day (4221, 4224). Also, combining caffeine with glucose as an \"energy drink\" seems to improve mental performance better than placebo or either caffeine or glucose alone (13732). However, there is mixed evidence regarding the effects of green tea on mental alertness.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for improving metabolic parameters in people with this condition.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea extract 1000 mg daily or drinking four cups of green tea daily for 8 weeks does not improve metabolic syndrome features, including waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, or blood sugar in obese patients with metabolic syndrome when compared to control (53995).\nless\nMultiple myeloma. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for multiple myeloma prevention.\nPopulation research suggests that drinking at least 5 cups of green tea each day is not associated with a reduced risk of multiple myeloma when compared with never drinking green tea (102723).\nless\nMyocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if drinking green tea prevents MI or if drinking green tea prevents mortality in patients with a previous MI.\nWhen compared with drinking less than one cup of green tea daily, epidemiological research in a population at high risk of coronary artery disease has found that drinking more than three cups of green tea daily is associated with a 49% reduced odds of having a past MI as determined by a coronary angiography. A sub-group analysis found that these odds only occurred in individuals consuming both fruits and vegetables more than four times weekly and not in individuals consuming fruits or vegetables less often (104588). In addition, observational research has found that drinking either 1-3 cups or at least 4 cups of green tea daily is associated with 19% and 32% lower odds of MI, respectively, when compared to drinking less than 1 cup daily (97134).\n\nIn patients with a previous MI, drinking at least 7 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 53% reduced odds of all-cause mortality over a median of 18.5 years when compared with not drinking green tea (107160).\nless\nNasopharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for nasopharyngeal cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 51% reduced risk of nasopharyngeal cancer when compared with the lowest intake (102716).\nless\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for NAFLD.\nClinical research shows that drinking green tea 700 mL containing 1080 mg of catechins daily for 12 weeks does not affect body weight or body mass index (BMI), but does reduce body fat percentage from 34% to 32%, when compared with drinking either green tea 700 mL containing 200 mg of catechins or a control tea. Also, the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio increased by 11% when compared with baseline (90168). Meta-analyses of four studies in patients with NAFLD show that taking green tea extract 500-1000 mg daily or green tea catechins 600 mg daily improves liver function tests when compared with placebo (98459, 102720). One meta-analysis also shows that these doses improve BMI, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (98459).\nless\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for non-Hodgkin lymphoma prevention.\nPopulation research has found that drinking at least 3.5 cups of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma when compared with never drinking or drinking less than 1 cup of green tea daily (102005, 102723).\nless\nObesity. Evidence for the use of green tea products for weight loss is conflicting. The conflicting findings may be related to the caffeine and catechin content of the studied products, as well as the physical activity level of the individual.\nMany clinical studies show that drinking green tea or taking green tea extract that contains caffeine (about 70-200 mg) and high levels of catechins (about 576-886 mg) daily for 12-24 weeks modestly improves weight loss when compared to control in overweight individuals or patients with obesity (8114, 37725, 53906, 90184). A meta-analysis of 25 randomized clinical trials shows that taking green tea extract containing caffeine results in an additional weight loss of 1.8 kg when compared with a control group not taking green tea extract (102719). In addition, a meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that taking green tea reduces body weight by 0.4 kg in mainly overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes (104610). Some research also shows that drinking green tea or taking green tea extract containing high levels of catechins but no caffeine reduces weight and visceral fat in overweight individuals or patients with obesity when used for up to 12 weeks (53994, 54039, 90184). In these clinical trials, the following doses have been used: two capsules of green tea extract daily standardized to containing 870 mg of catechins (460 mg EGCG) or 4 cups of green tea daily standardized to contain 928 mg of catechins (440 mg EGCG) for 8 weeks (53994); a specific decaffeinated green tea extract (Sunphenon 90LB, Taiyo Kagaku Ltd.) 530 mg twice daily for 6 weeks (54039); catechin-enriched green tea beverages providing 234-886 mg of catechins once or twice daily for approximately 3 months (37705, 53906, 90184); a specific green tea extract (AR25, Exolise, Arkopharma), taken as four capsules standardized to contain 375 mg of catechins (epigallocatechin gallate 270 mg) in two divided doses daily for 12 weeks (8114).\n\nSome research has also shown weight loss benefits of multi-ingredient products or diets containing green tea. Multi-ingredient products have included an herbal mixture of garcinia extract 650 mg, green tea extract 100 mg, coffee extract 75 mg, and banaba extract 25 mg per tablet (IQP-GC-101, InQpharm Europe Ltd.) 30 minutes before meals twice daily for 12 weeks (90137) and a specific product (Sanavita Industry, Piracicaba) containing powdered green tea (40 mg of caffeine), orange pulp, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium, taken as 20 grams in two divided doses daily for 8 weeks (90134). Drinking green tea has also been used as part of a Mediterranean diet also including Wolffia globose (109888).\n\nHowever, many studies show conflicting results (37715, 37753, 54035, 98419, 98420, 98422). Reasons for these inconsistent findings are not entirely clear, but may relate to the use of decaffeinated green tea products, the use of green tea products containing low catechin amounts, or the presence and type of concomitant exercise.\n\nSome research shows that green tea extract containing a lower catechin amount (491 mg daily) or decaffeinated green tea products do not improve weight loss when compared with placebo in patients with obesity (37753, 54035, 98419). One meta-analysis of 15 clinical studies including about 1240 patients with obesity shows that using green tea products that are decaffeinated does not improve body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference when compared with control, while green tea products containing catechins 576-714 mg daily and caffeine do improve these outcomes (16892). Taking green tea after weight loss does not seem to improve weight maintenance when compared with control (14428, 54076).\n\nOther clinical research shows that green tea does not improve weight loss in individuals with obesity who are already participating in exercise, such as walking and interval sprinting (37715, 98420). In contrast, another small clinical study shows that taking green tea 500 mg daily for 10 weeks while participating in HIIT improves weight, body fat percentage, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with either green tea or HIIT alone. However, it appears that the majority of these improvements are due to participation in HIIT (100201).\n\nThere is also some limited research in children. One small clinical trial in obese children ages 6-16 years shows that taking green tea providing 576 mg catechins daily for 24 weeks modestly reduces waist circumference, as well as systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, when compared with taking green tea providing 75 mg catechins daily. However, there were no significant difference between groups for other anthropometric measures or cardiovascular risk factors (37743). Another clinical trial in obese females ages 6-10 years who were also given diet and exercise advice shows that taking decaffeinated green tea polyphenols 400 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fat mass, but does not affect other anthropometric measures, when compared with placebo. Also, taking green tea polyphenols modestly reduces ovary volume, but has no effect on other measures of early puberty, such as breast development, uterine volume, or levels of sex hormones (107162).\nless\nOral cancer. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for oral cancer prevention.\nMeta-analyses of epidemiological research suggest that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 20% to 29% reduction in risk of oral cancer when compared with the lowest intake (90180, 102716). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with high-risk oral premalignant lesions shows that taking a green tea extract 500-1000 mg/m2 three times daily after meals for 12 weeks increases the rate of clinical and histological response when compared with placebo (53936).\nless\nOral leukoplakia. It is unclear if drinking green tea and concomitantly applying topical green tea to lesions is beneficial for oral leukoplakia.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with oral leukoplakia shows that drinking 3 grams of a mixed tea product containing green tea daily for 6 months, while also topically applying a 10% mixed tea product in the mouth three times daily, reduces oral lesion size by about 38%, compared with a 3% increase in those taking placebo. It is not clear if this effect is due to green tea, the other ingredients, or the combination (4213).\nless\nOsteopenia. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing osteopenia.\nPopulation research suggests that drinking green tea for 10 years is associated with increased bone mineral density (8116). Other population research suggests that drinking less than one cup of green tea daily is associated with an 81% to 85% increased odds of having osteopenia when compared with drinking green tea 1-3 times daily (111026). Preliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults with osteopenia shows that taking capsules containing green tea polyphenols 500 mg (233 mg as epigallocatechin-3-gallate or EGCG) daily, possibly while practicing tai chi 60 minutes three times weekly, for 24 weeks improves serum markers of bone turnover and muscle strength when compared to baseline (54040). However, the results from this study are limited by a lack of control group and the fact that diagnostic measures of bone health, such as T-score or Z-score, were not assessed.\nless\nOsteoporosis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing osteoporosis.\nPopulation research suggests that drinking green tea for 10 years is associated with increased bone mineral density (8116). Other population research suggests that drinking less than one cup of green tea daily is associated with up to a 91% increased odds of having osteoporosis when compared with drinking green tea 1-3 times daily (111026). More recent clinical research shows that taking decaffeinated green tea extract supplying approximately 1315 mg of catechins (843 mg as EGCG) daily does not improve bone mineral density, T-score, or Z-score in postmenopausal adults (98419).\nless\nOverall mortality. Some population research suggests that drinking green tea may reduce the risk of overall mortality by a small amount.\nA meta-analysis of population research in Japanese adults found that drinking at least 5 cups of green tea daily is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily (102002). Another meta-analysis of population research found that each one cup per day increase in green tea consumption is associated with a 3% reduced risk of all-cause mortality (102728). However, more recent population research has found that although drinking green tea is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality in patients with a previous MI and stroke, drinking as much as 7 cups of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced odds of all-cause mortality over a median of 18.5 years in individuals with no history of stroke or MI when compared with not drinking green tea (107160).\nless\nPancreatic cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for pancreatic cancer prevention.\nA meta-analysis of population research suggests that the highest intake of green tea is not associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer when compared with the lowest intake (102716). However, one epidemiological study suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (54096).\nless\nParkinson disease. Although consuming caffeinated beverages might reduce the risk of developing Parkinson disease, it is unclear if oral green tea prevents or improves symptoms in people with this condition.\nThere is some evidence from large-scale epidemiological studies that the incidence of Parkinson disease decreases with increased consumption of caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and cola. For men, the effects seem to be dose related. Men consuming a total of 421-2716 mg of caffeine (approximately 5-33 cups of tea) from any source daily seem to have the greatest reduction in risk. However, there seems to be a significant reduction in risk even with consumption of as little as 124-208 mg caffeine daily (approximately one to three cups tea) (6022). In females, the effects do not seem to be dose related. Moderate consumption of approximately 1-4 cups daily seems to provide the most reduction in risk (1238). It is unclear if consuming green tea is more or less effective than other caffeinated beverages for reducing Parkinson disease risk.\nless\nPeriodontitis. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for improving oral health or improving periodontal disease.\nEpidemiological research has found that intake of green tea is inversely associated with symptoms of periodontal disease, including probing depth, attachment loss, and bleeding on probing (53844). A small clinical trial shows that taking green tea extract 1.55% by weight in chewable candy for 28 days appears to reduce plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation (7594). A small clinical trial in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that applying a gel containing green tea extract 1 gram/100 mL into the periodontal pocket as an adjunct to scaling improves gingivitis, periodontal disease, and clinical attachment by 7%, 112%, and 116%, respectively, when compared with placebo gel (90135). A meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research also shows that use of oral or topical products containing green tea modestly improve clinical attachment when compared with control products, including triclosan toothpaste and placebo. Green tea products included gel, paste, and tea (107156).\nless\nPneumonia. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for pneumonia prevention.\nEpidemiological research in Japanese females has found that consuming green tea is associated with a lower risk of death from pneumonia when compared to those who do not drink green tea (53897). However, other epidemiological research in hospitalized elderly Japanese adults has found that there is no association between green tea consumption during the past month and prevalence of pneumonia at time of hospitalization (107161).\nless\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for PCOS.\nA meta-analysis of 4 small clinical trials shows that taking green tea modestly reduces weight in patients with PCOS when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on other endpoints including body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, or waist or hip circumference. Three studies in the meta-analysis used green tea 1000-2000 mg/daily in tablets or capsules; the other study used green tea powder providing epigallocatechin gallate 1620 mg daily (111019). However, the included studies were small and utilized heterogeneous dosing regimens. Subsequently, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking green tea leaf powder, 500 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 1500 mg daily for 3 months, improves menstrual cycle regularity, but does not reduce BMI or waist or hip circumference, when compared with metformin or placebo (114894).\nless\nPostoperative pain. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with green tea is beneficial for postoperative pain associated with molar removal.\nIn patients undergoing third molar extraction, a small clinical trial shows that using 15 mL of a mouthwash containing green tea extract 5 grams/100 mL twice daily, beginning the day after surgical removal of impacted molars and continuing for 7 days thereafter, reduces pain by 60% and analgesic use during the first three days when compared with using a mouthwash that does not contain green tea (90141).\nless\nProstate cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea or taking green tea catechins by mouth is beneficial for prostate cancer treatment or prevention.\nGreen tea catechins have been evaluated for reducing prostate cancer risk in high-risk patients (14127, 98421, 102716). A meta-analysis of results from three clinical trials shows that taking green tea catechins 400-600 mg daily for 12-30 months reduces the risk of prostate cancer by approximately 62% when compared with placebo in high-risk patients (98421). However, another meta-analysis including two of these studies plus one additional does not show that taking green tea catechins reduces the incidence of prostate cancer in high-risk patients (102716). Most population research has found that drinking higher amounts of green tea is not associated with a reduced risk for prostate cancer when compared with those who never or rarely drink green tea (14128, 54036, 53741, 53753, 90153, 90181, 98421). However, one meta-analysis of population research found that people who drink very high amounts of green tea (7-15 cups daily) have a 19% to 44% reduced risk of prostate cancer (98421). Another population study found that higher green tea intake is associated with a reduced risk of advanced, but not overall, prostate cancer risk (53753). In April 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming green tea may reduce the risk of prostate cancer, although the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence to support this claim (102106).\n\nAdditionally, most clinical research shows that drinking large amounts of green tea or taking green tea extract does not reduce disease progression in patients with prostate cancer (11366, 53726).\n\nGreen tea and green tea catechins have also been evaluated for reducing prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with or at risk of prostate cancer shows that taking green tea or green tea extract for 3 weeks to 12 months does not modify PSA levels when compared with water or placebo. However, sub-analyses suggest that there is significant heterogeneity with respect to findings between geographical locations, with some evidence of benefit in studies conducted in the US (107155).\nless\nRadiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical green tea is beneficial for preventing radiation dermatitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients undergoing radiotherapy after breast cancer surgery shows that spraying epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) over the radiation field prevents the development of at least moderate severity radiation dermatitis by 30% when compared with saline as placebo. Also, occurrence of symptoms was delayed by about 2.7 days and symptom severity was reduced. EGCG 660 mcmol/L was sprayed 3 times daily from the first day of radiation until 2 weeks after completion at 0.05 mL per squared cm (111031). The interpretation of these results is limited by the unbalanced treatment groups.\nless\nRadiation-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing diarrhea associated with radiotherapy.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking a green tea tablet (Camgreen, Iran Giahessence Pharmacy Co.) 450 mg daily for 5 weeks during pelvic irradiation reduces the frequency of diarrhea in patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment. In the fifth week of treatment, 19% of patients taking green tea had diarrhea, compared with approximately 62% of those taking placebo (104614).\nless\nRadiation-induced nausea and vomiting. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing vomiting associated with radiotherapy.\nA small clinical trial shows that taking a green tea tablet (Camgreen, Iran Giahessence Pharmacy Co.) 450 mg daily for 5 weeks during pelvic irradiation does not reduce the frequency of vomiting when compared with placebo in patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment (104614).\nless\nRenal cell carcinoma. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing kidney cancer.\nEpidemiological research suggests that green tea intake is not associated with risk of kidney cancer over a mean of 19 years in Japanese adults. However, in females, consuming at least 5 cups of green tea daily, but not lesser amounts, is associated with a 55% reduced risk of kidney cancer when compared with rare intake (111022).\nless\nSkin cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral or topical green tea for skin cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition.\nStress. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for stress reduction.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific brand of green tea extract (Teavigo, DSM) 300 mg orally for 7 days reduces stress and increases calmness when compared with placebo in healthy individuals (54055).\nless\nStretch marks (striae distensae). It is unclear if topical green tea is beneficial for stretch marks.\nA small clinical study in young adult females shows that applying a green tea extract 3% cream to stretch marks on the leg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces stretch mark severity when compared to baseline (114893). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a control group.\nless\nStroke. It is unclear if consumption of green tea is associated with a reduced risk of stroke or with reduced all-cause mortality in patients with a previous stroke.\nLarge-scale population research in Japanese individuals suggests that consuming at least 3-5 cups of green tea daily is associated with a reduced risk of cerebrovascular mortality when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily. This association appears to be primarily related to a decrease in risk for cerebral infarction or hemorrhage (14498, 54080, 102002). Other population research suggests that drinking 1-3 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 36% reduced odds of stroke when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily, while drinking 4 or more cups daily has no effect. Also, green tea consumption was not associated with reduced incidence of cerebral hemorrhage or infarction in this study (97134). Meta-analyses of population research suggest that an increase of 1 cup per day in green tea consumption is associated with a 6% reduced risk of stroke or cerebral hemorrhage (102728, 111021).\n\nA prospective, observational study also suggests that higher intake of tea, including green and black tea, of at least 2 cups daily is associated with a 16% reduced risk of stroke when compared with not drinking tea. This study also found that drinking 2-3 cups daily of each tea and coffee is associated with a 38% reduced risk of stroke when compared with not drinking tea and coffee. The combination of 0.5-1 cups of coffee and 2-3 cups of tea daily, but not tea alone, was associated with a 50% reduced risk of post-stroke dementia when compared with not drinking tea and coffee (107204).\n\nIn patients with a previous stroke, drinking at least 3 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 48% to 62% reduced odds of all-cause mortality over a median of 18.5 years when compared with not drinking green tea (107160).\nless\nSunburn. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for preventing ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema.\nA meta-analysis of three small clinical trials shows that taking green tea catechins 540-1402 mg daily for 6 to 12 weeks has a small to moderate protective effect against ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema when compared with placebo, especially at lower doses of ultraviolet radiation. A single topical dose of green tea ingredients may also be beneficial, but data is limited (107153).\nless\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for SLE.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea extract 500 mg (containing 22% polyphenols) twice daily for 3 months modestly improves disease activity, general health, and vitality when compared with placebo (97136).\nless\nTinea pedis. It is unclear if a topical green tea footbath is beneficial for athlete's foot.\nIn bedridden, elderly patients with cognitive deficiency, use of a footbath containing a 0.1% green tea extract for 15 minutes once daily for 12 weeks does not improve symptoms of athlete's foot, but does improve skin condition, when compared with a footbath not containing green tea. The green tea extract Sunphenon BG-3 (Taiyo Kagaku Co. Ltd., Yokkaichi), prepared by dissolving 5 grams of the Sunphenon BG-3 product in 5 liters of water to create a 0.1% green tea solution, was used (90151).\nless\nTooth extraction. Topical green tea has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small, split-mouth clinical study in patients undergoing third molar extractions shows that applying a gel containing green tea extract 0.5% and hyaluronic acid into the surgical site immediately after extraction and three times daily for 7 days improves some post-operative outcomes, such as reducing exudate or facial edema when compared with placebo (114895). It is unclear if these effects are due to green tea, hyaluronic acid, or the combination.\nless\nUlcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for ulcerative colitis.\nPreliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis shows that taking a specific green tea product (Polyphenon E, Mitsui-Norin) 200 mg or 400 mg twice daily for 8 weeks may increase the number of people who respond to therapy and achieve remission when compared with placebo. After treatment, 10 of 15 patients in the green tea extract group responded to therapy and 8 of 15 patients achieved remission, compared with 0 in the placebo group (90140).\nless\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if gargling and swallowing green tea is beneficial for reducing URTI symptoms.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that gargling and swallowing green tea (Morgentau, Ronnefeld KG) 100 mL daily over 4 days is less effective than proprietary labdanum lozenges (CYSTUS052, Dr Pandalis Urheimische Medizin GmbH & Co.) for upper respiratory tract symptoms in patients with URTIs (53867).\nless\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing UTI symptoms.\nA small clinical study in females with acute uncomplicated cystitis shows that adding green tea 2000 mg daily for 3 days to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole reduces symptoms of cystitis when compared with placebo (99799). This study is limited by its small size and the lack of information on antibiotic resistance in each treatment group.\nless\nWrinkled skin. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for wrinkles.\nSome preliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea catechins 175 mg twice daily for two years does not reduce signs of photo-aging of the skin in females with facial photo-aging when compared with placebo (53873). However, using a combination of topical green tea 10% cream and oral green tea extract 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks seems to improve skin elasticity in females with moderate photo-aging based on microscopic analysis, although the clinical appearance of the skin does not seem to significantly improve (53731). Other preliminary clinical research shows that consuming one liter of a beverage with green tea polyphenols for 12 weeks improves skin elasticity, roughness, and hydration in middle-aged females when compared with placebo (54030).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate green tea for these uses.",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGreen tea has most often been used as a beverage, a powder, or an extract. Doses of green tea generally provide up to 2500 mg catechins or 700 mg of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) daily. Isolated catechins have also been used. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nGreen tea extract and beverages are often standardized to total catechin or EGCG content. Green tea beverages are typically standardized to contain 178-823 mg of total catechins per cup (53987, 53994, 53995, 54030, 90156, 90168, 90174, 90175, 90184). Green tea extracts are typically standardized to contain about 85% to 95% or 400-450 mg of total catechins per capsule (53994, 53995, 54035, 54039, 90139, 90140, 90145). They are also sometimes standardized to 15% to 97% EGCG (54039, 54055, 90137, 90145, 90158).\n\nWhile rare, some research suggests that green tea extracts are associated with hepatotoxicity. To minimize this risk, green tea extracts should be taken with food (102722).\n\nDrinking green tea may reduce the absorption of iron from plant foods (631, 8110, 9237, 111644). While this interaction is unlikely to be clinically meaningful in most individuals, advise patients with low iron stores to separate intake of green tea from meals.\n\nAdditionally, certain foods may reduce the absorption of active green tea constituents. Some clinical evidence suggests that consuming green tea extract in conjunction with soy protein reduces catechin bioavailability (90957). Advise patients to separate dosing of green tea and soy protein products by at least 3 hours. There is also some concern that milk may reduce the absorption of green tea polyphenols (220, 6032, 15219, 36557, 36594). However, this interaction is unlikely to be clinically significant.\nTopical:\nTopically, green tea has been used in a solution, footbath, ointment, or gel. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nChildren\nResearch is limited; typical dosing is unavailable.\nStandardization & Formulation\nVarious green tea products and extracts have been examined in clinical trials. Green tea, green tea beverages, and green tea extracts are typically standardized to polyphenol or total catechin content. The commonly used dose of green tea, which is about 3 cups per day, provides 240-480 mg of polyphenols (53867). Green teas used in clinical research have been standardized to contain 178-823 mg of total catechins per cup (53994, 53995, 90156, 90168, 90174, 90184). Green tea-containing beverages used in clinical research have been standardized to contain about 400 mg of total catechins per cup of green tea beverage (53987, 54030), or 302 mg of EGCG per cup (90175).\n\nSupplements containing green tea extract have been standardized to contain about 400-450 mg of total catechins per capsule (53994, 53995, 54035, 54039). One product contained 187.5 mg polyphenols, 125 mg EGCG, and 20 mg caffeine per 250 mg extract (98420).\n\nA specific decaffeinated green tea extract supplement (Teavigo, DSM) has been standardized to contain 94% to 97% EGCG (54055, 90158).\n\nA green tea footbath used in a clinical trial was made using a specific green tea extract Sunphenon BG-3 (Taiyo Kagaku Co. Ltd.), which was standardized to a total catechin content 89.1% with an EGCG content of 48.8% and an epigallocatechin (EGC) content of 17.8%. The footbath was prepared by dissolving 5 grams of Sunphenon BG-3 in 15 mL glycerin, then diluting the solution in 5 liters of water to create a 0.1% green tea solution (90151).\n\nA specific green tea extract (Polyphenon E), has been used in various clinical trials (90139, 90140, 90145). Polyphenon E contains 85% to 95% total catechins, with 56% to 72% as EGCG. Capsules are standardized to contain 200 mg of EGCG per capsule (90145).\n\nA specific product (Herbal One Green Tea Extract, Herbal One Co., Ltd.) containing 250 mg of green tea extract per capsule has been standardized to contain gallic acid 0.24 mg, catechin 4.09 mg, caffeine 28.86 mg, EGCG 33.58 mg, and epicatechin gallate 9.28 mg (37725).\n\nA specific decaffeinated green tea extract product (Sunphenon 90LB, Taiyo Kagaku Ltd) containing decaffeinated green tea extract 530 mg per capsule has been standardized to contain EGCG 40.71%, epigallocatechin (EGC) 16.27%, epicatechin 8.74%, epicatechin gallate 6.02%, gallocatechin 2.02%, gallocatechin gallate 1.27%, catechin 1.16%, gallic acid 0.75%, and catechin gallate 0.03% (54039).\n\nOne type of green tea extract (Thea-Flan 90S, ITO EN Ltd.) provided catechin 336.4 mg and caffeine 2.7 mg per three capsules. The catechins included EGCG 216.9 mg, epicatechin gallate 96.4 mg, epigallocatechin 3.2 mg, epicatechin 1.7 mg, gallocatechin gallate 12.5 mg, catechin gallate 4.0 mg, gallocatechin 1.0 mg, and catechin 0.8 mg (104603).",

Caffeine is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine at the cellular level. However, caffeine doesn't seem to affect supplemental adenosine because high interstitial levels of adenosine overcome the antagonistic effects of caffeine (11771). It is recommended that methylxanthines and methylxanthine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing (11771).\nless\nALCOHOL (Ethanol)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, alcohol might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nGreen tea contains caffeine.

Green tea contains small amounts of vitamin K, approximately 7 mcg per cup (100524). Some case reports have associated the antagonism of warfarin with the vitamin K content of green tea (1460, 1461, 1463, 4211, 6048, 8028, 20868). However, these reports are rare, and very large doses of green tea (about 8-16 cups daily) appear to be needed to cause these effects. Furthermore, the catechins and caffeine in green tea are reported to have antiplatelet activity (733, 8028, 8029, 12882, 100524).\nless\nANTIDIABETES DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, taking green tea with antidiabetes drugs might interfere with blood glucose control.\nConcomitant use of green tea and antidiabetes drugs might interfere with blood glucose control. The data are conflicting. Reports claim that green tea and/or caffeine, a constituent of green tea, might increase or decrease blood sugar (6024, 8646, 54011, 54035, 54068, 90154).\nless\nATORVASTATIN (Lipitor)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGreen tea extract seems to reduce the levels and clinical effects of atorvastatin.\nIn healthy humans, taking green tea extract 300 mg or 600 mg along with atorvastatin reduces plasma levels of atorvastatin by approximately 24%. The elimination of atorvastatin is not affected (102714). Atorvastatin is a substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs). Research shows that two of the major catechins found in green tea, epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), inhibit OATPs. Some OATPs are expressed in the small intestine and are responsible for the uptake of drugs and other compounds, which may have resulted in reduced plasma levels of atorvastatin (19079). It is not clear if drinking green tea alters the absorption of atorvastatin.\nless\nBETA-ADRENERGIC AGONISTS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nGreen tea contains caffeine.

This prevents the induction of cell death in multiple myeloma or glioblastoma cancer cell lines (17212). Advise patients taking bortezomib, not to take green tea.\nless\nCARBAMAZEPINE (Tegretol)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of carbamazepine and increase the risk for convulsions.\nGreen tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that taking caffeine can lower the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine and can induce seizures when taken in doses above 400 mg/kg (23559, 23561). Human research has shown that taking caffeine 300 mg in three divided doses along with carbamazepine 200 mg reduces the bioavailability of carbamazepine by 32% and prolongs the plasma half-life of carbamazepine 2-fold in healthy individuals (23562).\nless\nCELIPROLOL (Celicard)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, green tea might reduce the levels and clinical effects of celiprolol.\nIn a small human study, taking green tea daily for 4 days appears to decrease blood and urine levels of celiprolol by at least 98% (104607). This interaction is possibly due to the inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP). Green tea catechins have been shown to inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP), one of which, OATP1A2, is found in the intestine (19079, 19080, 98461) The interaction is thought to be due primarily to the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content of green tea (98461).\nless\nCIMETIDINE (Tagamet)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine in green tea.\nGreen tea contains caffeine. Cimetidine can reduce caffeine clearance by 31% to 42% (11736).\nless\nCLOZAPINE (Clozaril)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nTheoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of clozapine and acutely exacerbate psychotic symptoms.\nAnimal research suggests that, although green tea extract does not affect the elimination of clozapine, it delays the time to reach peak concentration and reduces the peak plasma levels (90173). Also, concomitant administration of green tea and clozapine might theoretically cause acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms due to the caffeine in green tea. Caffeine can increase the effects and toxicity of clozapine. Caffeine doses of 400-1000 mg daily inhibit clozapine metabolism (5051). Clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Researchers speculate that caffeine might inhibit CYP1A2. However, there is no reliable evidence that caffeine affects CYP1A2. There is also speculation that genetic factors might make some patients be more sensitive to the interaction between clozapine and caffeine (13741).\nless\nCONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine found in green tea.\nGreen tea contains caffeine.

Caffeine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) (3941, 5051, 11741, 23557, 23573, 23580, 24958, 24959, 24960, 24962), (24964, 24965, 24967, 24968, 24969, 24971, 38081, 48603). Theoretically, drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 may decrease the clearance rate of caffeine from green tea and increase caffeine levels.\nless\nCYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nGreen tea is unlikely to produce clinically significant changes in the levels and clinical effects of CYP3A4 substrates.\nIn vitro and in vivo research suggests that green tea can inhibit intestinal CYP3A and induce hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes (20896, 53747, 53835, 90170). However, this effect is unlikely to be clinically significant, as green tea does not appear to affect CYP3A4 activity in humans (14429, 90170).\nless\nDIPYRIDAMOLE (Persantine)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, green tea might decrease the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole and interfere with its use prior to stress testing.\nGreen tea contains caffeine. Caffeine might inhibit dipyridamole-induced vasodilation (11770, 11772). It is recommended that methylxanthines and methylxanthine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770).

In excessive amounts, caffeine can reduce potassium levels due to stimulation of the sodium-potassium pump (23579, 37905, 37953, 38003, 38034). Diuretics can also cause lower potassium levels.\nless\nEPHEDRINE\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk for stimulant adverse effects.\nGreen tea contains caffeine.

Taking green tea extract with a dose of fexofenadine decreased bioavailability of fexofenadine by about 30%. In vitro, green tea inhibits the cellular accumulation of fexofenadine by inhibiting the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) drug transporter (111029). Research shows that two of the major catechins found in green tea, epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), inhibit OATPs, specifically OATP1A2, OATP1B1, and OATP2B1. In addition, green tea has been shown to reduce the absorption of some drugs that are OATP substrates (19079, 102714, 102730).\nless\nFLUCONAZOLE (Diflucan)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, fluconazole might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nGreen tea contains caffeine.

Compared to a control group, peak levels and area under the curve (AUC) of lisinopril were reduced by approximately 71% and 66%, respectively (104599). This may be due to inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) by green tea catechins (19079, 19080, 98461) The interaction is thought to be due primarily to the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content of green tea (98461).\nless\nLITHIUM\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, abrupt green tea withdrawal might increase the levels and adverse effects of lithium.\nGreen tea contains caffeine.

This effect has been attributed to the inhibition of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and induction of hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes by green tea constituents (20896). However, it is unlikely that this effect is clinically significant, as the dose used in animals was 50 times greater than what is commonly ingested by humans.\nless\nMONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS (MAOIs)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk of a hypertensive crisis.\nGreen tea contains caffeine. Caffeine has been shown to inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B in laboratory studies (37724, 37877, 37912, 38108). Concomitant intake of large amounts of caffeine with MAOIs might precipitate a hypertensive crisis (15). In a case report, a patient that consumed 10-12 cups of caffeinated coffee and took the MAOI tranylcypromine presented with severe hypertension (91086). Hypertension was resolved after the patient switched to drinking decaffeinated coffee.\nless\nNADOLOL (Corgard)\nInteraction Rating\nMAJOR Do not take this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Lower quality RCT)\nGreen tea seems to reduce the levels and clinical effects of nadolol.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that green tea consumption reduces plasma concentrations of nadolol. Compared to a control group, both peak levels and total drug exposure (AUC) of nadolol were reduced by approximately 85% in subjects who drank green tea daily for two weeks. Drinking green tea with nadolol also significantly reduced nadolol's systolic blood pressure lowering effect (19071). Other clinical research shows that a single dose of green tea can affect plasma nadolol levels for at least one hour (102721). Green tea catechins have been shown to inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP), one of which, OATP1A2, is involved in the uptake of nadolol in the intestine (19071, 19079, 19080, 98461) The interaction is thought to be due primarily to the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content of green tea (98461).\nless\nNICARDIPINE (Cardene)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of nicardipine.\nGreen tea contains EGCG. Animal research shows that EGCG increases the area under the curve (AUC) and absolute oral bioavailability of nicardipine. The mechanism of action is thought to involve inhibition of both intestinal P-glycoprotein and hepatic cytochrome P450 3A (90136). The effect of green tea itself on nicardipine is unclear.\nless\nNICOTINE\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk of hypertension.\nGreen tea contains caffeine.

Taking green tea extract twice daily for 7 days 30 minutes prior to a meal along with nintedanib with the meal decreased the 12-hour area under the curve (AUC) values for nintedanib by 21%. There was no effect on the maximum concentration of nintedanib (111028).\nless\nORGANIC ANION-TRANSPORTING POLYPEPTIDE SUBSTRATES (OATP)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (In vitro or animal study)\nTheoretically, green tea might reduce the absorption of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) substrates.\nOATPs are expressed in the small intestine and liver and are responsible for the uptake of drugs and other compounds. Research shows that two of the major catechins found in green tea, epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), inhibit OATPs, specifically OATP1A2, OATP1B1, and OATP2B1. In addition, green tea has been shown to reduce the absorption of some drugs that are OATP substrates, including lisinopril, and celiprolol (19079, 102714, 102730).\nless\nP-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nGreen tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates.\nIn vitro research and case reports suggest that green tea inhibits drug efflux by P-gp, potentially increasing serum levels of P-gp substrates.

Animal research suggests that caffeine can modestly increase the maximum concentration, area under the curve, and half-life of pioglitazone, and also reduce its clearance. This increased the antidiabetic effects of pioglitazone (108812). However, the exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear.\nless\nQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, quinolone antibiotics might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nGreen tea contains caffeine.

Rosuvastatin is a substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, which is expressed in the liver. The increased plasma levels may have been related to inhibition of OATP1B1 (102717). However, in humans, taking EGCG with rosuvastatin reduced plasma levels of rosuvastatin, suggesting an inhibition of intestinal OATP (102730). It is not clear if drinking green tea alters the absorption of rosuvastatin.\nless\nSTIMULANT DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nMODERATE\nOccurrence\nPROBABLE\nLevel of Evidence\nC (Expert opinion)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase stimulant adverse effects.\nGreen tea contains caffeine.

Also, theoretically, concomitant use of verapamil and caffeinated beverages such as green tea might increase plasma caffeine concentrations and the risk of adverse effects, due to the caffeine contained in green tea. Verapamil increases plasma caffeine concentrations by 25% (11741).\nless\nWARFARIN (Coumadin)\nInteraction Rating\nMODERATE Be cautious with this combination.\nSeverity\nHIGH\nOccurrence\nUNLIKELY\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Anecdotal evidence)\nTheoretically, green tea may increase the risk of bleeding if used with warfarin.\nConflicting reports exist regarding the potential of green tea to antagonize the effect of warfarin; however, most evidence suggests that drinking green tea in moderation is unlikely to cause a significant interaction. Green tea contains a small amount of vitamin K, approximately 7 mcg per cup (100524). Some case reports have associated the antagonism of warfarin with the vitamin K content of green tea (1460, 1461, 1463, 4211, 6048, 8028, 20868). However, these reports are rare, and very large doses of green tea (about 8-16 cups daily) appear to be needed to cause these effects (1460, 1461, 1463, 8028). Therefore, use of green tea in moderate amounts is unlikely to antagonize the effects of warfarin; however, very large doses should be avoided.\nless",

Bitter orange in combination with caffeine or caffeine-containing herbs can increase blood pressure and heart rate in otherwise healthy normotensive adults, potentially increasing the risk of serious cardiovascular adverse effects (13657). However, in young mildly overweight individuals a combination product containing bitter orange, caffeine, and green tea does not seem to affect heart rate or blood pressure (20897).\nless\nCAFFEINE-CONTAINING HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS\nConcomitant use may increase the risk for adverse effects.\nUsing green tea with other products that contain caffeine can increase the risk for caffeine-related adverse effects.

There is some concern that combining caffeine, ephedra, and creatine might increase the risk of serious adverse effects. There is a report of ischemic stroke in an athlete who consumed creatine monohydrate 6 grams, caffeine 400-600 mg, ephedra 40-60 mg, and a variety of other supplements daily for 6 weeks (1275). Caffeine might also decrease creatine's possible beneficial effects on athletic performance. Some researchers think caffeine can inhibit phosphocreatine resynthesis (2117, 4575).\nless\nDANSHEN\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nGreen tea contains caffeine.

In healthy individuals, taking echinacea 400 mg daily for 8 days seems to inhibit the oral clearance of caffeine (23581). This effect seems to be due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, which is involved in caffeine metabolism.\nless\nEPHEDRA (Ma Huang)\nConcomitant use increases the risk for adverse stimulant effects.\nGreen tea contains caffeine. There is evidence that using ephedra with caffeine might increase the risk of serious life-threatening or debilitating adverse effects such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, seizures, and death (6486, 10307). Tell patients to avoid taking green tea with ephedra and other stimulants.\nless\nFOLIC ACID\nConcomitant use may reduce activity and bioavailability of supplementary folic acid.\nIn vitro, the green tea constuituent epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) appears to inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (15012). This enzyme is responsible for converting folic acid to its active form, tetrahydrofolate. In clinical pharmacokinetic research, low concentrations of green tea extracts appear to inhibit folic acid bioavailability (53782). Also, evidence from epidemiological research suggests that serum folate levels in pregnant adults with high consumption of green tea (57.3 mL per 1000 kcal) are decreased when compared to participants consuming average or low amounts of green tea (90171). Theoretically, green tea inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase could lead to a reduced conversion of folic acid to its active form.\nless\nGENISTEIN-CONTAINING HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS\nTheoretically, concomitant use may increase the risk of tumor growth, as well as the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nAnimal research suggests that using a combination of EGCG, a constituent of green tea, and genistein increases intestinal tumor growth (90188). Also, taking genistein 1 gram daily for 14 days seems to inhibit caffeine clearance and metabolism in healthy females (23582). This effect has been attributed to inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme, which is involved in caffeine metabolism.\nless\nHEPATOTOXIC HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk for hepatotoxicity.\nGreen tea extract supplements have been linked to several cases of hepatotoxicity (14136, 14310, 93256, 111644).

Infants given tea to drink seem to have an increased risk of microcytic anemia (631). However, a study of iron-deficient elderly patients suggests that concomitant use doesn't alter iron absorption in this population (185). Theoretically, green tea might reduce the absorption of iron supplements. For most patients, this effect will not be clinically significant.\nless\nKUDZU\nTheoretically, kudzu might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nGreen tea contains caffeine. Kudzu inhibits caffeine clearance and metabolism in healthy male individuals (23583).

Use with caution.\nless\nBLEEDING DISORDERS\nTaking green tea might aggravate bleeding disorders. Use with caution. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine is reported to have antiplatelet activity (8028, 8029), although this interaction has not been reported in humans (1701). Caffeine can prolong bleeding time and increase the results of a bleeding time test (1701).\nless\nCARDIAC CONDITIONS\nGreen tea contains caffeine, which might induce cardiac arrhythmias in sensitive individuals. Use with caution (11845). Caffeine has been reported to both increase and decrease heart rate, although this is not thought to be clinically significant at doses below 400 mg, or approximately 8 cups of green tea, daily (98806).\nless\nDIABETES\nGreen tea contains caffeine, which might interfere with glucose control in patients with diabetes. Use with caution. Some research suggests that caffeine may impair postprandial glucose metabolism in people with diabetes and contribute to insulin resistance. The effect of caffeinated beverages and herbs has not been studied (12374, 12375). Caffeine in green tea may enhance the frequency and intensity of hypoglycemic warning symptoms in people with type 1 diabetes. Theoretically, this may increase the ability of diabetic patients to detect and treat hypoglycemia early. However, it might also increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740). Caffeine has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose (8646).\nless\nDIARRHEA\nUse with caution in patients with diarrhea. Green tea contains caffeine, which can exacerbate diarrhea, especially when taken in large amounts.\nless\nEPILEPSY\nGreen tea contains caffeine. Some animal research indicates that high doses of caffeine can significantly reduce seizure threshold or induce seizures (23559, 23560, 23561). Furthermore, caffeine seems to decrease the activity of various anticonvulsant drugs, including carbamazepine, ethosuximide, felbamate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate (23558, 23559, 23560, 23561, 23562, 23563). However, caffeine does not seem to affect the anticonvulsant effects of lamotrigine, tiagabine, or oxcarbazepine (23561). Epileptic patients should avoid using high doses of caffeine or caffeine-containing products such as green tea; low doses of caffeine and caffeine-containing products should be used with caution.\nless\nGLAUCOMA\nUse with caution in patients with glaucoma. Green tea contains caffeine, which increases intraocular pressure within 30 minutes and persists for at least 90 minutes (8540).\nless\nHYPERTENSION\nUse with caution in patients with hypertension. Green tea with caffeine can temporarily increase blood pressure. However, increases are generally small and not clinically significant, being less than the normal diurnal variation in blood pressure (98806).

Green tea extract supplements have been linked to several cases of hepatotoxicity (14136, 14310, 15026, 53740, 53742, 53746, 53752, 53775, 54016, 54027)(93256, 102722, 111644).\nless\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nUse with caution in postmenopausal adults identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor. Green tea contains caffeine which can increase urinary excretion of calcium, although it usually remains within the normal range (98806). Some sources suggest that caffeine consumption should be limited to less than 300 mg daily (approximately 6 cups of green tea), unless there is adequate calcium supplementation to compensate for calcium losses (2669, 10202, 11317). However, according to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, healthy adults with adequate calcium intake are not at increased risk for decreased bone mineral density, osteoporosis, or fractures with daily caffeine intake equivalent to approximately 8 cups of green tea (11733, 98806). Postmenopausal adults with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to have an 8% higher risk for bone loss from caffeine (2669).\nless",

Caffeine can increase the linearity of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal that is used in most fMRI studies (23587).\nless\nNEUROBLASTOMA TESTS\nDue to its caffeine content, green tea might cause false-positive diagnosis of neuroblastoma when diagnosis is based on tests of urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) or catecholamine concentrations. Caffeine can increase urine catecholamine and VMA concentrations (15).\nless\nPHARMACOLOGICAL STRESS TESTS\nGreen tea contains caffeine which might interfere with pharmacological stress tests. Caffeine is a competitive antagonist for adenosine receptors and therefore may inhibit coronary vasodilation and compromise detection of ischemia (11771, 37784, 114659). It is recommended that caffeine and caffeine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, caffeine appears more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine (Adenocard) stress testing (11771). The interaction between caffeine and dipyridamole is unlikely to be significant in stress testing if the heart rate increase is greater than 5% after dipyridamole infusion (11772). Additionally, clinical research shows that caffeine 200 mg and 400 mg given 90 minutes before stress testing significantly impairs the ability of regadenoson, an adenosine receptor agonist, to detect existing ischemia (91083), while other research reported no effect with caffeine doses 80 mg or less consumed 1 hour prior to testing. Additionally, some clinical research suggests that any effect of caffeine on tests of left ventricular ejection fraction may be minimal (114659).\nless\nPHEOCHROMOCYTOMA TESTS\nTaking green tea might cause false-positive diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, when diagnosis is based on tests of urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) or catecholamine concentrations.

            "Overdose": "Presentation\nThere is concern that some green tea products, especially green tea extracts, can cause hepatotoxicity in some patients. However, the risk appears uncommon, and it is not clear which products are most likely to cause toxicity or which patients are most likely to be affected.\n\nIn 2017, Health Canada re-issued a warning to consumers about this concern. The updated warning advises patients taking green tea extracts, especially those with liver disease, to watch for signs of liver toxicity. It also urges children to avoid taking products containing green tea extracts (94897). In 2020, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) formed an expert panel to review concerns of green tea extract-related hepatotoxicity. Based on their findings, USP determined that any products claiming compliance with USP quality standards for green tea extract must include a specific warning on the label stating \"Do not take on an empty stomach. Take with food. Do not use if you have a liver problem and discontinue use and consult a healthcare practitioner if you develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)\" (102722).\n\nGreen tea contains caffeine. Large doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent sinus tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, ketosis, and death (11838, 13734, 13735).\nTreatment\nThere is insufficient reliable information available about the treatment of overdose with green tea.",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nIn human research, green tea or green tea extract has been shown to rapidly increase general levels of plasma polyphenols (36536, 54050, 54053, 90170), as well as levels of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and other individual catechins (36594, 53694, 53993, 53998, 54050, 54094, 102722). In one study, green tea consumption resulted in the appearance of epigallocatechin, EGCG, and epicatechin in plasma but epicatechin gallate was lacking (53998). When green tea extract is consumed along with nutrients such as ascorbic acid, selenium, N-acetyl cysteine, black grapes, and other nutrients, the systemic availability of EGCG is increased by 27% (53770). Also, absorption of green tea catechins is increased when tea polyphenols were given as a green tea supplement in capsule form, as opposed to a green tea drink (53722), or when administered as a phospholipid complex rather than as free catechins (54117). Taking green tea catechins in the fasting state increases plasma levels of EGCG. However, fasting does not appear to have a significant effect on the plasma levels of total (free and conjugated) epigallocatechin, and results in lower plasma levels of total epicatechin (53729, 102722). Taking green tea catechins with protein decreases bioavailability of the catechins (102722). Not all studies have found that green tea consumption increases blood levels of EGCG (8117).\n\nFollowing green tea consumption by humans the maximum plasma concentrations of EGCG, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin were 326 ng/mL, 550 ng/mL, and 190 ng/mL, respectively, and occurred 1.4-2.4 hours after ingestion (54110). Following ingestion of green tea extract in capsules, EGCG and epigallocatechin levels increased to 4410 pM/mL and 255 pM/mL, respectively, after 90 minutes (54104). Both studies suggested increased blood levels occurred with increasing doses of green tea only to a certain level before leveling off. When taken with a meal, decaffeinated green tea extract resulted in maximal blood levels of EGCG, epigallocatechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, and 4'-O-methyl EGCG of 1.09, 0.41, 0.33, 0.16, and 0.08 mcM, respectively, after 81.5-99.0 minutes (54024).\nDistribution\nIn human research, green tea ingestion resulted in the identification of 4'-O-methyl EGCG, EGCG, and epicatechin-3-gallate in prostatectomy tissue, at levels of 38.9 ± 19.5, 42.1 ± 32.4, and 17.8 ± 10.1 pmol/gram tissue, respectively (53996). Catechins accumulated in the protein-rich fraction of plasma (60%), in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (23%), and in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (36332).\nMetabolism\nIn human research, green tea ingestion resulted in the identification of methylated epigallocatechin and epicatechin in the urine; it was estimated that 50% to 60% of these catechins were methylated (53996). Also, green tea consumption resulted in urinary excretion of hippuric acid and 1,3-dihydroxyphenyl-2-O-sulfate, metabolites of catechins made by colonic bacteria (36424). In patients with the GG vs. AA genotype of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), green tea extract resulted in increased urinary methylated epigallocatechin in the first 5.5 hours (54065). As many as 39 flavan-3-ol catabolites were found following consumption of green tea (53962). In human research, oral intake of green tea catechins resulted in the incorporation of the metabolites benzoic acid, methylated gallic acid, and hydroxyphenyl-valerolactones, as well as intact catechins, in the skin (90167).\nExcretion\nIn human research, green tea ingestion resulted in increased polyphenols in the urine (90139). Flavan-3-ols in green tea are metabolized in a dose-dependent manner into 2 main phenyl-gamma-valerolactones (PVLs) accounting for 62% of the compounds excreted, a hydroxylated PVL with a sulfate conjugate and a hydroxylated PVL with a glucuronide conjugate (112247). Other metabolites excreted in urine following green tea consumption include hippuric acid, 1,3-dihydroxyphenyl-2-O-sulfate, microflora-derived polyhydroxyphenyl-gamma-valerolactones, 4-O-methylgallic acid, methylated epigallocatechin and epicatechin, and hydroxylated and unhydroxylated PVLs with sulfate and/or glucuronidate conjugates (6033, 36409, 36424, 53962, 53996, 112247). When compared with back tea, green tea consumption resulted in higher fecal and urinary excretions of polyphenols (36536).\n\nIn humans, the elimination half-life of EGCG is approximately 5 hours, with approximately 3 hours for epigallocatechin and epicatechin (54110, 90170). Total urinary EC and EGC exhibited greater than 90% excretion within 8 hours (54110). With increasing doses of almost pure EGCG, the elimination half-life increases, suggesting saturation of capacity-limited excretion routes (36408). After repeated days of green tea consumption, there is no urinary accumulation of PVLs, and urinary concentrations quickly return to negligible amounts after dietary exposure to flavanols is removed (112247).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of green tea are the leaf bud, leaf, and stem. Green tea is different than black and oolong teas because it is not fermented. Black tea is fully fermented, and oolong tea is partially fermented. Green tea is produced by steaming fresh leaves at high temperatures. This process inactivates certain oxidizing enzymes, but doesn't decrease polyphenols. Polyphenols such as flavanols, flavandiols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids are abundant in green tea. Flavanols, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epicatechin (EC), are all referred to as catechins. These seem to be responsible for many of the proposed benefits of green tea. EGCG makes up 50% to 60% of green tea catechins (6031, 8118, 11310, 90170, 90172, 102721). Flavonoids include kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin (90170). The amount of polyphenols and catechins in green tea is affected by growing conditions, leaf age, and storage during and after transport. Catechins in green tea range from 69 to 103 mg/gram of tea (14129, 14130). Green tea also contains phytoestrogens, including beta-sitosterol and the lignan precursors matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, as well as xanthenes (13190, 90170). Green tea also contains 2% to 4% caffeine (519) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup (4218). Another constituent of green tea leaves is the amino acid, L-theanine (90170, 90189). Unlike fermented teas such as black and oolong teas, green tea does not contain theaflavins, pigments that are produced during the fermentation process (15656).\nAnti-acne effects\nIn clinical research, topical application of green tea extract has been shown to have anti-acne effects. Possible mechanisms of action include antimicrobial effects against Propionibacterium acnes, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of its constituents (104609).\nAnti-arthritis effects\nAlthough evidence in humans is lacking, EGCG and other catechins in green tea might reduce inflammation and protect cartilage by inhibiting proteoglycan and collagen breakdown (12486). Green tea polyphenols seem to lessen joint degeneration in laboratory models of rheumatoid arthritis (12487). In vitro, in articular chondrocytes, EGCG decreased the production and activity of inflammatory cytokines and production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 (12485, 36387, 36392, 36402, 53868). Green tea catechins may also inhibit cartilage protein degradation in vitro (36377), as well as reduce the activity of inflammatory mediators in arthritic joints of animal models (12487).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nCatechins in green tea might have anti-inflammatory activity. Catechins derived from green tea are a laboratory standard for COX-1 inhibition (12849). Catechins from green tea also might inhibit the production of leukotriene-B4 and the activity of 5-lipoxygenase (12850). EGCG inhibits interleukin (IL)-1 beta-induced COX-2 and nitric oxide synthase activity (12485).\n\nEGCG and other catechins in green tea might also reduce inflammation and protect cartilage by inhibiting proteoglycan and collagen breakdown (12486). The anti-inflammatory activities of catechins may be due to their suppression of migration and suppressed activity of inflammatory cells, possibly in a manner related to cytokine inhibition as shown in vitro (53794, 53832) or by inhibiting proteins promoting chemotaxis of these cells (53941).\n\nIn human research, however, the effects of green tea or its constituents on inflammatory mediators are unclear. In some studies, the effects of green tea on all measured inflammatory mediators in the blood were lacking, including C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, IL-6, IL-1beta, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and leptin (53730, 53995). However, in other studies, green tea reduced levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, sVCAM-1, and/or CRP (53730, 54012, 54068, 104606). A meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that green tea increases IL-6 levels, decreases TNF-alpha levels, and does not affect CRP levels (102003).\nAnticancer effects\nGreen tea may protect against some kinds of cancer. Polyphenols in tea appear to have antimutagenic effects and may protect DNA (12523). In humans, green tea reduces DNA damage in lymphocytes, possibly by increasing the activity of the DNA repair enzyme human oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) and the antioxidant enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 (90148). Preliminary animal research suggests EGCG might prevent new blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) in tumors. EGCG may also inhibit tumor cell proliferation, causing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (1454, 1455, 1456, 8117, 11309, 15662, 36419, 54042). ECG appears to induce apoptosis in cancer cells by reactive oxygen species formation and mitochondrial depolarization (8118, 53937, 53971). Green tea may also reduce oxidative DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and free radical generation (4212). Green tea may also reduce mutagenic activity in smokers (4217, 53710, 53715, 54083).\n\nGreen tea is thought to be beneficial for preventing skin damage and cancer from ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to the antioxidant effects of polyphenols in green tea. In animal models of skin cancer, applying green tea polyphenols topically reduces progression of skin papillomas to squamous cell carcinoma (15066, 15068). Polyphenolic extracts of green tea, specifically EGCG and epicatechin-3-gallate, seem to produce dose-dependent topical protection against UVA and UVB sunburn. Areas of skin where green tea extracts were applied had fewer sunburned cells and less damage to epidermal Langerhans cells, which are responsible for cutaneous immune response. Green tea extracts also seem to prevent UV radiation-induced DNA damage (1359) and apoptotic keratinocytes (53787). Animal models indicate that green tea extracts reduce oxidative skin damage, skin inflammation, and epidermal hyperplasia due to UV radiation and other causes (6065). Unlike conventional sunscreens, green tea extracts do not absorb significant amounts of light in the UV range (1359).\n\nGreen tea polyphenols also appear to have activity against human papilloma virus (HPV)-related cervical dysplasia and genital and perianal warts (Condylomata acuminata) (11310, 15067); however, the mechanism of action is not known.\n\nIn adults with high-risk oral premalignant lesions, green tea extract downregulated stromal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclin D1 expression which was associated with clinical suppression of oral premalignant lesions (53936).\n\nSome evidence suggests that green tea may enhance the anticancer effects of some chemotherapeutic agents. There is preliminary in vitro and xenograft evidence that green tea might enhance the effects of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) on tumor cells (3940, 90152, 90157, 90165, 90182). The caffeine, theanine, and EGCG constituents appear to increase the concentration of doxorubicin inside tumor cells by inhibiting the efflux mechanisms that remove doxorubicin from the cell (7690, 90152, 90157, 90165). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that EGCG increases apoptosis induced by gemcitabine (53843). Also, in a tamoxifen-resistant cell line in vitro, EGCG reduced the activity of the proteins, P-glycoprotein and the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), which play a role in drug metabolism and transport (90142). EGCG from green tea is structurally similar to methotrexate and aminopterin and also appears to inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This antifolate activity results in inhibition of lymphoma cell growth and apoptosis in vitro (15012).\n\nIn vitro, EGCG inhibited the proteolytic enzyme urokinase, which is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis (53732, 54099). EGCG has also been shown to downregulate the laminin receptor, involved in cell differentiation, migration, and adhesion (53913) and inhibits the migration and invasion of some cell lines (53862). The inhibition of the metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) by EGCG and green tea may also play a role in the inhibition of migration of cancer cells (53997). Antiproliferative effects of EGCG may be modulated through the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor-2 (Nrf2) expression and increases in uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A (UGT1A) levels in vitro and in animal models (53908). In pancreatic cells in vitro, proliferation was inhibited by EGCG by a mechanism involving the inhibition of the focal adhesion kinase and the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (54020).\nAnticoagulant and antiplatelet effects\nThere is some evidence green tea suppresses thromboxane formation during blood clotting by inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid from platelets (8028, 12882, 54067, 54078).\nAntidiabetic effects\nCaffeine has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose. In people with type 2 diabetes, acute administration of caffeine impairs postprandial glucose metabolism, while acute abstention from caffeine reduces postprandial glucose levels by 21%. Whether these effects also occur with caffeinated beverages and herbs is unknown (12374). Other research in obese people suggests that caffeine ingestion may contribute to insulin resistance (12375, 13744). However, one study found that patients with type 1 diabetes taking 200 mg of caffeine twice daily had increased frequency and intensity of warning signs of hypoglycemia. This may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the brain and an increase in glucose utilization by the brain (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740).\n\nGreen tea itself has also been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose, or no effect, in human research. However, a meta-analysis of numerous clinical trials suggests that there is a decrease in blood glucose when individuals with diabetes, prediabetes, and normal glucose levels are combined (54011, 54035, 54056, 54068, 90154). In addition, taking green tea reduces postprandial glucose levels at an evening meal, but not a morning meal, possibly by reducing levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (102724). In animal diabetic models, green tea extract and EGCG decreased blood glucose (3922, 53749).\nAntidiarrheal effects\nTannins in green tea can produce antidiarrheal effects. The polyphenols in green tea might increase the level of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and reduce the population of enterobacteria (3941).\nAntilipemic effects\nIn human research, green tea taken orally seems to lower total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (11308, 54038, 54048, 90146, 90161). Some of this research also suggests green tea may lower triglycerides and increase levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. In animal research, green tea also resulted in a decrease in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels (53890, 54101). Possible mechanisms of action may involve the inhibition of ileal apical sodium bile acid transporter (ASBT) activity as shown by EGCG in vitro (53958).\nAntioxidant effects\nThe antioxidant effects of green tea and its constituent catechins are thought to explain some of its clinical effects, especially related to its anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, and cardiovascular benefits. In human research, green tea and its catechins have been shown to protect against the oxidative damage caused by exercise (53766, 54053) and smoking (4212, 53791), as well as general oxidative exposure (53734, 53989, 53994, 54068, 54117, 90168). One meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that green tea increases total antioxidant capacity but does not reduce levels of malondialdehyde. However, no antioxidant effects were identified in a meta-analysis of research on individuals with obesity (107157) or in a clinical trial on individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (114894). The antioxidant effects of green tea and its constituents may relate to their ability to scavenge free radicals, chelate redox active transition-metal ions, inhibit redox active transcription factors, inhibit pro-oxidant enzymes, and induce antioxidant enzymes (53750, 53772, 53794, 53817, 53837, 53912, 53960, 90172, 90174). However, some studies in humans have not shown these antioxidant benefits (9230, 36583, 36592, 53734, 53735).\nAntiviral effects\nIn vitro, the catechins in green tea have shown activity against HIV replication, although less so than black tea, which contains theaflavins (15658). In vitro, the green tea constituent EGCG has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity of human T cells and macrophages, as well as antigen production, by a mechanism not involving cytotoxicity, cell growth inhibition, or apoptosis (53840). EGCG has also been shown to inhibit the activity of and degrade the semen-derived enhancer of virus infection (SEVI), possibly leading to decreased semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection (53871). Tea polyphenols are also nonspecifically effective against both influenza A and B viruses; the polyphenols bind to the hemagglutinin of influenza virus, inhibiting absorption and entry into cells (36544). In vitro, EGCG inhibited infection of kidney cells by rotaviruses and enteroviruses, in a manner involving interference with virus adsorption (36417). In vitro, green tea extract decreased the efficiency of the vaccinia virus (53965). Although there is little information in humans, green tea capsules resulted in a reduced human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) in HTLV-1 carriers (53717).\nBlood pressure effects\nThere is contradictory evidence about tea consumption and hypertension. Some population research suggests drinking green tea reduces the risk of developing hypertension (12518). Also, some clinical research suggests that taking green tea extract reduces blood pressure in patients with or without hypertension (54068, 90146, 90155, 90159, 90161). However, other clinical and epidemiological studies on normotensive and hypertensive patients show that green tea or black tea has no effect on blood pressure (1452, 15655, 54080). Furthermore, increases in blood pressure have been shown in some studies (54014, 54065). Also, caffeine, found in green tea, can acutely elevate both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, although caffeine may not have this effect in habitual users (2722). In animal research, green tea extracts prevented angiotensin-induced increases in blood pressure and heart tissue damage, possibly via the prevention of hydrogen peroxide radicals (53757, 53798).\nBone effects\nEpidemiological research suggests that drinking green tea for at least ten years increases bone mineral density. The exact mechanism for the effects on bone is unknown, but several possibilities have been suggested. Tea leaves contain fluoride, which might slow osteoporosis. Tea also contains flavonoids and phytoestrogens, which might affect bone mineral density. Other proposed mechanisms include inhibition of bone resorption and effects on mineral metabolism by polyphenols and tannins (8116). Green tea extract is also of interest for modulating facial development in children with Down syndrome. Animal research suggests that green tea extract beneficially alters craniofacial skeletons; however, high doses had negative effects (107167).\nCardiovascular effects\nThe cardiovascular effects of green tea may be related to its constituent polyphenols and/or caffeine. Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine (519) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup (4218). The caffeine in green tea stimulates the heart and possibly the pressor centers that control blood pressure (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (6370). Caffeine can have positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart (11836).\n\nSome preliminary studies show that flavonoids found in green tea might reduce lipoprotein oxidation (6032, 6033, 9232). In vitro tests indicate that catechins in green tea reduce proliferation of vascular smooth muscle that occurs with high concentrations of low-density lipoproteins (9229). However, when used in humans, green tea doesn't consistently exhibit useful effects on cardiovascular risk factors. In human research, green tea consumption promoted flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery and improved the function of endothelial cells in blood vessels (53721, 53743, 53778). However, does not always appear to reduce inflammation, vascular reactivity, or lipid oxidation, and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers may not be affected (37785). This may be due to low bioavailability of polyphenols (9230, 9231).\nCNS effects\nGreen tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine (519) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup (4218). The caffeine in green tea stimulates the central nervous system (CNS) (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (6370). It has also been proposed that caffeine may decrease GABA and serotonin signaling (6370).\nCognitive effects\nGreen tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine (519) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup (4218). The caffeine content is thought to be responsible for green tea's effects on cognitive performance (4221).\nCytochrome P450 effects\nTea has been reported to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A1, 1A2, and 2B1 (3941, 53739) and to inhibit CYP3A4 (53835) in vitro. While one study reported that green tea extract does not alter CYP3A4 or 2D6 activity in healthy volunteers (14429), another showed that green tea catechin induced a small reduction in CYP34A activity, while having no effect on CYP1A2, CYP12D6, and CYP12C9 activity (53747).\nDental effects\nIn human research, green tea extract appears to reduce plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation (7594). Also, when applied as a gel to the periodontal pocket, green tea appears to improve gingivitis, periodontal disease, and clinical attachment (90135). The polyphenols in green tea appear to reduce the cellular adhesiveness of bacteria associated with dental disease (7594, 53738, 54121). Also, green tea has demonstrated direct activity against oral bacteria in vitro (53705, 53858, 54022, 54060, 54071) and in humans after rinsing with green tea (102725, 102727). In addition, certain green tea constituents inhibit the synthesis of bacterial insoluble glucan, the sticky substance that facilitates the accumulation of the microorganisms on smooth tooth surfaces and subsequent development of dental caries (36456, 54121). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that the catechins epicatechin gallate (ECG) and EGCG inhibit pro-inflammatory signals normally upregulated by bacterial pathogens in dental pulp fibroblasts (53972). In humans, EGCG has been shown to reduce the progression of dental erosion, possibly mediated through its ability to inhibit the MMP enzymes (53975).\nDermatological effects\nSome evidence suggests that oral and topical application of products containing green tea may improve skin elasticity, hydration, and roughness (53731, 53924, 54030, 54062). Evidence suggests that EGCG and EGC might inhibit 5 alpha-reductase and might potentially be useful in androgen-mediated skin disorders such as androgenic alopecia, hirsutism, and acne (8113). Green tea is thought to be beneficial for preventing skin damage and cancer from ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to the antioxidant effects of polyphenols in green tea. Polyphenolic extracts of green tea, specifically EGCG and epicatechin-3-gallate, seem to produce dose-dependent topical protection against UVA and UVB sunburn. Areas of skin where green tea extracts were applied had fewer sunburned cells and less damage to epidermal Langerhans cells, which are responsible for cutaneous immune response. Green tea extracts also seem to prevent UV radiation-induced DNA damage (1359). Animal models indicate that green tea extracts reduce oxidative skin damage, skin inflammation, and epidermal hyperplasia due to UV radiation and other causes (6065). Human research suggests topical application of EGCG on sun-protected skin prevents the UVB-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells and erythema, possibly by inhibiting prostaglandins (53674, 90167). Unlike conventional sunscreens, green tea extracts do not absorb significant amounts of light in the UV range (1359). Preliminary clinical research also suggests that topical application of EGCG reduces acne severity (54074). The beneficial effects of green tea for acne may be related to both the inhibition of Propionibacterium acnes, as well as the cytotoxic effects on sebocytes leading to a reduced sebum production as shown in vitro (54074).\nDiuretic effects\nGreen tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine (519) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup (4218). Caffeine exerts a diuretic effect, with water losses estimated at 1.17 mL per milligram of caffeine (2712). Tachyphylaxis to the diuretic effect develops rapidly, diminishing fluid losses associated with caffeine intake (10206). However, caffeine-containing beverages consumed during moderate endurance exercise do not appear to compromise bodily hydration status (2713). Also, caffeine doesn't substantially affect the fluid status of people who drink caffeinated beverages on a regular basis (10206).\nExercise effects\nIn human research, green tea polyphenols improved muscular endurance (54040). The caffeine content of green tea is thought to be responsible for its effects on performance (4221). Also, protection against exercise-induced antioxidant damage may play a role (54053, 104606).\nGastrointestinal effects\nGreen tea is commonly used for the prevention of gastric cancer. The caffeine in green tea is known to stimulate gastric acid secretion (11837).\nHepatic effects\nAlthough case reports exist of hepatotoxic effects of green tea and its extract (14136, 15026, 53740, 53742, 53746, 53775, 54016, 54027, 90143, 90164)(92356, 102722), clinical research suggests the potential for benefits in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (90168). Also, population research suggests consuming more green tea, especially more than 10 cups daily, is related to decreased concentrations of hepatological markers in serum, including aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transferase, and ferritin, indicating that green tea may act protectively against disorders of the liver (6403).\nHormonal effects\nPopulation research shows mixed results with respect to the preventative effects of green tea for breast cancer or its recurrence (3926, 13189, 14426, 14427, 53866, 54112, 90181). Interestingly, green tea intake is inversely correlated with serum concentrations of estradiol on menstrual cycle day 11 in females; this may explain the potential for benefit in hormone-related cancers (54106). Also, in animal research, green tea reduced blood levels of testosterone, estradiol, leptin, luteinizing hormone, and insulin-like growth factor (3922). However, in humans, the green tea extract enriched in EGCG, Polyphenon E did not have consistent effects on testosterone, estradiol, and estrone levels (54056).\nImmunologic effects\nThere is some evidence from clinical research that taking green tea formulations reduces the risk of developing clinical cold or flu symptoms (53754, 54021). Also, clinical research suggests that drinking a green tea high in a specific catechin reduces allergy symptoms associated with Japanese cedar pollen (53884, 90156). In human research, green tea increased the proliferation of gamma-delta T cells (53754). Also, in vitro, in Jurkat T cells, EGCG induced the production of specific cytokines (53830).\nNeurologic effects\nGreen tea is thought to have some potential neurological benefits. For prevention of Parkinson's disease, caffeine in green tea may prevent adenosine's inhibition of dopaminergic transmission. This may result in a reduction in the clinical expression of Parkinsonism (6022, 36389). Green tea may also inhibit dopamine transport in vitro, as well as protect against effects of 6-hydroxydopamine (53706, 53841). In vitro, EGCG has been shown to prevent the damage of dopaminergic cells by activated microglial cells by inhibiting nitric oxide and cytokine production (36407).\n\nPreliminary evidence also suggests that EGCG may prevent oxidation and apoptosis of neurons, which may protect people from developing Alzheimer's disease (9224). Also, in vitro and in animals, EGCG has been shown to increase the secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein or decrease levels of A beta protein, inhibiting the formation of beta-amyloid peptide, associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (36396, 53751).\n\nThe green tea constituent EGCG may also directly affect brain function. In humans, EGCG increased alpha, beta, and theta activity, mainly in the frontal and medial frontal gyrus (54055) and brain theta waves in the temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital areas (54019).\n\nClinical research in adults with obesity suggests that following exercise guidance in conjunction with a calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet enriched with an additional daily intake of 800 mg polyphenols from green tea and Wolffia globose may provide neuroprotective effects against age-related neurodegeneration by reducing grey matter atrophy and preserving hippocampal volume (107982).\nRespiratory effects\nGreen tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine (519) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup (4218). Caffeine decreases airway resistance and stimulates respiration, via adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (11836).\nWeight loss effects\nGreen tea is commonly used for weight loss. Evidence from clinical trials is mixed, although some studies do show weight loss with specific products (8114, 37725, 53994, 54039). Early evidence indicates that a green tea extract rich in EGCG can increase calorie and fat metabolism. The caffeine, catechin, and theanine constituents of green tea might contribute to this effect (1453, 8115, 11960). Caffeine increases resting energy expenditure (REE) and cellular thermogenesis. It also causes an increase in nonoxidative fatty acid turnover and lipid oxidation; however, the net effect on lipid oxidation is small. The effects of caffeine on energy expenditure and lipid metabolism seem to be mediated by both sympathetic and nonsympathetic mechanisms (13733). Green tea might also affect energy expenditure in humans. However, thermogenic response or energy expenditure were not significantly increased in all studies (1453, 8114, 37712, 48831, 53685, 53708, 53869, 53999, 54122, 98422). In healthy young men, green tea extract increased fat oxidation during exercise (53764). There is also some evidence that EGCG might suppress appetite in animal research (3922). However, there is some question about how well EGCG is absorbed orally (3922). In human research, although green tea reduced food intakes, changes in body weight and body composition were lacking (98422). The impact of EGCG and green tea on weight loss remains to be determined with well-designed studies in obese or overweight individuals."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe important part of Griffonia simplicifolia is the seeds (90430). The main constituent of interest is 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (90430). Other constituents include beta-carboline alkaloids such as griffonine, hyrtioerectine B, hyrtiosulawesine, trigonelline, and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Less is known about these constituents. However, some have also been shown to have pharmacological effects in vitro (102151).\nAnalgesic effects\nGriffonia simplicifolia is traditionally used for headaches. Although the mechanism of action is not clear, some analgesic activity of the constituent 5-HTP has been reported in animal pain models (30041).\nAntidepressant effects\nGriffonia simplicifolia is traditionally used for depression. The mechanism of action is thought to be related to the constituent 5-HTP. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that taking 5-HTP orally improves depression symptoms (30112). 5-HTP crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to serotonin, raising serotonin levels in the CNS (901). Although, human research involving Griffonia simplicifolia is limited, some early research suggests that oral use increases levels of platelet serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, indicating a modulation of the serotonergic system (102149). Furthermore, in animal research, Griffonia simplicifolia increased levels of serotonin in the hypothalamus (102153).\nAnxiolytic effects\nGriffonia simplicifolia is traditionally used for anxiety. The mechanism of action is thought to be related to the constituent 5-HTP. In human research, Griffonia simplicifolia seed extract reduced feelings of stress (102149). Furthermore, animal models suggest that Griffonia simplicifolia extract has anxiolytic effects which may be related to one or more constituents, including 5-HTP (102152).\nWeight loss effects\nTraditionally, Griffonia simplicifolia is used for weight loss. Change in body composition has been reported in preliminary human research (30051) and weight loss has been reported in animal models (30068, 102153). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, increased satiety or decreased appetite may result in reduced food intake (30051, 30068, 102153). It is possible that the constituent 5-HTP is involved in these effects. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that taking 5-HTP orally improves satiety, reduces caloric intake, and increases weight loss in moderately overweight or obese patients (914, 30018, 30114). This is possibly by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain (901). Although, human research involving Griffonia simplicifolia is limited, some early research suggests that oral use increases levels of platelet serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, indicating a modulation of the serotonergic system (102149). Furthermore, in animal research, Griffonia simplicifolia increased levels of serotonin in the hypothalamus (102153)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGround ivy is a rich plant source of potassium and iron (19, 96262). It has a high phenol content (54193) and contains triterpenoids, such as ursolic acid and oleanic acid (54201, 54202). The leaves, stalk, and roots contain polyunsaturated fatty acids (54199, 54200). Fresh ground ivy contains significantly less fatty acid when compared to the air-dried herb (54199). It also contains rosmarinic acid (4). Flavonoids have also been identified in an extract of ground ivy (54194, 54203).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that ground ivy inhibits the release of interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, decreasing the release of nitric oxide in a dose-dependent manner (54198). It also inhibits the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-12 and TNF-alpha, but does not effect IL-6 production.\nAnti-lithogenic effects\nIn animal research, ground ivy extract reduced the production of gallstones. Mechanisms of action may have included effects on bile acid composition and antioxidant activity (108157).\nAnticancer effects\nAnimal research shows that ursolic acid and oleanolic acid isolated from ground ivy inhibit the activation of Epstein Barr virus (54201). These constituents also inhibit tumor promotion in mouse skin.\nDermatologic effects\nThere is interest in using ground ivy for ultraviolet (UV) induced radiation and pigmentation. UV radiation leads to an inflammatory response in the skin. The inflammatory response and proinflammatory cytokines that are released cause keratinocytes to produce melanin stimulating factors. These factors stimulate melanocytes, leading to the production of melanin, and thus pigmentation. Ground ivy may suppress this UV-induced inflammatory response in keratinocytes, leading to a reduction of melanin stimulating factors (95014). Laboratory research shows that ground ivy inhibits nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and TNF-alpha, which are both involved in the inflammatory process (95014).\n\nHowever, ground ivy does not appear to directly inhibit the melanin producing activities of melanocytes (95014). Clinical research also shows that topical ground ivy has no effect on naturally occurring hyperpigmented disorders of the face. Thus, ground ivy may have no effect on already developed hyperpigmented areas (95014)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGroundsel is a weed that contains various pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), some of which are toxic. PAs are most concentrated in the plant roots, but may be found in all plant parts. The concentration of PAs may also be higher in plants grown from seeds native to Europe compared to plants grown from seeds invasive to China. It has been reported that groundsel may contain greater than 0.6 mg/g of PAs (12841, 12860, 96276).\nToxic effects\nPyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), particularly unsaturated PAs, can cause hepatotoxicity. Cyclic diesters such as retrorsine and senecionine are the most hepatotoxic. Liver toxicity may result from PA-enhanced oxidative stress, but the exact mechanism of toxicity is unknown. Single doses of 10-20 mg PAs or chronic ingestion of amounts less than 10 mcg can cause veno-occlusive disease. PAs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to toxic metabolites. Enzyme inducers such as phenobarbital seem to enhance toxicity (12841, 12860). Metabolism is also affected by pregnane X receptor induction of CYP3A4. Genetic or drug induced variation in CYP3A4 or pregnane X receptor activity can affect the degree of PA toxicity by increasing or decreasing its metabolism (12841, 12842). Certain metabolites of groundsel are excreted as N-acetyl cysteine conjugates. Some researchers speculate that early administration of N-acetylcysteine might reduce toxicity (11988)."

            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Guar gum has been safely used in doses up to 15 grams daily for up to two years (10326, 10897, 12541, 12543, 12544, 12548, 54212, 54245, 54260, 54275)(54333, 93617, 93619, 93622, 101888). Doses up to 20 grams daily have been safely used for up to 51 weeks (10896, 12545, 12547, 54314). Guar gum has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status as a food additive in the US (4912).\nCHILDREN: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Guar gum has been safely used in doses of 4-5 grams daily for 4 weeks in children 6-16 years of age (93605, 93615). Guar gum 3 grams daily for 4 weeks has been safely used in children 4-6 years of age (93605).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts.

            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, guar gum is generally well tolerated.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, heartburn, gas, and loose stools.\nSerious Adverse Effects (Rare)\nOrally: Severe esophageal and small bowel obstruction when taken with an inadequate amount of fluid.\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, guar gum may cause gastrointestinal adverse effects such as abdominal cramps, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, heartburn, gas, and loose stools (10896, 10897, 12541, 12543, 12545, 12547, 12548, 54209, 54212, 54232)(54260, 54314, 54333, 93617, 93619). Gastrointestinal side effects can be minimized by starting with small doses and titrating up. In one clinical study, taste aversion to guar gum leading to withdrawal from the study has been reported (16736).\n\nWhen guar gum is consumed with inadequate amounts of fluids, it can cause severe esophageal and small bowel obstruction. Tell patients to take guar gum with at least 8 ounces (250 mL) of water (602, 54230).\nless\nPulmonary/Respiratory\nOccupational exposure to guar gum may cause asthma (600, 601).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nPOSSIBLY EFFECTIVE\nConstipation. Oral guar gum may improve symptoms and stool frequency in adults and children with constipation.\nSeveral small clinical studies in adults show that taking partially hydrolyzed guar gum increases stool frequency and relieves straining and pain when compared to baseline. Studied doses include 4-12 grams daily for up to 8 weeks or 11 grams twice daily for up to 3 weeks (12548, 25073, 93619). Small clinical studies in children with constipation also show that taking guar gum 3-5 grams daily for 4 weeks or partially hydrolyzed guar gum 6 grams daily for 2-15 months moderately increases bowel movement frequency and decreases abdominal pain when compared to baseline (93605, 101889). While these improvements appear to be similar to those reported in children treated with lactulose (93605), a direct comparison is lacking.\nless\nDiarrhea. Oral guar gum may reduce the duration of diarrhea in adults and children.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients in the intensive care unit show that adding guar gum 2% or 22 grams/L to enteral feeding formula reduces the number of liquid stools and decreases the percentage of days with diarrhea by around 70% when compared with control enteral formula (10325, 54239). A larger clinical trial in children with acute watery diarrhea due to infections also shows that taking guar gum reduces the duration of diarrhea by around 16 hours when compared with a control (54210). Another clinical study in children with persistent watery diarrhea also shows that adding guar gum 20 grams/L daily for 7 days to a comminuted chicken diet improves the odds of diarrhea resolution after 7 days by 3-fold when compared with the chicken diet alone (54243).\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Oral guar gum, taken alone or with other dietary fibers, may reduce cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia.\nSeveral small clinical trials in patients with hypercholesterolemia show that taking guar gum 15-18 grams in single or divided doses daily for up to 24 months lowers cholesterol levels when compared with baseline levels or placebo (4971, 10897, 54314, 54318, 54333). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 25 small clinical studies in patients with hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hypertension, or metabolic syndrome shows that guar gum reduces total cholesterol by around 20 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 17 mg/dL, but does not reduce triglyceride levels, when compared with controls. Subgroup analyses suggest that improvements in total and LDL cholesterol are greater in patients with hypercholesterolemia and in those taking at least 15 grams of guar gum daily (107930).\n\nAdditional clinical evidence shows that taking guar gum along with other dietary fibers can reduce cholesterol levels. Taking 20 grams of a mixture containing guar gum, pectin, and a small amount of the insoluble fibers from soy, pea, and corn bran daily for 36 weeks lowers total and LDL cholesterol, but does not affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels (12547, 54335). Also, taking a specific product containing guar gum and psyllium (Minolest) 16.5 grams daily for 3 months reduces total and LDL cholesterol when compared with placebo, but does not affect triglyceride levels (54206). Taking 15 grams of a combination of guar gum, psyllium, pectin, and carob gum daily for 6 months also appears to reduce total and LDL cholesterol when compared to baseline (8431).\nless\nHypertension. Oral guar gum may modestly reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure, although these reductions may not be considered clinically significant.\nSeveral small clinical trials in patients with hypertension show that taking guar gum 7-10 grams with each meal daily for up to 6 weeks modestly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo (54232, 54304, 54320). However, guar gum does not appear to be as effective for reducing blood pressure as psyllium husk (54260).\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials in adults also shows that taking guar gum 1-30 grams daily for 6 weeks to 6 months reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 1 mmHg when compared with placebo or no intervention. However, many patients included in these trials did not have hypertension at baseline. Sub-analyses suggest that the effects of guar gum on blood pressure may be larger in patients with hypertension. The validity of this meta-analysis is limited by high heterogeneity (105507).\nless\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral guar gum may improve bowel function and abdominal pain in adults and children with IBS.\nClinical trials in adults with IBS show that taking guar gum 5-10 grams daily for 12 weeks improves abdominal pain, bowel function, and quality of life when compared with baseline or wheat bran (10326, 54245). A small clinical study in children 8-16 years of age with chronic abdominal pain and IBS shows that taking partially hydrolyzed guar gum 5 grams daily for 4 weeks decreases symptom frequency and normalizes bowel movements when compared with placebo. However, it does not improve abdominal pain (93615). Another small clinical trial in children 1-18 years of age with IBS shows that taking a specific guar gum product (Resource Optifibre, Nestle HealthCare Nutrition) for at least 6-8 weeks improves stool consistency and abdominal pain when compared to baseline (93621).\nless\nPOSSIBLY INEFFECTIVE\nObesity. Oral guar gum may not improve body weight in patients with obesity.\nSeveral small clinical trials in overweight or obese adults show that taking guar gum 10.5-20 grams in divided doses daily for up to 14 months does not reduce body weight or improve satiety when compared with placebo or other controls (54212, 54260, 54353, 54360). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 11 small clinical studies of various patient populations, including postmenopausal adults and those with hyperlipidemia or diabetes, shows that taking guar gum 7.5-21 grams daily for 3 weeks to 6 months does not reduce body weight when compared with placebo (8305).\nless\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnal fissures. It is unclear if oral guar gum is beneficial in patients with anal fissures.\nA small clinical study in patients with chronic anal fissures treated with topical application of glyceryl trinitrate shows that taking partially hydrolyzed guar gum 5 grams daily as maintenance therapy for a total of 10 months increases success rate by 53% and decreases the risk for recurrence of anal fissures by 52% when compared with control (93617).\nless\nAutism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral guar gum is beneficial in children with autism spectrum disorder.\nA very small clinical study in children 4-9 years of age with autism and constipation shows that taking partially hydrolyzed guar gum (Sunfiber, Taiyo Kagaku Co. Ltd.) 6 grams daily for 2-15 months moderately improves irritability, but not other measures of behavior, when compared to baseline (101889). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral guar gum is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea.\nA clinical study in patients receiving 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy for colorectal cancer shows that adding guar gum (Novasource GI control, Novartis Nutrition) 11 grams daily on cycle days 7-14 for 24 weeks to treatment with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG does not reduce the rate of severe diarrhea or other abdominal complaints when compared with no treatment or L. rhamnosus GG alone (16736).\nless\nCholera. It is unclear if oral guar gum is beneficial for improving diarrhea in patients with cholera.\nA small clinical study in adults with cholera treated with doxycycline shows that adding guar gum 25-50 grams to oral rehydration solution for 2 days does not reduce the duration of diarrhea, but might reduce stool weight over the first 24 hours, when compared with oral rehydration solution alone (54262).\nless\nCholestasis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral guar gum may not improve symptoms of cholestasis during pregnancy.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with cholestasis during pregnancy show that taking a specific granulated guar gum product (Guarem, Orion Pharmaceutical) 5-15 grams daily until delivery does not reduce the intensity of pruritus or improve liver function when compared with placebo (54209, 54356).\nless\nDiabetes. Small clinical studies suggest that oral guar gum might improve postprandial glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes; whether guar gum is effective for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is unclear.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with type 1 diabetes show that taking guar gum 5 grams with meals four times daily for 4-6 weeks lowers postprandial glucose levels when compared with placebo (10896, 12545). However, clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes show conflicting results. Several very small clinical studies suggest that taking guar gum 5-7.6 grams with each meal daily for up to 48 weeks lowers blood glucose when compared with baseline levels or placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes (12540, 12541, 12542, 12543, 12544). However, other small clinical trials in these patients show that taking guar gum 5-7 grams with each meal for up to 3 months does not improve glycemic control (54270, 54275, 54320, 54326). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear; however, all of the studies in patients with type 2 diabetes were very small and likely underpowered to identify significant treatment effects.\n\nIn addition to glycemic control, the effect of guar gum on serum lipids in patients with diabetes has also been evaluated. A meta-analysis of 11 small clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes with or without hypercholesterolemia shows that taking guar gum 5-30 grams daily for up to 6 months reduces total cholesterol by around 20 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 15 mg/dL. Doses of guar gum 20 grams daily or greater also appear to reduce triglyceride levels by around 13 mg/dL, while lower doses have no effect (107929).\nless\nInfluenza. It is unclear if oral guar gum is beneficial for the prevention of influenza.\nObservational research in hospitalized patients has found that taking partially hydrolyzed guar gum 5.2 grams daily for the duration of a hospital stay is associated with a lower risk of influenza when compared with those not taking guar gum. One additional case of influenza appears to be prevented for every 14 patients taking guar gum over placebo (107928).\nless\nMalnourishment-related diarrhea. It is unclear if oral guar gum is beneficial in children with malnourishment-related diarrhea.\nA small clinical study in children aged 6-36 months with acute watery diarrhea related to malnutrition shows that adding guar gum 15 grams/L to oral rehydration solution reduces the duration of diarrhea by around 18 hours when compared with oral rehydration solution alone (93616).\nless\nPostprandial hypotension. Small clinical studies suggest that oral guar gum may be beneficial for the prevention of postprandial hypotension in older females and patients with type 2 diabetes.\nA small clinical study in older females with postprandial hypotension shows that taking guar gum 9 grams along with a meal decreases the risk of postprandial hypotension by 75% when compared with placebo (93618). Another small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking guar gum 9 grams prior to a meal reduces the risk of postprandial decreases in blood pressure when compared to baseline (12540).\nless\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). It is unclear if oral guar gum is beneficial in patients with SIBO.\nA small clinical study in patients with SIBO shows that taking guar gum 5 grams daily along with rifaximin 1200 mg daily for 10 days increases the chance for eradication of SIBO by 37% to 40% when compared with rifaximin alone. However, overall clinical improvement appears to be similar for guar gum plus rifaximin and rifaximin alone (93622).\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate guar gum for these uses.",

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\nStandardization & Formulation\nNumerous guar gum preparations are available, such as breads, nutrition bars, granules, powders, and tablets. The chemical and pharmacological properties may vary; viscosity of guar gum has been shown to influence the efficacy of these preparations. Low-viscosity preparations like wax-coated granules have been shown to be less effective than high-viscosity preparations like flour preparations, particularly in regard to lowering postprandial insulin levels (93620).\n\nMany guar gum products on the market, known as partially hydrolyzed guar gum, have been hydrolyzed to produce smaller, less viscous, non-gel-forming fibers.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGuar gum is a dietary fiber derived from the seeds of the guar plant (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba). These seeds are also known as Indian cluster beans. Guar gum is classified as a galactomannan because of its high molecular weight and composition primarily of galactose anhydride and mannose anhydride. It is a source of soluble dietary fiber (67.5 grams/100 grams of dry matter) and insoluble dietary fiber (14.8 grams/100 grams of dry matter) (54250).\nAntidiabetic effects\nIn human research, guar gum has been found to decrease fasting and postprandial blood glucose (12542, 54213, 54217, 54218, 54227, 54265, 54330, 54341). It may do so by slowing the delivery of carbohydrate to the small intestine which may also increase hepatic extraction of insulin (12540, 12541, 12542, 30518, 54302, 54312, 54319, 54324). However, research in this area is not consistent, as a lack of effect has been reported in some studies (40001, 54287, 54305, 54308).\nBlood pressure effects\nGuar gum supplementation has been found to reduce blood pressure in healthy and obese patients (54232, 54304, 54320). Conversely, it has also been found to attenuate hypotension following intraduodenal and oral glucose load, possibly by slowing gastric emptying and glucose absorption (12540, 54211, 54247). This effect may occur as result of reduced gastric emptying and absorption of glucose (12540, 54247).\nCholesterol effects\nThe exact mechanism of guar gum in lowering cholesterol is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include reduction of absorption of cholesterol, interruption of enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, and involvement of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, and nuclear sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor-2 (SREBF-2) (54208, 54257, 54316, 54340, 54345, 54352).\nGastrointestinal effects\nDietary fibers like guar gum are popularly used to improve bowel function. Guar gum is a water-soluble, bulk-forming laxative that promotes regular bowel movements and stimulates the movement of waste and toxins from the bowel and colon. When ingested, it expands in the presence of water and tends to normalize bowel function. Like other fibers, it adsorbs glucose and lipids in the gut and decreases their absorption. In animal and human research, guar gum delayed gastric transit and emptying and increased the viscosity of stomach contents (12540, 12541, 12542, 54336, 54354). In humans, there is some evidence that taking partially hydrolyzed guar gum alters the gut microbiota (101888, 101889). Fermentation in the large intestine by guar gum led to the production of short-chain fatty acids, which may improve colon function and improve water absorption (54210, 54243).\nPlasminogen-activator inhibitory (PAI-1) activity\nIn human research, guar gum decreased PAI-1 activity, which may contribute to beneficial atherogenic and thrombogenic activity and correlate to insulin concentrations, degree of insulin resistance, and glucose uptake (54232).\nWeight loss effects\nGuar gum is of interest for weight loss. Some, but not all, clinical research shows that taking guar gum reduces post-meal energy intake and increases satiety (101893). However, most clinical research shows that taking guar gum does not improve weight loss (8305, 54212, 54260, 54353, 54360)."

        "sections": {
            "Overview": "Guarana is a creeping shrub or vine that is native to the rainforest in South America. The fruit, or seed, of guarana contains 3.6% to 5.8% caffeine and is often used as a stimulant or for weight loss (11845, 91487, 91488, 91490). Guarana is a common ingredient in energy drinks, herbal formulas, and protein bars (91490, 95503). Guarana seeds are traditionally used for their stimulant and aphrodisiac properties, as well as for joint and muscle pain, headaches, diarrhea, and to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD).",
            "Safety": "LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts typically found in foods. Guarana has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status for use in foods in the US (4912).\nPOSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately, short-term (12). Guarana contains caffeine. According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, doses of caffeine up to 400 mg daily are not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults (11733, 98806). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults (98806).\nPOSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally long-term or in high doses. Guarana contains a significant amount of caffeine. Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, psychological dependence, and other significant adverse effects. Acute use of high doses, typically above 400 mg per day, has been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmias and sleep disturbances (11832, 95503, 98806). These effects would not be expected to occur with the consumption of decaffeinated guarana.\nLIKELY UNSAFE when used orally in very high doses. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram). Serious toxicity can occur at lower doses depending on variables in caffeine sensitivity such as smoking, age, or prior caffeine use (11832, 54425).\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods. Due to the caffeine content of guarana, intake should be closely monitored during pregnancy to ensure moderate consumption. Although it is not considered a teratogen, caffeine crosses the placenta and causes dose-dependent increases in fetal blood concentrations (4260). The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects (2708, 2709, 2710, 2711, 9606, 11733, 16014, 16015, 98806). In some studies, consuming amounts over 200 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage (16014). This increased risk may be most likely to occur in individuals with genotypes that confer a slow rate of caffeine metabolism (98806). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, caffeine can be safely consumed in doses up to 300 mg daily without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations (11733, 98806). However, some research has also found that intrauterine exposure to even modest amounts of caffeine, based on maternal blood levels during the first trimester, is associated with a shorter stature in children ages 4-8 years (109846). Advise individuals to keep caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily during pregnancy.\nPREGNANCY: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in amounts over 300 mg daily. Although it is not considered a teratogen, caffeine crosses the placenta and causes dose-dependent increases in fetal blood concentrations (4260, 98806). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 300 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage in some studies (16014, 98806). Advise keeping caffeine consumption from all sources below 300 mg daily. High maternal doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants (9891). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight (2709, 2711).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Due to the caffeine content of guarana, intake should be closely monitored when breast-feeding. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of serum concentrations (9892).\nLACTATION: POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used orally in large amounts. Consumption of guarana might cause irritability and increased bowel activity in nursing infants (6026). Large doses or excessive intake of guarana should be avoided when breast-feeding.",
            "Adverse Effects": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nGeneral\nOrally, guarana is typically well tolerated when used in moderation. Due to its caffeine content, use of large doses may be unsafe.\nMost Common Adverse Effects\nOrally: Stomach burning and nausea.\nCardiovascular\nOrally, a case of premature ventricular contraction has been reported for a 51-year-old female who used guarana as part of a multi-ingredient herbal product (54372).\n\nGuarana contains caffeine. Although acute administration of caffeine can increase blood pressure, regular consumption does not seem to increase either blood pressure or pulse, even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722). Also, epidemiological research suggests there is no association between caffeine consumption and increased incidence of hypertension. Habitual coffee consumption doesn't seem to be related to hypertension, but habitual consumption of sugared or diet cola is associated with development of hypertension (13739).\n\nCombining ephedra with guarana can increase the risk of adverse effects. Cases of hypertension and chest pain have been reported for patients who took products containing guarana and ephedra (8644, 54376). A case of cerebral infarction has also been reported for a patient consuming ephedra extract and guarana (48746). There is also a report of ischemic stroke in an athlete who consumed ephedra 40-60 mg, creatine monohydrate 6 grams, caffeine 400-600 mg, and a variety of other supplements daily for six weeks (1275).\nless\nDermatologic\nGuarana contains caffeine. There are several case reports of urticaria after caffeine ingestion (36546, 36448, 36475).\nless\nEndocrine\nGuarana contains caffeine. Some evidence shows caffeine is associated with fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer, and endometriosis; however, this is controversial since findings are conflicting (8043). Restricting caffeine in people with fibrocystic breast conditions doesn't seem to affect breast nodularity, swelling, or pain (8996). A population analysis of the Women's Health Initiative observational study has found no association between consumption of caffeine-containing beverages and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and reproductive factors (108806). Also, a dose-response analysis of 2 low-quality observational studies has found that high consumption of caffeine is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (108807).\n\nAlthough the effects of guarana alone are not clear, the combination of guarana along with ephedra has been reported to cause increased blood glucose levels and decreased blood levels of potassium (54376).\nless\nGastrointestinal\nOrally, guarana can cause a sensation of burning in the stomach and vomiting (54414, 91487). These effects may be due to caffeine in guarana. Orally, caffeine can cause gastric irritation, nausea, and vomiting (11832, 11838, 13735). In infants, caffeine may also cause feeding intolerance and gastrointestinal irritation (6023).\nless\nImmunologic\nGuarana contains caffeine. When taken orally, caffeine can cause anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals, although true IgE-mediated caffeine allergy seems to be relatively rare (11315).\nless\nMusculoskeletal\nIn a clinical trial of guarana extract, one person abandoned treatment due to symptoms of arthritis with edema. It is not clear if this adverse effect is due to guarana (91487).\n\nCases of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria have been reported in individuals that have taken products containing guarana in combination with ephedra and other herbal products. These adverse effects are thought to be related to the caffeine content of guarana (19154, 36466).\n\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the relationship between caffeine use and the risk for osteoporosis is contradictory. Caffeine can increase urinary excretion of calcium (2669, 10202, 11317). Women identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to be at an increased risk for the detrimental effect of caffeine on bone mass (2669). However, moderate caffeine intake, less than 300 mg per day, does not seem to significantly increase osteoporosis risk in most postmenopausal women with normal calcium intake (2669, 6025, 10202, 11317).\nless\nNeurologic/CNS\nOrally, guarana can cause dizziness (91483). The caffeine in guarana can cause insomnia (especially in children), nervousness, restlessness, dizziness, tremors, delirium, and convulsions. Other symptoms include headache, anxiety, and agitation (10755, 11832, 11838, 13735, 108016).\n\nTaking guarana with ephedra can cause insomnia, irritability, dizziness, and headache (3719). The combination of ephedra and caffeine in guarana might also increase the risk of adverse effects such as jitteriness, seizures, and temporary loss of consciousness (2729, 21015).\nless\nOcular/Otic\nGuarana contains caffeine. When taken orally, caffeine can cause ringing in the ears (11832, 11838, 13735).\nless\nPsychiatric\nIn a clinical trial, depression was reported by one person taking guarana extract (91483).\nless\nRenal\nGuarana contains caffeine. When taken orally, caffeine can cause diuresis (11832, 11838, 13735).\nless\nOther\nGuarana contains caffeine. The existence or clinical importance of caffeine withdrawal is controversial. Some researchers think that if it exists, it appears to be of little clinical significance (11839). Other researchers suggest symptoms such as headache; tiredness and fatigue; decreased energy, alertness, and attentiveness; drowsiness; decreased contentedness; depressed mood; difficulty concentrating; irritability; and lack of clear-headedness are typical of caffeine withdrawal (13738). Withdrawal symptoms such as delirium, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea, nervousness, restlessness, anxiety, muscle tension, muscle pains, and flushed face have been described. However, these symptoms may be from nonpharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation of effects. Clinically significant symptoms caused by caffeine withdrawal may be uncommon (2723, 11839).\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nAnxiety. Oral guarana has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking two tablets of a specific product (Euphytose) containing hawthorn, black horehound, passionflower, valerian, cola nut, and guarana three times daily for 28 days can reduce the severity of anxiety in a greater percentage of patients with adjustment disorder with anxious mood compared to placebo (6250). However, because guarana was included in the supplement as a mild stimulant, it is unclear if this component contributed to the antianxiety effect of the product.\nless\nAthletic performance. Oral guarana has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nClinical research shows that taking a single dose of a specific product (Berocca Boost, Bayer) containing guarana 222.2 mg (standardized to 40 mg caffeine), B vitamins, vitamin C, and minerals slightly improves exercise tolerance in trained individuals by approximately 2% when compared with placebo (91491). A small crossover study in young adult recreational handball players shows that taking a specific multi-ingredient supplement product (Olimp, Poland) containing guarana, caffeine, and other ingredients (total caffeine content 300 mg) prior to exercise slightly improves the time to complete agility testing but does not increase jump height when compared with placebo. However, taking a supplement containing only guarana and caffeine (total caffeine content 300 mg) does not improve agility or jump height (111577). It is unclear if the effects in these studies are due to guarana, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nCancer-related anorexia. It is unclear if oral guarana is beneficial for anorexia in patients with cancer.\nA preliminary clinical study shows that taking guarana extract might improve appetite and reduce weight loss in some patients with cancer-related anorexia. Taking guarana extract (Pharmanostra) 50 mg twice daily for 4 weeks stabilized or increased weight in 55% of patients and stabilized or improved appetite in 89% of patients. However, only two patients achieved a weight gain of at least 5%, which was the minimum weight gain considered to be a positive response (91487).\nless\nCancer-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral guarana is beneficial for fatigue in patients with cancer.\nMeta-analyses of small clinical studies in patients with solid tumors or breast cancer who are receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy show that taking guarana 75-100 mg daily for 2-12 weeks does not improve cancer-related fatigue when compared with placebo (108016, 111576). Additionally, a systematic review of clinical studies in patients with a variety of solid tumor types found no difference in cancer-related fatigue following at least 5 weeks of guarana consumption (108016). Most studies included in the meta-analysis and systematic review were low-quality, and all studies were conducted in Brazil. Higher quality studies in other geographic locations are needed to confirm these findings.\nless\nChemotherapy-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral guarana is beneficial for fatigue in patients receiving chemotherapy.\nIn patients with breast cancer, clinical research shows taking guarana extract 50 mg twice daily for 21 days improves fatigue in 52% to 66% of patients, compared with only 10% to 13% in the placebo group (91482). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking guarana extract 37.5 mg twice daily for 3 weeks improves or stabilizes fatigue in 90% of patients with chemotherapy-related fatigue when compared with baseline. However, when compared with placebo for an additional 3 weeks, guarana does not affect fatigue (91483). Other clinical research shows that taking a dried, purified extract of guarana (PC-18) in doses of 7.5, 12.5, or 37.5 mg twice daily for 21 days improves fatigue in patients with breast cancer when compared with baseline, but not when compared with placebo. It is possible that the magnesium silicate used as a filler in both active and placebo treatments in this study contributed a fatigue-reducing effect (99049).\nless\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral guarana for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of guarana for this condition.\nCognitive function. It is unclear if oral guarana is beneficial for improving cognitive function.\nIn healthy individuals, some clinical research shows that taking a single dose of guarana dry extract 37.5-75 mg, containing 11% to 12% caffeine, improves the speed of cognitive task performance and memory for up to 6 hours, but does not improve reaction time or speed and accuracy of memory, when compared with placebo. Higher doses of guarana 150-300 mg do not appear to be effective (54374, 91484). However, a small clinical study in young adult cyclists shows that taking guarana powder 125 mg/kg 30 minutes prior to cognitive testing improves reaction time and alertness scores when compared with placebo, but not when compared with caffeine (111361). Other clinical research shows that taking guarana powder 500 mg, containing 2.1% to 2.5% caffeine, twice daily for 3-150 days does not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo in adults or elderly individuals (54402, 54414).\n\nSome research has evaluated guarana in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical studies show that taking a specific product containing guarana 222 mg, B vitamins, vitamin C, and minerals (Berocca Boost, Bayer) can improve the speed and accuracy of visual information processing, working memory, and attention, as well as decrease mental fatigue, when compared to placebo (91485, 91489, 91491). Another specific combination product containing guarana 300 mg and other ingredients (Isoxan Actiflash, Menarini, NHS) improves reaction time by almost 600 msec for up to 90 minutes when compared with placebo or caffeine alone (91488). Conversely, a small clinical study in experienced young-adult video gamers shows that taking guarana 500 mg in combination with microalgae extract 440-880 mg daily for 30 days does not improve most measures of accuracy, reaction time, or gaming performance when compared to baseline (111360).\n\nA meta-analysis of 8 small clinical studies in healthy adults, that includes many of these studies, shows that taking a single dose of guarana 37.5-500 mg (median dose 222 mg; caffeine content 4-100 mg), alone or with other ingredients (i.e., B vitamins, vitamin C), within 360 minutes before a cognitive task does not improve overall cognitive performance or accuracy, but modestly improves reaction time when compared with placebo. In addition, cognitive performance was not related to guarana dose (111359). The validity of this analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies which utilized widely varying doses and various cognitive tests.\nless\nDysmenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral guarana for dysmenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of guarana for this condition.\nDyspepsia. Although there has been interest in using oral guarana for dyspepsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of guarana for this purpose.\nErectile dysfunction (ED). Oral guarana has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nIn middle-aged patients with ED, preliminary clinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (Revactin, MD Concepts LLC) containing guarana 125 mg, muira puama 125 mg, ginger root 125 mg, and L-citrulline 400 mg twice daily for 3 months improves scores related to erectile function and intercourse satisfaction, but not sexual desire or orgasmic function, when compared to baseline (103224). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a placebo control, the use of per-protocol analysis, and a high dropout rate. In fact, 44% of patients withdrew in order to resume use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Further, it is unclear if these effects are due to guarana, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nFatigue. Although there has been interest in using oral guarana for fatigue, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of guarana for this purpose.\nHeadache. Although there has been interest in using oral guarana for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of guarana for this purpose.\nObesity. Oral guarana has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nOne very small exploratory clinical study in overweight females shows that taking guarana 855 mg, yerba mate 1008 mg, and damiana 325 mg in divided doses daily for up to 45 days delays gastric emptying, increases satiety, and modestly improves weight loss when compared to baseline (11866). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group.\nless\nPsychological well-being. It is unclear if oral guarana is beneficial for improving feelings of well-being.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that taking guarana 1080 mg daily after breakfast for 5 days does not improve feelings of well-being or mood in healthy individuals (91490).\nless\nRadiation-induced fatigue. It is unclear if oral guarana is beneficial for improving fatigue related to radiation therapy.\nDetails: A small clinical trial shows that taking guarana 75 mg daily does not improve symptoms of depression or fatigue when compared with placebo in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy treatments (91481).",
            "Dosing & Administration": "Adult\nOral:\nGuarana extract has most often been taken as a single dose of 37.5-222 mg. It has also been used, often in combination with other ingredients, in doses of 75-100 mg daily for up to 4 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.\n\nGuarana extract is often standardized to 6.46% to 12% caffeine and 1.47% to 1.7% tannins (54374, 91482, 91484, 91487).\nStandardization & Formulation\nGuarana is often standardized to caffeine and tannin content. In general, guarana contains 3.6% to 5.8% caffeine, which is higher than the 1% to 2% found in coffee (11845). Guarana extracts used in clinical research often contain higher caffeine content. One specific guarana extract (Pharmanostra) contains 7.97% caffeine and 1.47% tannin (91487). Another guarana extract (Cathedral Pharmaceutical Industry) contains 6.46% caffeine and 1.7% tannins (91482). A third guarana extract (PC-102, Pharmaton, SA) contains 11% to 12% caffeine (54374, 91484).",

Caffeine is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine at the cellular level. However, caffeine does not seem to affect supplemental adenosine because high interstitial levels of adenosine overcome the antagonistic effects of caffeine (11771). It is recommended that methylxanthines and methylxanthine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests (11770). However, methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing (11771).\nless\nALCOHOL (Ethanol)\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nD (Theoretical based on pharmacology)\nTheoretically, alcohol might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.\nGuarana contains caffeine.

Caffeine can increase the effects and toxicity of clozapine. Caffeine doses of 400-1000 mg per day inhibit clozapine metabolism (5051). Clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Researchers speculate that caffeine might inhibit CYP1A2. However, there is no reliable evidence that caffeine affects CYP1A2. There is also speculation that genetic factors might make some patients more sensitive to the interaction between clozapine and caffeine (13741).\nless\nCONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS\nInteraction Rating\nMINOR Be watchful with this combination.\nSeverity\nMILD\nOccurrence\nPOSSIBLE\nLevel of Evidence\nB (Nonrandomized clinical trial)\nTheoretically, concomitant use might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine found in guarana.\nGuarana contains caffeine.

Caffeine has been shown to inhibit MAO-A and -B in laboratory studies (37724, 37877, 37912, 38108). Concomitant intake of large amounts of caffeine with MAOIs might precipitate a hypertensive crisis (15).

Until more is known, use with caution. Some research suggests that caffeine may impair postprandial glucose metabolism in people with diabetes and contribute to insulin resistance. The effect of caffeinated beverages and herbs has not been studied (12374, 12375). Caffeine in guarana may enhance the frequency and intensity of hypoglycemic warning symptoms in type 1 diabetics. Theoretically, this may increase the ability of diabetics to detect and treat hypoglycemia early. However, it might also increase the frequency of hypoglycemic events (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740). Caffeine has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose (8646).\nless\nDIARRHEA\nUse with caution in patients with diarrhea. Guarana contains caffeine which can exacerbate diarrhea, especially when taken in large amounts.\nless\nEPILEPSY\nGuarana contains caffeine. Caffeine might induce seizures and decrease the efficacy of some anticonvulsant drugs. Avoid using caffeine in high doses. Low doses of caffeine should be used with caution. Some animal research indicates that high doses of caffeine can significantly reduce seizure threshold or induce seizures (23559, 23560, 23561). Furthermore, caffeine seems to decrease the activity of various anticonvulsant drugs, including carbamazepine, ethosuximide, felbamate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate (23558, 23559, 23560, 23561, 23562, 23563).

Guarana contains caffeine, which increases intraocular pressure within 30 minutes and persists for at least 90 minutes (8540).\nless\nHYPERTENSION\nUse with caution in patients with hypertension. Guarana contains caffeine. Short-term caffeine consumption can temporarily increase blood pressure. Usually, increases in blood pressure occur 30 minutes after caffeine ingestion, peak in 1-2 hours, and may last for over 4 hours (36539, 37732, 37989, 38000, 38300). Increases are generally small and not clinically significant, being less than the normal diurnal variation in blood pressure (98806). Regular consumption of caffeine does not seem to increase blood pressure even in mildly hypertensive patients (1451, 1452, 2722, 38335). Caffeine consumption does not increase the risk of developing chronic hypertension (38190).\nless\nINCONTINENCE\nUse with caution in patients with urinary incontinence. Guarana contains caffeine which acts as a diuretic. Caffeine intake of more than 400 mg daily worsened detrusor instability (urge incontinency) in older females (36346).

Guarana contains caffeine, which might worsen symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS, especially when taken in large amounts (100526).\nless\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nUse with caution in postmenopausal patients identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor. Guarana contains caffeine which can increase urinary excretion of calcium due to its caffeine content, although the levels in urine usually remain within the normal range (98806). In some studies, higher caffeine intake is associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk (37554, 37949, 37956, 38145). However other population research shows that caffeine intake is not associated with decreased BMD (36351, 37756, 38295). Some sources suggest that caffeine consumption should be limited to less than 300 mg per day unless there is adequate calcium supplementation to compensate for calcium losses (2669, 10202, 11317). However, according to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, healthy adults with adequate calcium intake are not at increased risk for decreased BMD, osteoporosis, or fractures with daily caffeine intakes up to 400 mg (11733, 98806). Postmenopausal people identified with a genetic variant of the vitamin D receptor appear to have an 8% higher risk for bone loss from caffeine (2669).\nless",

Symptoms of caffeine toxicity included heart palpitations, chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension, ventricular fibrillation, hypotension, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, elevated creatinine, nausea, and vomiting (95503).\n\nLarge doses of caffeine can cause massive catecholamine release and subsequent sinus tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, ketosis, and death (11838, 11845, 13734, 13735). When taken orally, caffeine can also cause hypokalemia and respiratory alkalosis (11832, 11838, 13735).\nTreatment\nIn a case report of caffeine toxicity related to the intake of guarana extract, treatment included antiemetics, intravenous fluids and H2 receptor antagonists, followed by potassium and mild alkalinization, as well as an antiarrhythmic, beta-blocker, and acetylsalicylic acid (95503).",
            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available about the pharmacokinetics of guarana.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable part of guarana is the seed. Guarana contains 2 to 7.5% caffeine; compared to 1% to 2% in coffee (11845, 95503). Guarana also contains other purine alkaloids in smaller amounts, such as theophylline, and theobromine, as well as tannins such as catechin and epicatechin (54393, 54404, 54441, 54442). Constituents of guarana seed oil include cyanolipids, such as 1-cyano-2-hydroxymethylprop-2-ene-1-ol, as well as fatty acids such as cis-vaccenic acid, cis-11-eicosenoic acids, paullinic acid, and oleic acid (54370). Guarana essential oil contains phenylpropenes such as anethole and estragole, as well as cyclic terpenoids (54413).\nAnti-Parkinson effects\nFor preventing Parkinson disease, caffeine, the main constituent of guarana, may protect dopaminergic neurons in the brain. This effect appears to be related to modulation of adenosine receptors (10201). This may result in a reduction in the clinical expression of Parkinsonism (6022).\nAthletic performance effects\nCaffeine, the main constituent of guarana, stimulates the muscles (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (6370).\n\nFor improving athletic performance, caffeine has been shown to decrease perceived levels of exertion, which enables the athlete to feel less tired and increase their performance (6370). Caffeine alone or in combination with ephedrine can improve anaerobic exercise performance. Caffeine seems to enhance muscle metabolism and increases time to exhaustion and oxygen deficit, which may lead to better performance (8646).\n\nPreliminary evidence suggests caffeine may increase levels of intracellular calcium in skeletal muscle; but the mechanisms are poorly understood (6370).\nCardiovascular effects\nCaffeine, the main constituent of guarana, stimulates the heart, and possibly the pressor centers that control blood pressure (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). Caffeine can also acutely elevate both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, but might not have this effect in habitual users (2722).\n\nCaffeine may be beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. There is evidence caffeine inhibits platelet aggregation and suppresses thromboxane formation during blood clotting (8028, 8029, 54378, 54388, 54435).\n\nStudies have suggested caffeine possibly influences cardiovascular stress reactivity, either by potentiating the stress response itself or adding to the level reached during stress (6372). Caffeine can have positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart (11836). Caffeine may cause a slight decrease in heart rate after consumption and appears to raise blood pressure during psychological stress (6372). Large amounts of caffeine, >10 mg/kg/day, can also produce tachycardia and premature ventricular contractions (6372).\n\nEvidence suggests that tolerance to caffeine's cardiovascular effects may develop during consumption throughout the day, but tolerance appears to be lost during overnight abstinence of caffeine (6372).\nDiuretic effects\nCaffeine, the main constituent of guarana, exerts a diuretic effect, with water losses estimated at 1.17 mL per milligram of caffeine (2712). Tachyphylaxis to the diuretic effect develops rapidly, diminishing fluid losses associated with caffeine intake (10206). Caffeine-containing beverages consumed during moderate endurance exercise do not appear to compromise bodily hydration status (2713). Also, caffeine does not substantially affect the fluid status of people who drink caffeinated beverages on a regular basis (10206).\nEnergy effects\nCaffeine, the main constituent of guarana, is thought to be responsible for increasing energy by stimulating the central nervous system (CNS) (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). Caffeine's CNS stimulant effects are thought to improve vigilance and psychomotor performance (2720, 10205). However, some researchers believe that other compounds found in guarana may also play a role in the energy-increasing effects of guarana which may result in increased stimulant effects over caffeine alone. Guarana extract is able to induce a stimulatory effect in a specific laboratory model using an organism not stimulated by caffeine (91486).\nGlucose effects\nIn vitro research suggests that polyphenols isolated from guarana powder inhibit alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase enzymes, which could contribute to antihyperglycemic effects (99050).\n\nCaffeine, the main constituent of guarana, has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose. In people with type 2 diabetes, acute administration of caffeine impairs postprandial glucose metabolism, while acute abstention from caffeine reduces postprandial glucose levels by 21%. Whether these effects also occur with caffeinated beverages and herbs is unknown (12374). Other research in obese people suggests that caffeine ingestion may contribute to insulin resistance (12375, 13744). However, one study found that patients with type 1 diabetes taking 200 mg of caffeine twice daily had increased frequency and intensity of warning signs of hypoglycemia. This may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the brain and an increase in glucose utilization by the brain (6024). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine (13740).\nHormonal effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests caffeine, the main constituent of guarana, may increase plasma levels of cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH); but the mechanisms are poorly understood (6370). In human research, acute caffeine ingestion induces a rise in epinephrine and norepinephrine levels (36476, 54411).\n\nThere is also evidence caffeine might be associated with decreased levels of testosterone and increased levels of estrone and sex-hormone binding globulin. These findings might explain why some studies have reported associations between caffeine and hormone-dependent conditions such as fibrocystic disease, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and endometriosis (8043).\nNeurologic effects\nCaffeine, the main constituent of guarana, stimulates the central nervous system (CNS) (2722). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (2722). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (6370). It has also been proposed that caffeine may decrease GABA and serotonin signaling (6370). Caffeine's CNS stimulant effects are thought to improve vigilance and psychomotor performance (2720, 10205). Caffeine increases plasma catecholamine levels (11837), possibly through antagonism of adenosine receptors and reducing extraneuronal uptake of catecholamines (38234).\nRespiratory effects\nCaffeine, the main constituent of guarana, decreases airway resistance and stimulates respiration via adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition (11836).\nWeight loss effects\nCaffeine, the main constituent of guarana, increases resting energy expenditure (REE) and cellular thermogenesis. It also causes an increase in nonoxidative fatty acid turnover and lipid oxidation; however, the net effect on lipid oxidation is small. The effects of caffeine on energy expenditure and lipid metabolism seem to be mediated by both sympathetic and nonsympathetic mechanisms (13733). Caffeine is often used in combination with ephedra for weight loss and seems to have additive pharmacodynamic effects. A single dose of ephedra in combination with caffeine can increase heart rate from 67 beats per minute to 82 beats per minute in young, healthy people. The combination also increases systolic blood pressure and to a lesser extent, diastolic pressure (8644). Caffeine in combination with ephedra also increases oxygen consumption. Whether the increased oxygen consumption is an indication of a significant increase in metabolism and contributes to weight loss is unknown (8645). Caffeine also stimulates gastric acid secretion (11837)."

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of guava are the leaf and fruit. The flowers, root, bark, and stem are also used medicinally (95557, 101781). The leaves contain the flavonoids quercetin, avicularin, guaijaverin. The leaves also contain tannin, apigenin, and other polyphenols, triterpenes, saponins, lectins, carotenoids, vitamin C, and fatty acids (14267, 14270, 95557, 101758). Guava leaf essential oil contains cineol, limonene, eugenol, caryophyllene, pinene, and myrcene. The volatile constituents include cinnamic acid and hexenoic acid (14267, 101781). The guava fruit contains vitamin C (14267, 95560). The fruit pulp and peel contain about 49% fiber and about 3% to 8% polyphenols (14271). Guava bark and root are high in tannins (101781). The flower buds are rich in flavonoids (101781).\nAnticancer effects\nGuava leaf extracts have high polyphenol content and are thought to have anticancer effects (14267, 95557). In vitro research has found that guava leaf extracts are cytotoxic against leukemia cells, oral cancer cells, and other cancers. Polyphenols such as apigenin and lycopene have antioxidant effects and scavenge free radicals helping to prevent the development of cancerous cells (14268, 95557).\nAntidiabetic effects\nGuava leaf extract has shown hypoglycemic effects, possibly related to increased synthesis of liver glycogen (14267, 101755). Guava fruit has also been shown to lower fasting blood glucose levels in an animal model. This effect has been attributed to the fiber content of the fruit (14276). Preliminary clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that eating 400 grams of ripe guava WITH peel daily for 6 weeks increases fasting blood glucose compared to baseline. On the other hand, eating guava 400 grams WITHOUT peel seems to decrease fasting blood glucose compared to baseline. The hypoglycemic effect of the guava WITHOUT peel is thought to be due to alpha-glucosidase inhibition in the intestine, which reduces glucose absorption (95559).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro, guava leaf extract, especially the pink variety, have antimicrobial effects (14267, 101754, 101781).\nCardiovascular effects\nResearch in healthy volunteers shows that eating 400 grams of ripe guava fruit daily for 6 weeks OR drinking 500 mL of guava fruit juice once is associated with reduced blood pressure compared to baseline (95559, 95563). This reduction might be related to a reduction in weight in the 6 week study (95559). Additionally, guava leaf extract seems to have negative inotropic effects on animal cardiac tissue ex vivo which also helps explain guava's blood pressure lowering effects (14267).\n\nIn healthy volunteers, consuming guava fruit WITH peel 400 grams/day for 4-6 weeks seems to increase total cholesterol, and triglycerides compared to baseline and control. However effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were mixed (14273, 95559). On the other hand, eating guava 400 grams WITHOUT peel seems to decrease total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increase HDL cholesterol compared to baseline (95559). Additionally, some research suggests that guava fruit lowers cholesterol at higher intake amounts and longer duration of intake.\n\nThere are a few theories as to why guava affects cholesterol levels. One theory is that the cholesterol lowering effects of guava are due to the soluble fiber, pectin, content of the guava pulp (95559). Another theory is that guava decreases cholesterol levels due to its antioxidant effects. Guava fruit pulp and peel extracts seem to have antioxidant activity and decrease LDL oxidation in vitro (14271, 14272, 14273). In animals, the leaf extract inhibits hormone sensitive lipase (101755).\n\nFinally, in vitro, blood taken from healthy volunteers who drank 500 mL of guava fruit juice 10 minutes prior to giving blood demonstrates reduced collagen-induced platelet aggregation but not adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation compared to baseline (95563).\nGastrointestinal effects\nGuava leaf extracts are thought to have antidiarrheal effects (14267, 101781). In animal models, the guava leaf extract seems to decrease peristalsis in the intestine. This might be due to the flavonoid constituents such as quercetin. These constituents seem to decrease intracellular calcium release, which could result in decreased smooth muscle contraction (14267, 14269).\nNeurologic effects\nPreliminary research in animal models suggests that guava leaf extracts have antinociceptive and CNS depressant effects (14267).\nRespiratory effects\nPreliminary research in animal models suggests that guava leaf extract has antitussive effects (14267)."

Topical guggul has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear.\nA small study in adults with symptomatic mild to moderate (first- and second-degree) internal hemorrhoids shows that application of a cream containing sesame oil and aqueous extracts of guggul and Allium ampeloprasum as a thin layer to the anus twice daily for 3 weeks improves anal irritation and itching, bleeding, pain, defecation discomfort, and swelling sense when compared to baseline. In contrast, patients using a placebo cream experienced an improvement only in anal itching (105751). The poor study methodology and lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group limit the validity of these findings.\nless\nHypercholesterolemia. Several small, low-quality clinical studies in Indian populations suggest that oral guggul may reduce cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia; however, more recent evidence in patients on Western diets contradicts these findings.\nA small clinical study in patients with hypercholesterolemia following a Western diet shows that taking guggul 1-2 grams three times daily for 8 weeks increases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 9% to 10% with no improvements in total cholesterol, triglycerides, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo (10371). Another small clinical study in adults with hyperlipidemia and low to moderate cardiovascular risk shows that taking a methanolic extract of guggul 200 mg along with an aqueous extract of Terminalia and Indian gooseberry 450 mg three times daily for 3 months does not improve total, LDL, or HDL cholesterol levels or triglyceride levels when compared with placebo (105741). This is in contrast to several low-quality studies of guggul in Indian populations, which show that taking guggul extract (guggulipid) 1-2.25 grams two to three times daily for up to 16 weeks seems to lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared with baseline measures, placebo, or other controls (366, 3267, 8158, 51219, 54485, 54497, 54508). Also, some clinical research shows that taking a specific guggul extract fraction called \"Fraction A\" 500 mg three times daily for up to 75 weeks can reduce cholesterol and triglycerides in Indian patients with hypercholesterolemia (54492, 54501). Most of the studies with positive findings were published in the 1970s and 1980s and may not be generalizable to patients on Western diets or taking conventional antihyperlipidemic agents, most of which were approved after the publication of these findings.\nless\nOsteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral guggul is beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis.\nTwo small clinical studies in patients with osteoarthritis show that taking guggul may improve pain and other symptoms of osteoarthritis, measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) assessment, when compared to baseline (54453, 111720). One study used guggul (containing 3.5% guggulsterones) 500 mg three times daily for 2 months (54453) and the other used a polyherbal ayurvedic formulation, abha guggulu, 1500 mg two times daily for 1 month (111720). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group.\nless\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral guggul is beneficial in patients with RA.\nA small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with RA shows that taking guggul 1 gram three times daily for 4 months improves symptoms of RA when compared to baseline (54512). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of placebo group.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate guggul for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "There is insufficient reliable information available regarding the pharmacokinetics of guggul.",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nGuggul is an extract of the gum resin of the Commiphora mukul tree, which is native to India. The ketonic steroids Z-guggulsterone and E-guggulsterone are found in guggul extracts, including guggulipid, which is the ethyl acetate extract of the gum resin (3267, 54452, 54470, 54471, 54480). Several sesquiterpenoids have also been isolated from guggul extract (54454).\nAndrogenic effects\nAnimal research shows that guggul increases testosterone levels in a rat model of diabetes, suggesting that it may play a role in mitigating reductions in testosterone caused by various conditions, including diabetes. The mechanism of this pro-androgenic effect is unclear (103223).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGuggul extracts seem to have anti-inflammatory activity (8150). In vitro, the guggul constituent guggulsterone can suppress the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and downregulate the generation of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and nitric oxide (54462, 54463, 54469, 54472, 54479). Guggul might also lower lipoprotein (a) and C-reactive protein (10371).\nAntiacne effects\nGuggulipid might reduce secretion of sebum and inhibit bacterial metabolism of triglycerides which induces acne (3268, 54506).\nAntibacterial effects\nExtract, essential oil, and sesquiterpenoids isolated from the oleo-gum-resin of guggul have shown antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (54454).\nAnticoagulant/antiplatelet effects\nPreliminary evidence suggests guggul might have antiplatelet and anticoagulant activity (3267, 9557, 54487, 54493, 54505).\nAntidiabetic effects\nEvidence from animal research shows that guggulipid can improve glucose tolerance in mice with leptin deficiency, which is associated with insulin resistance. In vitro, guggulipid has been shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), PPAR-gamma, and liver X receptor-alpha (LXR-alpha) agonist activity. This may contribute to its antidiabetic effects (54474).\nAntilipemic effects\nGuggulsterones can inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver and seem to have an antioxidant effect on lipids (3267, 8156). Guggulsterones seem to antagonize the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which reduces the production of bile acids (12444, 54449, 54450, 54451, 54452, 54472, 54475). Evidence from animal research also suggests that guggulsterone can enhance low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol uptake by the liver (11803).\nAntineoplastic effects\nEvidence from in vitro research suggests that guggulsterone inhibits cancer cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest (54468, 54476, 54482). In vitro research also suggests that guggulsterone promotes apoptosis and suppresses metastasis of cancer cells (54460, 54468, 54471, 54476, 54482).\nAntioxidant effects\nIn lab and animal research, guggul extracts have been reported to possess antioxidant properties (54504). Evidence from animal research suggests that guggulsterone can reverse the increased lipid peroxide levels, increased xanthine oxidase activity, and lowered superoxide dismutase activity associated with isoproterenol-induced myocardial necrosis (8154, 54483).\nBone effects\nEvidence from in vitro research suggests that guggulsterone can suppress NF-kappaB activation and inhibit the differentiation of monocytes to osteoclasts (54463). This may reduce bone resorption and improve conditions such as osteoarthritis.\nCytochrome 450 effects\nGuggulsterones act as agonists of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), which induces the expression of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 (12444).\nFertility effects\nAnimal research shows that guggul improves sperm motility in a rat model of diabetes, suggesting that guggul might play a role in the treatment of male infertility. The antioxidant and pro-androgenic actions of guggul are thought to explain this effect (103223).\nHormone-modulating effects\nGuggulsterones act as agonists of estrogen-alpha receptor and progesterone receptor (12444).\nNeurologic effects\nEvidence from animal research suggests that guggulipid can decrease streptozotocin-induced increase in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and inhibit streptozotocin-induced deficits in memory in an animal model of dementia (54470).\nThyroid effects\nGuggulsterone also has thyroid-stimulating activity (8152, 8153, 8156, 54448, 54496). It seems to increase T3 synthesis by increasing conversion of T4 to T3 (8156)."

It is unclear if oral or topical gum arabic is beneficial for preventing or treating dental plaque.\nPreliminary clinical research shows that chewing gum arabic for 10 minutes, five times daily for 7 days, reduces dental plaque when compared with chewing sugar-free gum (30220). Another small clinical study in adults with mild or moderate plaque-induced gingivitis shows that applying half a teaspoon of gum arabic powder to the buccal surface of dentogingivial areas for 5 minutes then rinsing with tap water twice daily for 60 days reduces dental plaque in patients with moderate, but not high, plaque accumulation when compared with placebo (111508).\n\nGum arabic has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for this purpose. A small clinical study shows that applying a pea-size amount of gel containing gum arabic, barleria, medlar, terminalia, and melia (Gum Tone Gel, Charak Pharma Pvt Ltd.) after brushing for 6 weeks decreases plaque severity when compared with placebo. The gel is similar in effectiveness to chlorhexidine 1% gel (92887). However, it's unclear if these findings are due to gum arabic, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral gum arabic is beneficial in patients with diabetes.\nClinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes who are taking oral antidiabetes medications shows that taking gum arabic powder 30 grams daily in the morning for 3 months modestly reduces fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with baseline. Gum arabic also modestly reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, body mass index, and hip circumference, but not waist circumference or blood pressure, when compared with baseline (98700, 99098).

While an improvement in direct bilirubin levels was observed when compared to baseline, no significant changes in serum levels of total bilirubin, albumin, protein, liver enzymes, urea, or creatinine were reported (102087). However, in this same group of patients, gum arabic did reduce levels of total cholesterol by 8 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 12 mg/dL when compared with baseline.

            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of gumweed are the dried top and leaf (2, 101897). Gumweed is rich in diterpenes, including grindelic acid,6-oxygrindelic acid, 18-hydroxy-6- oxygrindelic acid, 7-alphaoxodihydrogrindelic acid, and 8-alpha-oxodihydrogrindelic acid (54540, 54544, 54545, 54546, 101897, 110418). Other major constituents include monoterpenes (alpha-pinene, limonene, beta-pinene, and terpinolene), oxygenated monoterpenes (borneol, p-cymen-8-ol, bornyl acetate, trans-pinocarveol, and myrtenol), and the oxygenated sesquiterpene, spathulenol. Gumweed also contains flavonoids such as acacetin, kumatakenin and quercetin, labdane-type triterpenes, triterpene saponins, tannins, polyacetylenes, phenolic acids, and essential oils (54545, 110419).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nGumweed is traditionally used for respiratory tract inflammation. In vitro, essential oils from gumweed, and their constituent, borneol, down-regulate human neutrophil activation by reducing calcium influx, and also reduce neutrophil chemotaxis (110419). In human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, a gumweed extract and its constituent grindelic acid reduce cell receptor expression, and NF-kappa-beta concentrations. This reduces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1-beta, and IL-6. The extract also stimulates the anti-inflammatory activity of macrophages, and grindelic acid inhibits pathways that lead to activation of various inflammatory cells (101897, 110418, 110419).\nAntibacterial effects\nIn vitro, some extracts of gumweed have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, Aeromonas caviae, Micrococcus luteus, and Paenibacillus alvei (2, 110418)."

            "Overview": "The gymnema plant is a climbing plant, with small yellow flowers. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions in India, as well as other parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia (92120, 92121, 92122, 95005). Gymnema has traditionally been used in Ayurvedic medicine for various purposes, including respiratory conditions, heart and liver health, constipation, amenorrhea, eye health, and snakebite (92119, 92120, 92121, 92122, 110022).",
            "Safety": "POSSIBLY SAFE when used orally and appropriately. Gymnema leaf extract has been used safely in doses of 200 mg twice daily for up to 20 months or 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks (45, 46, 42604, 105346).\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
            "Adverse Effects": "General\nOrally, gymnema seems to be well tolerated.\nHepatic\nA case of drug-induced hepatitis characterized by weakness, fatigue, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes, has been reported for a patient who consumed gymnema tea three times daily for 10 days. The patient was administered prednisone 60 mg once daily and was eventually tapered off prednisone and discharged. Laboratory values normalized after 6 months (95005). A case of hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia characterized by jaundice, elevated liver function tests, and pancytopenia has been reported for a patient who consumed gymnema 2 grams twice daily for at least a month. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid for 8 weeks led to resolution of cholestatic hepatitis; however, the pancytopenia was not responsive to treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and the patient died 5 months after presentation (110021). The exact reason for these adverse effects is not clear; they may have been idiosyncratic.\nless",
            "Effectiveness": "EXPAND ALL\n|\nCOLLAPSE ALL\nINSUFFICIENT RELIABLE EVIDENCE TO RATE\nDiabetes. It is unclear if oral gymnema is beneficial for diabetes.\nA meta-analysis of 10 small clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking gymnema modestly reduces fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels, and also seems to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), when compared to baseline. Gymnema may also modestly reduce total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. (110022). Another meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies, that includes some of the same studies, also shows that taking gymnema modestly reduces fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared with diet or placebo. However, this analysis shows that gymnema does not improve HbA1c, oral glucose tolerance, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (112184). The validity of these analyses is limited by the inclusion of mostly low-quality studies that enrolled heterogeneous patient populations and employed varying gymnema dosing regimens of 0.4-10 grams daily, sometimes in conjunction with antidiabetes medications. In addition, many of the included studies were non-randomized and lacked a comparator group.\nless\nImpaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral gymnema is beneficial for impaired glucose tolerance.\nOne small clinical study in overweight or obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking gymnema (Swanson Superior Herbs) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve glucose control, lipid profile, anthropometric indices, or blood pressure when compared with placebo (105346). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups.\nless\nMetabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral gymnema is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking gymnema leaf (Swanson Premium G. sylvestre leaf, Swanson Health Products) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight by 4% and body mass index (BMI) by 2% when compared to baseline in overweight adults with metabolic syndrome. However, it is unclear if these changes are significant when compared with placebo. In addition, gymnema does not appear to improve blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, or blood lipid levels when compared with placebo (96235).\nless\nObesity. It is unclear if oral gymnema improves weight loss in overweight or obese adults.\nOne small clinical study shows that taking gymnema leaf (Swanson Premium G. sylvestre leaf, Swanson Health Products) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces body weight and body mass index (BMI) when compared to baseline in overweight adults with metabolic syndrome. However, it is unclear if these changes are significant when compared with placebo (96235). Another small clinical study by the same authors evaluating overweight adults with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking gymnema (Swanson Superior Herbs) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight or BMI when compared with placebo (105346).\n\nGymnema has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical study shows that taking a combination of gymnema extract 400 mg, hydroxycitric acid 2800 mg, and niacin-bound chromium 4 mg orally daily for 8 weeks decreases BMI and body weight when compared to baseline in overweight and obese adults. This product provided 400 mcg of elemental chromium and 100 mg of gymnemic acids (42604). It is unclear if these effects are due to gymnema, other ingredients, or the combination.\nless\nMore evidence is needed to rate gymnema for these uses.",

            "Pharmacokinetics": "Absorption\nGymnemic acid, a component of gymnema, appears to have poor lipid solubility, and is difficult to absorb (92121).",
            "Mechanism of Action": "General\nThe applicable parts of gymnema are the leaves and roots (92121). The leaves contain oleanane and dammarane triterpene saponins. These are the primary constituents responsible for gymnema's effects (92120, 92121). Oleanane triterpenes include gymnemic acids and gymnemasaponins. Dammarane triterpenes include gymnemasides (54561, 54582, 95005). The largest amount of gymnemic acid is found in the shoot tips. Anthraquinones, flavonoids, tartaric acid, formic acid, butyric acid, gumarin, gymnemagenol, gymnemanol, gymmestrogenin quercitol, stigmasterol, alkaloids, and beta-amyrin related glycosides are also found in gymnema (12549, 54561, 54581, 92121, 92122, 92123).\nAnti-inflammatory effects\nAnimal research shows that gymnema leaf extract has anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of gymnema extract are attributed to saponin, tannin, and steroid constituents (92121).\nAntimicrobial effects\nIn vitro research shows that gymnema extract has antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus but not E. coli and Proteus vulgaris (14861, 92121).\nHypoglycemic effects\nGymnema extracts lower blood glucose in animal models and humans with diabetes (45, 46). However, fasting levels of blood glucose are not reduced in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or metabolic syndrome (96235, 105346). Gymnemic acids seem to reduce intestinal absorption of glucose and may stimulate pancreatic beta-cell growth (47, 48, 11367). Other research suggests that constituents of gymnema have a direct effect on beta-cell function, increasing the release of insulin (12549). Gymnema can increase serum C-peptide levels, suggesting an increase in endogenous insulin secretion (45).\nImmunomodulatory effects\nLaboratory research shows that a methanolic extract of gymnema can stimulate nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from peritoneal macrophages, in a concentration dependent manner. A lower concentration of extract appears to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation, while a higher concentration is needed for production of ROS and NO. Gymnemic acid also appears to stimulate splenic T and B cell proliferation. Higher immunomodulatory activity was seen when the extract was combined with other immunostimulatory substances, such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (92120).\nLipid effects\nGymnema leaf extract has been shown to lower serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in animal models of hyperlipidemia (54578, 54579, 92119). However, these effects have not been shown in human research (105346). Some animal research shows that gymnemic acid, a constituent of gymnema leaf extract, can inhibit the intestinal absorption of the fatty acid oleic acid; this may be one mechanism by which gymnema lowers cholesterol (54580). Other animal research shows that gymnemic acids may reduce cholesterol levels by increasing fecal cholesterol excretion (94670).\n\nIn animal models of metabolic syndrome, gymnema seems to decrease weight gain and triglycerides but does not affect serum cholesterol (14859).\nTaste effects\nGymnemic acid and gurmarin, constituents of gymnema, inhibit the ability to taste bitter (quinine) or sweet (sugar) flavors, without affecting the ability to taste sour, astringent, or pungent flavors (11292, 92121). Two clinical studies show that taking a mint tablet containing gymnemic acids reduces the consumption of sweet foods (i.e., chocolate bars) when compared with placebo; this effect is theoretically due to a reduced desire for the chocolate due to change in taste, not a change in appetite (105347,112183 )."
